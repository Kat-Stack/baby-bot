rater earth fire air my grandmother used to tell me stories about the old days a time of peace when the avatar kept balance between the water tribes earth kingdom fire nation and air nomads but that all changed when the fire nation attacked only the avatar mastered all four elements only he could stop the ruthless firebenders but when the world needed him most he vanished a hundred years have passed and the fire nation is nearing victory in the war two years ago my father and the men of my tribe journeyed to the earth kingdom to help fight against the fire nation leaving me and my brother to look after our tribe some people believe that the avatar was never reborn into the air nomads and that the cycle is broken but i havent lost hope i still believe that somehow the avatar will return to save the world
as the title card fades the scene opens onto a shot of an icy sea before panning slowly to the left revealing more towering icebergs drifting in the water as the shot rotates moving over a large snowcovered area where the untouched blanket of snow is broken by two tracks of footsteps the shot fades to another shot of the sea and of icebergs in blue water contrasted by the paleness of the sky beyond as the shot once again pans to the left and rotates likewise a small canoe comes into view its motion through the water indicated by the wake left behind it the shot zooms slightly on the canoe before cutting down to it providing a side angle of the canoe and of the walls of ice rising on either side of the vessel two people a boy and a girl are sitting in the boat the boy holds a spear at the ready while the girl simply stares into the water on the other side of the boat the shot cuts to an overhead view revealing that a fish is swimming close to the surface right in front of the boy who is focused on it following its every movement cut to a frontal view of him
its not getting away from me this time closeup of the boy as he grins confidently over his shoulder in the direction of the girl watch and learn katara this is how you catch a fish
the shot pans quickly from the boy to katara who seems indifferent to his claim and turns back to her side of the boat again her expression changes to surprise as the shot jumps behind her looking down into the water over her shoulder another fish quickly swims by her close to where she sits she shoots a quick glance toward her brother removing the glove from her left hand she stretches her arm out in the direction of the fish taking a deep breath her look is a mixture of concentration and apprehension as she starts making a wavy motion with her wrist moving her hand up and down
the shot widens out sokka still focused wholly on the fish in front of him is completely unaware of what is happening behind his back as katara continues to move her hand the water in front of katara just in front of the shot starts to ripple suddenly a bubble of water rises up from the ocean containing the newly trapped fish
happily surprised sokka look
closeup of sokka whispering sshh katara youre going to scare it away a look of bliss adorns his face he licks his lips and wiggles his fingers not taking his eyes off the fish mmmm  i can already smell it cookin
behind sokka katara is still making circular movements with both her arms suspending the bubble of water that holds the fish in the air and moving back and forth the camera cuts to her face contorted slightly by the focus it takes to control the water
struggling with the water that passes right in front of her but sokka i caught one
the bubble containing her fish slowly drifts around her to hang over sokka who is still oblivious as the bubble hovers over his head sokka raises his spear to strike the fish he was following he bursts the bubble of water with the blunt end of his weapon causing katara to lose control of the water it rains down on sokka soaking him
exclaims indignantly hey
as sokka lets out a gasp of discomfort the fish tumbles through the air and katara follows its arc with her eyes as it flies over her head and splashes back into the sea sokka rounds on his sister placing his spear perpendicular to the rim of the boat as he yells irately the shot cuts to a closeup of him
why is it that every time you play with magic water i get soaked
sokka clenches his fists and a few drops of water fall from his soaked gloves
cut to her face she sighs lightly before answering in slight annoyance its not magic its waterbending and its 
yeah yeah an ancient art unique to our culture blah blah blah look im just saying grabbing his warriors wolf knot with his left hand as he turns away from her wringing the water out of it meanwhile katara has crossed her arms that if i had weird powers id keep my weirdness to myself
cut to her face as she raises an eyebrow skeptically arms still crossed youre calling me weird im not the one who makes muscles at myself every time i see my reflection in the water
near the end of her response katara smiles smugly at her brother as the shot cuts to him he is flexing at his reflection in the water and grinning confidently his happy look vanishes upon hearing his sisters remark and he turns around slowly meaning to face her before he can say anything however the canoe suddenly shudders as they both try to keep from falling over sokka whirls around toward his end of the canoe a frantic look on his face
the camera cuts to a far view of the canoe which pans up as the boat moves away from it the boat is caught in a rapid current which is pulling it swiftly toward a jumble of large icebergs which block the end of the narrow passage formed by the towering walls of ice sokka paddles the boat in an attempt to stay clear of any floating chunks of ice he manages to gain just enough speed to keep the boat from being crushed by two icebergs which slam together behind the boat a series of shots follows the canoe moving through the water as sokka rows furiously a closeup of sokkas head and a frontal shot of the canoe as it is nearly pinned by a number of smaller chunks of ice cut to kataras face both her face and voice full of panic as she yells commands to sokka
watch out go left go left
the shot shows an overview of the ice floes moving closer together in front of the boat narrowing their path the boat manages to stay clear of some of the icebergs but it veers to the right with the current and becomes pinned by three large chunks of ice as the canoe is completely crushed by the ice katara and sokka throw themselves from the canoe and onto one of the floes katara nearly slides off the other side into the water but comes to a halt at the floes very edge as she raises her head looking around the shot zooms out to reveal the siblings are floating on one floe among dozens
katara shuffling on her hands and knees moves away from the rim toward the middle of the floe sitting next to her brother his spear is embedded pointfirst in the ice just behind him
a touch of bitterness in her voice you call that left
you dont like my steering well maybe you shouldve he waves his hands mockingly imitating waterbending waterbended us out of the ice
the shot cuts to a wide shot of the two on their floe among the large icebergs and tiny floes surrounding them stands a massive towering shard of ice its craggy peak rising high above the siblings katara gets on her feet again facing sokka so that the pointed iceberg is behind her
indignantly so its my fault
annoyed i knew i shouldve left you home cut to a closeup of the siblings katara is staring down at her brother in anger while he rants calmly leave it to a girl to screw things up
cut to a closeup of kataras face as it contorts with fury the shot cuts to a side view as katara points accusingly at her brother who makes no movement as she screams her disgust at him the floe bobbing lightly up and down
you are the most sexist she brings her hands up to her head and swings them back down and behind her in her rage the movement creates a small wave of water behind her immature hands raised back to her head nut brained  swings her arms back down again creating a slightly larger wave she raises her hands back to her head during a brief loss for words im embarrassed throwing a hand upward a short jet of water shoots upward as well to be related to you
she swings both her hands back forcefully once again and her unconscious waterbending hurls a wave directly into the towering iceberg behind her with a loud splitting crack a hooklike fissure arcs up its surface and out its side leaving a spray of ice where it ends sokka who wears a somewhat disinterested expression glances briefly in his sisters direction and sees the iceberg after a short moment he does a doubletake his expression morphing into one of terror the shot cuts to show kataras outburst from behind sokka as she continues with her verbal outburst and arm movements little chunks of ice from the iceberg splash into the water unheard and unnoticed by katara
ever since mom died points to herself ive been doing all the work around camp while youve been off playing soldier
she emphasizes the last words with a strong swing of her hand waterbending and deepening the crack in the iceberg sokkas terror deepens
pointing to the iceberg behind her his voice subdued by fright uh  katara 
closeup of a ragefueled katara as she continues her outburst a finger pointed in sokkas face i even wash all the clothes have you ever smelled your dirty socks let me tell you not pleasant
as she yells out that last word she unconsciously waterbends once again causing two new splits in the chunk of ice
in a screeching voice his eyes open wide in fear katara settle down
no thats it im done helping you from now on youre on your own
her last movement is her most agitated and it creates a huge wave which when it impacts the  iceberg sends a number of fissures to snake their way up the iceberg one of them reaches the top of the iceberg splitting it completely in half petrified sokka gasps for air and it is only now that katara turns to look behind her she gasps and the shot cuts to the iceberg the two halves begin to fall away from each other and the siblings can be seen through the widening space between them the shot jumps to the siblings backs as the two halves collapse into the water a wave larger than any katara cast at it radiates outward toward them and they are thrown to the ice as it pushes their floe backward
as the waves subside the shot cuts to a headon closeup of the siblings their heads slightly over the edge of the ice sokka holding a protective arm over katara turns his head toward her
okay youve gone from weird to freakish he releases her katara
astonished you mean i did that
sarcastically glancing at her and smirking yep nudging her with his elbow congratulations
several small bubbles appear on the surface of the water directly in front of them and a small spot of water begins to glow with a bright bluish hue an overhead shot shows the spread of the brilliant glow and the bubbles within cut to the headon closeup as the two siblings scramble back in renewed terror from the edge just as a large roughly spherical iceberg breaks the surface of the water
the shot jumps behind katara and sokka as an iceberg rises above the surface revealing its massive form to be the source of the glow the crashing waves generated by the icebergs rising push the floe backward as the berg itself rocks to one side before coming to rest with its rounded dome exposed above the water mesmerized by the iceberg katara strays closer and stares at the iceberg behind her sokka halfheartedly stretches out his hand as if to hold her back a few cuts ensue the iceberg from behind sokka and katara kataras face as she stares at the object and a shot of the iceberg itself revealing a human shape within below a larger indistinguishable mass the human figure perched in lotus has glowing arrows on its head and hands closeup of katara as she raises an eyebrow in confusion the shot cuts to a closer view of the figure in the ice its features accentuated by reflected light revealing it to be a boy suddenly the boy opens his eyes the same brilliant light emanating from them eliciting shocked gasps from both of the siblings
hes alive we have to help
before sokka can grab it katara grabs sokkas club out of its sheath on his back and pulls her hood over her head heading in the direction of the strange boy sealed in the iceberg sokka again reaches out his hand in an attempt to hold katara back though she is already running across the ice
katara get back here he grabs his spear from the ice and runs after katara who is already at the ices edge we dont know what that thing is
katara hops across the short distance between her floe and the iceberg on five tiny chinks of ice sokka close behind her does the same reaching the iceberg first katara repeatedly strikes the iceberg with sokkas club on her fifth strike the club breaks through the surface and a great gust of wind which escapes from within the iceberg throws her and her brother back from the side of the dome fissures quickly snake their way over the whole iceberg and in a massive outward explosion the entire orb of ice destroys itself a beam of light bursts from the core of the iceberg and rockets into the sky the camera shows the iceberg from the shallow sea bottom as it emits ripples of light the scene switches to a group of tiger seals who erect themselves to growl at the distant beam of light
cut to a fire nation ship where a boy in a fire nation military uniform stands on the deck gazing at the light his ponytail flutters in the wind
finally he turns around to face another person in uniform who sits at a small table uncle do you realize what this means
the man is playing some sort of card game he answers calmly while looking over the tile hes holding toward his nephew i wont get to finish my game
turning around again to face the light it means my search is about to come to an end
iroh sighs uninterestedly and places his tile on the table
gestures at the light while facing his uncle again that light came from an incredibly powerful source the light dwindles and disappears it has to be him
with continuing disinterest and an air of skepticism or its just the celestial lights weve been down this road before prince zuko he looks at the tile in his hand depicting the symbol of airbending i dont want you to get too excited over nothing he places it on a tile carrying the symbol of firebending and gestures toward the open place at the other side of the table while continuing in a relaxed voice please sit why dont you enjoy a cup of calming jasmine tea
furiously still facing iroh i dont need any calming tea i need to capture the avatar helmsman head a course for the light
zuko points in the direction of where the light once was iroh calmly continues with his game placing another tile bearing the airbending symbol on the previous one as he does a gust of wind washes over him shaking his tiles
cut to the iceberg where the gale has begun to settle sokka had protectively clutched katara but he now releases her as he looks around light still encircles the remains of the former mountain of ice now reduced to a hollowedout crater sokka looks at his sister and they both get to their feet katara holding onto her brother he points his spear at the crater ready to defend them though lowers it in shock as a figure emerges slowly from the depression in the iceberg
brandishing his spear in defense once again stop
now standing atop the crater the figure slowly erects himself and looks down at them and the two siblings stare back in wonder and fear
the circles of light finally dissipate as the boy stops glowing the figure is revealed to be nothing more than a young boy who gives a moan of exhaustion and suddenly faints katara gasps and runs forward to catch him before he hits the ground and sokka begins to poke at the boys head with the blunt end of his spear
waves the spear away annoyed stop it
katara places the boy gently against the base of the crater closeup of the boy as he slowly opens his gray eyes he gasps in awe as he beholds the southern water tribe girl who stares at him in relief with deep blue eyes her hair loopies sway in the wind
in a weak voice i need to ask you something 
what
please  come closer
curiously what is it
in a clear happy hopeful tone will you go penguin sledding with me
awkwardly uh sure  ii guess
the camera moves back again to show the threesome at the base of the iceberg the boy elegantly rises to his feet in one swift motion surprising the other two katara looks at him in awe while sokka backs away in shock aiming his spear at him again katara glances at him in disbelief
looking around and rubbing his head while katara scrambles on her feet whats going on here
aggressively you tell us points at the top of the crater how did you get in the ice and why arent you frozen he pokes the boy in his side with his spear
lazily pushes the spear away im  not sure
a low gruff noise suddenly fills the air coming from within the crater of the iceberg quickly the boy scrambles up the ridge of ice and happily jumps on the head of a large furry creature that has the same arrowshaped marking on his forehead as the boy
exclaims happily appa are you all right he hangs down the side of the beast to look at its eyes which are still closed wake up buddy
he opens an eyelid that immediately closes again once it is released he jumps down to the front of the bison and tries to lift its enormous head sokka and katara appear around the corner as appa finally starts to react to aang opening his mouth and licking aang with his giant tongue sokkas jaw drops upon seeing the beast
laughing cheerfully ha ha youre okay
aang hugs the bisons nose the camera moves back to reveal that the creature stands up on his six legs and stretches itself when the picture moves closer again aang is petting the bisons nose
what is that thing
this is appa my flying bison
sarcastically right and this is katara my flying sister katara shoots him an odd look
aang looks questioningly at sokka for a moment but his attention is diverted back toward his bison when appa starts to inhale deeply realizing what is about to happen aang ducks before appa sneezes sending a large blast of green flying directly onto sokka who becomes completely covered in it he squeals in disgust and begins to frantically try clean it off rubbing his face in the snow under the amused gaze of his sister
cheerfully dont worry itll wash out green slime is hanging from sokkas face to his glove dripping down as he retracts his hand katara covers her mouth in disgust so do you guys live around here
pointing his spear accusingly again at aang who is surprised to see the thing dont answer that did you see that crazy bolt of light he was probably trying to signal the fire navy
pushes sokkas spear away again and addresses him sarcastically oh yeah im sure hes a spy for the fire navy you can tell by that evil look in his eye aang shoots the two an earnest grin the paranoid one is my brother sokka you never told us your name
im a  aaaachoo the boy sneezes creating an air blast that sends him soaring into the air he lands on the ground unharmed im aang he sniffles a bit
total disbelief you just sneezed  points to the sky and flew ten feet in the air
he looks questioningly toward the sky really it felt higher than that
gasps for air in comprehension youre an airbender
sure am
giant light beams flying bison airbenders  walks away i think i got midnight sun madness im going home to where stuff makes sense he realizes however that he is stranded in the middle of the ocean with no way home
well if you guys are stuck appa and i can give you a lift aang airbends himself onto appa
wed love a ride thanks katara runs to the side of the bison
oh no im not getting on that fluffy snot monster
while climbing on top of appa with the help of aang are you hoping some other kind of monster will come along and give you a ride home you know before you freeze to death
sokka opens his mouth in defiance and point at katara ready to retaliate but he cannot think of anything he sighs and bows his head in consent and defeat
the camera switches to a shot where both siblings are sitting on appas saddle sokka has his arms crossed in front of him with a sulking expression on his face while katara is full of excitement and anticipation
okay first time flyers hold on tight appa yipyip
aang whips the reins and appa growls in response he moves his tail up and down and takes a huge jump into the air he soars through the air for mere few seconds making it appear as though he would fly before bellyflopping into the water with a splash the bison begins trudging through the water slowly katara crawls to the front of the saddle while aang tries to get appa flying whipping the reins again
come on appa yipyip
sarcastically wow that was truly amazing 
katara shoots her brother an angry glance appas just a little tired a little rest and hell be soaring through the sky youll see katara smiles at aang who returns this gesture when she wants to move back she realizes that he is still smiling at her
uncomfortably why are you smiling at me like that
oh i was smiling surprised katara smiles back
sokka throws his head back and sticks his tongue out in disgust while groaning loudly katara glares at him while appa continues to make his way through the icy sea flapping his tail in the water
the picture tilts up and fades away to reveal zuko standing on the helm of his ship staring into the distance the young man is approached by his uncle
im going to bed now yawns and stretches yep a man needs his rest after a short pause he abandons his try at a veiled suggestion and delivers his request more clearly his tone tired prince zuko you need some sleep even if youre right and the avatar is alive you wont find him your father grandfather and greatgrandfather all tried and failed
because their honor didnt hinge on the avatars capture mine does this cowards hundred years in hiding are over
the scene fades to appa who is still swimming in the water aang now lies lazily on his back his arms tucked under his head katara crawls to the front of the saddle again to have a better look at the boy she leans on the front of the saddle and rests her head on her arm
hey
hey whatcha thinkin about
i guess i was wondering your being an airbender and all if you had any idea what happened to the avatar
oh no i didnt know him i mean i knew people that knew him but i didnt sorry he smiles weakly at katara
okay just curious she slants her eyes in disappointment for a second before smiling again at aang good night
sleep tight
aang uncomfortably turns around and a look of guilt crosses his face the camera switches to another wide shot of appa swimming through the vast sea reflecting the brilliant sunlight
the scene switches to a dream of aangs colored in various shades of gray aang is sleeping on appas saddle while clouds build around and ahead of him lightning splits the sky and the rumble of the following thunder awakens him he shoots up and looks around in the next shot it is raining and aang is sitting on appas head again holding the reigns and screaming at the top of his lungs in terror while they go down appa and aang splash into the waters of the ocean appa resurfaces again growls but is quickly subdued anew by another wave both aang and appa sink unconscious into the water as aang releases the reigns and drifts off his eyes and tattoos suddenly start to glow brightly he slams his fists together creating a bluishwhite sphere that encases appa and himself as the air sphere slowly solidifies into an icy globe a voice permeates the dream
aang aang wake up aang shoots up throwing the covers of his body and gasping for air katara perches beside him and stands up as she sees that aang is awake its okay were in the village now come on get ready she points to the door of the tent everyones waiting to meet you
aang happily gets out of bed and starts to dress himself while katara takes a step toward the door before she exits however she glances back at aang and gasps staring in wonder at the blue arrowshaped tattoos that trace his arms and legs and reach up his back and to his head before aang is able to get up katara pulls him along by his arm to meet the rest of the village
aang is dragged out the tent toward a small congregation of villagers he passes sokka who is sitting at the side of the tent sharpening his boomerang
aang this is the entire village points to the line of villagers in front of them entire village aang
aang bows respectfully toward the villages but they cower away in fear bringing a surprised look to katara and aangs faces sokka just watches from a distance
uncomfortably uh why are they all looking at me like that did appa sneeze on me
aang checks his clothing while an elderly woman steps forward out of the line of villagers
well no one has seen an airbender in a hundred years we thought they were extinct until my granddaughter and grandson found you
shocked disbelief extinct
gesturing aang this is my grandmother
call me grangran
sokka walks toward aang and abruptly snatches his staff out of his hands and starts to examine it
annoyed what is this a weapon you cant stab anything with this
aang uses a small air current to get his staff back its not for stabbing its for airbending he opens his staff into a glider making sokka gasp in fright and cover his head with his hands
excited magic trick do it again
not magic airbending he moves his glider around him visually demonstrating what he is talking about it lets me control the air currents around my glider and fly
mockingly states his disbelief ya know last time i checked humans cant fly
accepting sokkas challenge smiling check again
aang grabs hold of his glider and pushes himself off the ground leaving katara and sokka to cover their faces against the sudden wind the village stares in awe as aang makes some loops and turns in the sky
in admiration hes flying
aang makes another loops and speeds up to soar past the gazing villagers
its amazing
aangs shadow passes over katara who is smiling broadly at him aang intending to further impress the villagers flies sideways and closes his eyes while grinning broadly he promptly flies headon into the villages watchtower causing his head to be stuck in its side katara covers her mouth as she watches aang struggle to extricate his head from the icy watchtower succeeding he tumbles downward onto a pile of snow at the base of the tower that crumbled from the building katara immediately rushes to his side while sokka stares in shock at the damage inflicted on his watchtower
shocked my watchtower
aang lies covered in snow at the base of the partially collapsed tower katara and some other girls of the tribe run toward aang smiling
offering her hand to pull him out of the snow that was amazing
sokka runs toward his watchtower and starts to pat it in the hope that he can save it from collapsing any further while aang spins his staff around to retract its wings sokka is being knocked down by a large pack of snow that falls down
annoyed great youre an airbender kataras a waterbender together you can just waste time all day long he wedges himself free from underneath the weight of the snow and stalks off
surprised and with admiration youre a waterbender
nervously well sort of not yet
all right no more playing come on katara you have chores
kanna leads katara away from aang the surrounding villagers part to let the duo pass
excitedly i told you hes the real thing grangran i finally found a bender to teach me
calmly katara try not to put all your hopes in this boy
but hes special i can tell clenches her fist and closes her eyes in hope i sense hes filled with much wisdom
katara opens her eyes again and glances back toward aang who is surrounded by a bunch of kids he smiles while his tongue is stuck to his staff
muffled see now my tongue is stuck to my staff
much to aangs discomfort one of the smaller village boys starts to yank his staff pulling aang along with every movement the village kids laugh and applaud aang as his tongue remains stuck to his staff
the scene shifts to zukos ship where zuko is facing two soldiers dressed in the uniforms of a firebending fire nation soldier iroh is sitting on a small chair next to them
sternly again
zuko opens the fight by spreading his arms in the direction of the two firebenders showering them with flames his adversaries block zukos attack with ease zuko shifts his weight to duck under a retaliation blast of the firebender to his left the firebender to his right jumps forward to aim a blast at zukos feet the prince propels himself out of the way he twists around in midair and directs another fire blast with his hand to the firebender that retaliated first and another with his foot to the firebender that aimed for his feet both soldiers jump out of the way of zukos flames zuko lands and stretches his fists out toward his adversaries ready to face another attack
sighs while he gets up no zuko lowers his arms and looks at his uncle power in firebending comes from the breath iroh moves his both hand up in front of him to emphasize the breathing motion not the muscles he stretches his left arm out as if he was sending a fire blast the breath becomes energy in the body the energy extends past your limbs and becomes fire iroh directs a fire blast at his nephew that evaporates just before it would scorch him get it right this time
with suppressed anger he walks toward his uncle and addresses him enough ive been drilling this sequence all day teach me the next set im more than ready
no you are impatient he sits down again on his chair you have yet to master your basics he yells his order drill it again
zuko clenches his teeth in anger he turns around and suddenly directs a power fire kick toward one of the soldiers the firebender attempts to stop the fire blast but he is unable to and is thrown on his back by its power
the suppressed anger is very apparent in his voice the sages tell us that the avatar is the last airbender closeup of iroh who does not look pleased with the attitude of his nephew he must be over a hundred years old by now hes had a century to master the four elements ill need more than basic firebending to defeat him starts to yell at his uncle you will teach me the advanced set
concedes reluctantly on a dire tone very well his expression changes completely to one of delight as he picks something up from the ground but first i must finish my roast duck he quickly munches down the roast duck much to the dismay of zuko
the scene shifts back to the southern water tribe where it pans down to reveal sokka pacing to and fro his arms behind his back
with a stern expression now men its important that you show no fear when you face a firebender he brings out his club and holds it proudly in the water tribe we fight to the last man standing for without courage how can we call ourselves men he clutches his fist to emphasize the word men as he stares down the people in front of him
the camera shifts positions to reveal that sokka is talking to six uninterested little boys
waving his hand in the air i gotta pee
angrily listen until your fathers return from the war theyre counting on you to be the men of this tribe and that means no potty breaks he makes some wide arm gestures to emphasize his words again
but i really gotta go
sighs okay who else has to go
every child immediately raises his hand sokka is surprised for a second before facepalming in frustration
runs up to sokka as the children leave in a worried tone have you seen aang grangran said he disappeared over an hour ago
aang appears from an outhouse igloo pulling his pants up a bit higher
amused wow everything freezes in there
he points toward the bathroom with a smile on his face sokkas soldiers halt beside aang and laugh with him
annoyed uh angrily points at aang katara get him out of here this lesson is for warriors only
sokka is about to walk away when he hears the sound of playing children
whee
he turns around and the picture follows his gaze to reveal the village children sliding down appas tail like a slide the end of the tail is propped upward so the children are propelled into the air they fly over sokkas spear now serving as a mark that they need to cross before landing in a soft pile of snow katara laughs as a boy lands headfirst in the snow but sokka rushes forward
yelling angrily stop stop it right now the laughter of the children is stifled immediately and appa turns his head to look at sokka who accusingly directs his anger to aang whats wrong with you we dont have time for fun and games with the war going on
sokka takes back his spear and casts an annoyed glance at the laughing children who run past him
slides down from appas head what war what are you talking about
raises one eyebrow in disbelief youre kidding right
aang looks questioningly at sokka but the expression on his face changes to enthusiasm when he catches sight of an otterpenguin
exclaims enthusiastically penguin
the animal is startled by aangs outburst and quickly waddles off aang gives chase racing past katara and sokka enhancing his speed with his airbending he leaves a deep trail in the snow as he dashes after the penguin
hes kidding right
the siblings glance at each other not sure what they need to think of aangs reaction
the scene fades away to show the otterpenguin habitat where hundreds of otterpenguins are walking or sliding down icebergs katara approaches the penguins in search for aang
aang
chasing the penguins while laughing hey come on little guy wanna go sledding he jumps at a penguin but the animal evades his attempt and aang belly flops into the snow he turns on his back and quickly erects himself with his airbending as katara comes up beside him heh heh i have a way with animals
aang stretches his arms wide and imitates the sound and movements of the animals around them making katara laugh
amused hehehe aang ill help you catch a penguin if you teach me waterbending
having grabbed the tail of a penguin he holds on as it pulls him through the snow for a short way before letting go and looking up at katara you got a deal just one little problem  he airbends himself into a sitting position im an airbender not a waterbender isnt there someone in your tribe who can teach you
sadly no youre looking at the only waterbender in the whole south pole
this isnt right a waterbender needs to master water he thinks for a moment what about the north pole theres another water tribe up there right maybe they have waterbenders who could teach you
maybe but we havent had contact with our sister tribe in a long time its not exactly turn right at the second glacier its on the other side of the world
but you forget i have a flying bison he happily points at himself appa and i can personally fly you to the north pole katara were going to find you a master
unsure thats  i mean i dont know ive never left home before
well you think about it but in the meantime can you teach me catch one of these penguins
mockingly imitating a teacher okay listen closely my young pupil inclines her head toward aang catching penguins is an ancient and sacred art she conjures a fish out of her sleeve observe
she tosses aang the fish as he catches it with an uncomprehending look on his face the penguins immediately begin crowding him he laughs as the penguins swarm over him pulling him down amidst their ranks
hi hi hi ha ha ha
the scene switches to a protruding iceberg that aang and katara use as a slide each sitting atop a penguin they soar through the air for a moment before landing on the slope and continuing their journey downward they race down and aang uses another iceberg as a ramp to propel him into the air and to soar over and past katara she in turn uses the next jump to land next to aang again the two laugh and shout out as they gleefully ride over snowy bumps
happily i havent done this since i was a kid
you still are a kid
the two ride through a tunnel of ice katara is in the lead and tries to hold aang back by constantly changing her direction when he wants to pass her aang solves this problem by increasing his speed with airbending enabling him to race over the ceiling past katara the tunnel levels out on an open plain of ice where the two get off their rides the plain itself is dominated by a large metal ship elevated and held in place by a large protrusion of ice with the bow pointing toward the sky curious aang gazes at it
in awe whoa what is that
on a slightly dark tone a fire navy ship and a very bad memory for my people aang begins to approach the wreckage aang stop were not allowed to go near it the ship could be boobytrapped
if you want to be a bender you have to let go of fear
katara ponders over that remark for a moment and walks toward aang with a scared look upon her face the two venture closer toward the ship aang helps katara to climb some of the blocks of ice that lay beside the ship and they crawl through a hole in the hull of the ship the two walk through the silent rooms of the shipwreck some white hamsters roam the otherwise deserted ship aang enters a room stocked with weapons in various places
her voice echoes through the room this ship has haunted my tribe since grangran was a little girl the camera shifts through the room revealing all the weapons more closely it was part of the fire nations first attacks
okay back up i have friends all over the world even in the fire nation aang picks up a guan dao to inspect it ive never seen any war
aang how long were you in that iceberg
uncertain i dont know a few days maybe
i think it was more like a hundred years
in full disbelief and slightly accusing what thats impossible do i look like a hundredtwelveyearold man to you
think about it the war is a century old you dont know about it because somehow you were in there the whole time aangs expression changes to one of comprehension its the only explanation
aang backs away and slumps to floor in shock
a hundred years saddened by his new discovery i cant believe it
squats beside him im sorry aang maybe somehow theres a bright side to all this

it seems ive lost my lunch box key and im hungry ooh there it is bumi points to inside the waterfall would you mind fetching it for me
the key hanging from a chain and a vertical iron ladder are dimly visible behind the waterfall aang airbends to the base of the fall and plunges into the waterfall he manages to climb up the rock face to the base of the ladder and grasp it with one hand before he can get any further the torrent of water pushes him away and out
sarcastically ooh climbing the ladder no ones ever done that before
panting aang rests a moment between two stalagmites leaps from them to the stalactites above and closer to the waterfall still high by the roof of the cavern he dives into the fall above the key and tries to grab the key as he falls with the water the rush of the water carries him past and in a moment he shoots out again keyless
thats right keep diving head in im sure itll work eventually
aang cuts a stalagmite with airbending and throws it like a spear at the key accelerating it with another air blast the stone spear snags the chain suspending the key and carries it out of the waterfall the spear pierces the stone wall above the kings balcony the key now dangling right in front of bumi
there enjoy your lunch i want my friends back now
ah not yet i need help with another matter it seems ive lost my pet flopsie
scene changes to aang in a large sunken enclosure in a new room with bumi katara and sokka up above aang finds a lopeared bunny
okay found him
bring him to me daddy wants a kiss from flopsie
come here flopsie flopsie jumps down behind aang startling both him and the bunny huh
squealing with terror the bunny bolts across the arena with aang in pursuit until it goes into a hole aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder trying to grab hold of the frightened rabbit the light dawns on his face
flopsie wait flopsie cut to bumi laughing back to aang chasing the bunny flopsie
aang puts his arm in the hole up to the shoulder trying to grab hold of the frightened rabbit the light dawns on his face the snarling goat gorilla bounds toward aang but instead of attacking picks him up and licks him
wait a minute closeup of flopsie snarling cut to behind aang flopsie
the snarling goat gorilla bounds toward aang but instead of attacking picks him up and licks him
flopsie
flopsie puts aang down and obeying a whistle from the king climbs up from the arena to him and rolls onto his back offering his belly
rubbing flopsies belly oh thats a good boy yes who has a soft belly
aang jumps up to where katara and sokka both are encased in crystal to their shoulders guys are you okay
other than the crystals slowly encasing my entire body doing great
at that moment a crystal grows on one side of sokkas body making him become unbalanced and fall aang walks over to bumi
rubbing flopsies belly oh yes
come on im ready for the next challenge
the king gives an evil laugh and the scene dissolves to an earthbending arena aang and the king are on a balcony overlooking the arena sokka and katara along with a guard are on an adjacent balcony the crystals are past their heads leaving their faces exposed
your final test is a duel and as a special treat you may choose your opponent
two toughlooking men come out standing next to the king aang looks at them uncertainly
point and choose
so  youre saying whoever i point to thats the person i get to fight
choose wisely
i  choose  you aang points to the king
wrong choice
the king straightens up and removes his outer robe proving himself to be a powerfully built old man he earthbends aang off of the balcony making him fly into the arena the king jumps down right in front of aang and laughs
you thought i was a frail old man but im the most powerful earthbender youll ever see
can i fight the guy with the axe instead
there are no takebacksies in my kingdom you might need this points to the guard standing near katara and sokka
the guard tosses aang his staff the king bends several rocks at aang who just avoids and evades the attacks
typical airbender tactic avoid and evade i hoped the avatar would be less predictable
the king attacks aang some more aang just keeps avoiding and evading
dont you have any surprises for me sooner or later youll have to strike back
aang uses his staff to helicopter into the air the king bends a large boulder into the ceiling raining rocks onto aang knocking him from the air he charges at the king on foot but a series of bending attacks leaves him flat atop a large rock pile
youll have to be a little more creative than that
aang bends an air scooter and charges forward on it throwing a huge air blast at the king as he comes the king throws up a stone barrier and the blast deflects to both sides of it
did someone leave the windows open it feels a little drafty in here are you hoping ill catch a cold
the king bends more attacks at aang leading him across half of the arena
how are you going to get me from way over there
aang charges forward on foot again using airbending to accelerate but the king softens the arena floor leaving him sunk to the waist the king bends two stones to collide on the spot but aang pops out at the top of them when they meet visibly angry now he bends the slab the king is standing on all the way to the back of the arena the king bends the largest boulder yet to come at aang from behind but he does an airassisted back flip over it the king makes more bending moves cracking the floors and walls of the arena tearing out a huge chunk of the wall and balcony they had been standing on seeing what is coming aang gasps and runs in tight circles conjuring a tornado when the king flings the huge piece at aang it is caught in the tornado and instantly whips around right back at the king the king bends it to sand before it can smash him but before he can recover aang attacks from the top of the tornado landing at the kings feet with his staff poised to strike the kings arms are raised as if surrendering but a small pebble strikes aangs head drawing his attention to the large boulder suspended over the both of them
well done avatar you fight with much fire in your heart he tosses the boulder aside and bends up to the balcony where the two siblings are almost completely encased aang joins him youve passed all my tests now you must answer one question
thats not fair you said you would release my friends if i finished your tests
oh but whats the point of tests if you dont learn anything
oh come on
answer this one question and i will set your friends free what  is my name from the looks of your friends id say you only have a few minutes
bumi walks out of frame aang confers with katara and sokka
how am i supposed to know his name
think about the challenges maybe its some kind of riddle
i got it
yeah
hes an earthbender right rocky you know because of all the rocks
were going to keep trying but that is a good backup
okay so back to the challenges i got a key from the waterfall i saved his pet and i had a duel
and what did you learn
well everything was different than i expected
the jennamite grows as she talks with anxiety and
well they werent straight forward to solve each test i had to think differently than i usually would i know his name
cut to aang confronting bumi
i solved the question the same way i solved the challenges as you said a long time ago i had to open my brain to the possibilities the king laughs with the same odd snort bumi did a hundred years ago bumi youre a mad genius
aang and bumi hug like old friends
oh aang its good to see you you havent changed a bit literally
uh over here
little help
bumi breaks the crystals using earthbending making pieces fly everywhere he catches one of them
jennamite is made of rock candy he takes a bite into the crystal delicious
so this crazy king is your old friend bumi
who are you calling old okay im old
why did you do all of this instead of just telling aang who you were
first of all its pretty fun messing with people snorts but i do have a reason aang you have a difficult task ahead the world has changed in the hundred years that youve been gone its the duty of the avatar to restore balance to the world by defeating fire lord ozai you have much to learn you must master the four elements and confront the fire lord and when you do i hope you will think like a mad genius and it looks like youre in good hands youll need your friends to help defeat the fire nation momo climbs up on aang and youll need momo too
thank you for your wisdom but before we leave i have a challenge for you
scene changes to show bumi and aang riding down the mail system cut to view of the entire city a cloud of dust is raised as a crash is heard
my cabbages
fade to credits
the scene opens up in a forest katara and aang are on a raised grassy plateau a gentle stream is running out beneath it katara is folding one of their sleeping blankets aang is lying on the root of a tree momo screeches and lands on the plateau as sokka approaches
enthusiastically great youre back
aang leaps off the root with his airbending landing beside the water tribe siblings as sokka digs in his bag
whats for dinner
digs nuts from his bag weve got a few options first round nuts and some kind of oval shaped nuts and some rockshaped nuts that might just be rocks throws the rockshaped nut toward momo dig in aang and katara look at each other then back at sokka
seriously  what else you got
momo coos and sniffs the rockshaped nut before taking it with one of his paws and slapping it against a stone twice attempting to break it he takes it with both paws and slams it down on the big rock the moment he does so however the entire earth quakes making momo shriek and his hair stand up on end
what was that
momo believing he may have caused the quake cautiously drops the rock to the ground in test the quake returns causing momo to leap away
its coming from over there
aang and katara run offcamera shouldnt we run away from huge booms not toward them
the three joined by momo hide behind a fallen tree and spy on a young boy bending boulders into the air and punching them into the side of the ravine
an earthbender
lets go meet him
he looks dangerous so we better approach cautiously
suddenly katara is a few feet in front of them excitedly addressing the earthbender hello there im katara whats your name
the young boy gasps in surprise dropping the boulder he was bending to the ground he flees quickly bringing down an avalanche of boulders with his bending to block his exit
sokka and aang approach katara yelling nice to meet you
shrugging i just wanted to say hi
hey that guys gotta be running somewhere maybe were near a village and i bet that village has a market
excitedly which means no nuts for dinner
katara and aang chase after haru hey i worked hard to get those nuts momo flies overhead chasing katara and aang yeah i hate em too slowly follows katara and aang
katara and sokka stroll through the mining villages streets while aang speaks with a shopkeeper under a terrace
great hat tries on the hat ill trade you some nuts for it

the boy enters into the dark wooden building and approaches a woman
hi mom
where have you been haru youre late get started on your chores
enters the shops front door startling haru hey youre that kid why did you run away before
uh you must have me confused with some other kid
aang and sokka enter the shop no she doesnt we saw you earthbending
haru and his mother gasps in horror at his secret being revealed and both the door and window to the small shop are promptly slammed shut
standing by the window they saw you doing what
theyre crazy mom i mean look at how theyre dressed
aang gazes to his conical hat shifting it about in confusion katara awkwardly grasps at her dress looking with astonishment at herself sokka quirks an eyebrow and smooths out his sleeve
you know how dangerous that is you know what would happen if they caught you earthbending
heavy knocks on the door open up
sokka peeks through the windows blinds fire nation act natural
harus mother opens the door allowing the fire nation tax collector to walk inside he stares awkwardly at the four children in front of him haru grasps his chin and stares toward katara crosseyed sokka eyeballs an apple katara hunches forward with her eyes wide open having stuffed her mouth with berries aang has his hand atop a barrel beaming an immense toothy smile his pose is shortlived as the barrels lid spins dunking aangs hand into the barrel of water and causes him to fall down
the tax collector stares sourly toward the four children aggressively what do you want ive already paid you this week
the tax just doubled arrogantly and we wouldnt want an accident now would we creates a ball of fire between his hands making everyone slightly back away fire is sometimes so hard to control
harus mother and the tax collector approach the stores counter where she opens a small chest and passes a meager handful of earth kingdom currency to the tax collector haru leans against the counter staring with contempt toward the fire nation man
you can keep the copper ones walks away dropping four copper pieces to the floor exits
door slams nice guy how long has the fire nation been here
five years fire lord ozai uses our towns coal mines to fuel his ships
theyre thugs they steal from us and everyone heres too much of a coward to do anything about it
angered quiet haru dont talk like that
curiously but harus an earthbender he can help
earthbending is forbidden its caused nothing but misery for this village casts a meaningful glance toward her son he must never use his abilities
how can you say that haru has a gift asking him not to earthbend is like asking me not to waterbend its a part of who we are
shakes head in dismay you dont understand
i understand that haru can help you fight back what can the fire nation do to you that they havent done already
they could take haru away like they took his father
scene changes to late evening viewing farmland and a barn appa walks into the barn cut to a closer view of sokka katara haru and aang standing inside the barn
my mom said you can sleep here tonight but you should leave in the morning
thanks ill make sure appa doesnt eat all your hay
appa engulfs a mouthful of hay appa pauses turning to stare dubiously toward aang before continuing to chew hay the scene switches to katara and haru taking a walk into the woods outside under the setting sun
im sorry about what i said earlier i didnt know about your father
thats okay its funny the way you were talking back in the store it reminded me of him
flattered thanks
my father was very courageous when the fire nation invaded he and the other earthbenders were outnumbered ten to one but they fought back anyway
he sounds like a great man
the two approach the top of a steep cliff gazing out to the setting sun beyond
stops after the attack they rounded up my father and every other earthbender and took them away kneels we havent seen them since
so thats why you hide your earthbending
yeah problem is  closeup earthbends two stones in a circle above his hand the only way i can feel close to my father now crushes the stones to sand with his hands the sand blows away is when i practice my bending he taught me everything i know
sits beside haru sets her fingertips on her necklace see this necklace my mother gave it to me
its beautiful
i lost my mother in a fire nation raid hangs her head turning away this necklace is all i have left of her
its not enough is it
no hangs her head and turns away
the scene switches to katara and haru who have continued their walk along the dirt trail a loud boom sounds and rock and dust blasts from a distant mine entrance an old man cries out
help help
the mine
katara and haru run quickly to the entrance which has caved in and left a tremendous pile of rocks pinning the old man to the ground on his stomach sand continues to pour down rocks intermittently falling
help me
haru braces his back against the mine entrance katara pulls the old man ugh its not working we have to get help
theres no time pull harder
getting an idea haru theres a way you can help him
guilty fear i cant
please theres no one around to see you its the only way
haru leaps away from the falling debris spinning back to face it as he assumes an earthbending form with a sudden and strong move he blasts all the rocks down the tunnel freeing the old man
excitedly haru you did it the two take place beside the old man and aid him walking away from the mine
at the barn katara is sitting up in her bedroll with a lamp in her lap sokka is lying on a square bale of hay with his blanket over him and aang is sprawled out on appas head with momo lying on his back
it was so brave of haru to use his earthbending to help that old man
you must have really inspired him
i guess so
everyone should get some sleep were leaving at dawn
unhappily dawn cant we sleep in for once
commandingly absolutely not this village is crawling with fire nation troops if they discover youre here aang well be eating fireballs for breakfast goodnight
slyly with a wry smirk id rather eat fireballs than nuts
with finality goodnight
katara and aang share a few playful chuckles with each other before she blows out the lamplight to get some rest
fire nation troops march on a mission through the dead of night the man in the lead raps on a wooden door haru answers the door suddenly gasping in shock as he sees the troops
points accusingly thats him thats the earthbender
the fire nation leader shoves the old man out of the way and approaches haru haru screams as the man forces haru into his grip and hauls him away
in the morning katara carries a jar outside of the barn she sets it down beside a water pump and proceeds to waterbend drawing water out of the spigot and into the waiting pot picking it up she spots harus mother standing with her back to her gazing toward the distant ocean harus mother slowly turns around laying a tearful gaze upon katara katara realizes haru has been taken and drops the pot as it shatters to pieces at her feet
enters barn to see aang and sokka folding blankets emotionally they took him they took haru away
surprised what
hurriedly the old man turned him in to the fire nation  its all my fault  i forced him into earthbending
steps beside her taking her hand in his and laying his other hand supportively behind her shoulder slow down katara when did this happen
harus mother said they came for him at midnight
then its too late to track him hes long gone
turns defiantly to the open door clenches fists we dont need to track him the fire nation is going to take me right to haru
confused and  why would they do that
determined because theyre going to arrest me for earthbending aang and sokka share a horrified look
scene changes to sokka and katara working together to push a boulder overtop an air vent on a rocky road
i thought you were crazy at first katara but this might work there are ventilation shafts throughout these mines all aang has to do is send an air current from that vent to this one right here the boulder levitates and tada fake earthbending
props hands off hips turns to aang aang did you get all that
snapping small puffs of air at a sooty copper fritillary butterfly dismissively sure sure i got it
do you remember your cue
continues snapping puffs of air still dismissive yeah yeah just relax youre taking all the fun out of this
aggravated by this do you mean intentionally being captured by a group of ruthless firebenders
humored exactly thats fun stuff
group of firebenders with spears approach here they come get in your places
aang stops playing with the butterfly and momo tries catching it as it flies away as the group of spearwielding guards approach katara and sokka make a show of walking into one another by their stomachs before emphatically shouting
while angrily pointing at katara get out of my way pipsqueak the soldiers watch in confusion one of them even raises an eyebrow
angrily hunched over how dare you call me pipsqueak you gianteared cretin
just as angrily hunched over what did you call me
far too dramatically as her hair loopies move with her motion a gianteared cretin look at those things do herds of animals use them for shade imitates an elephants ears
towers over his sister you better back off slips his hand by his mouth and mutters seriously back off
more determined heightens above her nowcowering brother i will not back off i bet elephants get together and make fun of how large your ears are
thats it youre going down
ill show you whos boss angrily points at sokka earthbending style overdramatically leaps toward the boulder clenching her fist upward to which there is no reaction angrily i said earthbending style
at kataras shout aang gasps quietly as he realizes his mistake by missing his cue the young airbender ceases playing with the butterfly leaps up and blasts a strong jet of air into the ventilation duct suddenly sending the boulder levitating into the air this reveals momo behind the boulder who has his arms raised licking himself
points a finger to the lemur surprised that lemur hes earthbending
katara and momo each remain in their positions katara eyes the man in surprise sokka angrily waves his arms toward her no you idiot its the girl
oh blushes shamefully of course
sokka steps beside katara laying his hands on her shoulders as the boulder falls to the ground katara stands patiently
ill hold her closeup whispers to katara youve got twelve hours to find haru well be right behind you
the guards escort katara away leaving aang sokka and momo to watch as she takes a final glance back sokka unhappily tugs at his ears testing their sizes
eyeballs momo perched off of aangs shoulder points accusingly momo you have some big ears momo folds his ears back hunches down and coos in protest
katara is in the back of a fire nation transport with other earthbender prisoners she wears a brown tattered prison garb over her blue water tribe outfit and stares glumly downward sokka and aang each have conical yellow hats in a crowd attempting to stealthily observe her travel katara looks longingly over shoulder as the cart bobs along a pier heading toward a waiting barge on the ocean
aang and sokka chase the barge riding appa through the clouds the immense smoking offshore fire nation prison rig is seen just ahead closeup of the rig
aang stares nervously at the barge carrying katara to the prison shell be fine aang katara knows what shes doing
after the barge arrives six prisoners including katara line up on the deck of the prison spearwielding guards stand at either side a prison warden approaches
smugly earthbenders it is my pleasure to welcome you aboard my modest shipyard i am your warden i prefer to think of you not as prisoners quips smartly but as honored guests and i hope you come to think of me as your humble and caring host paces nonchalantly you will succeed here if you simply abide
the warden pauses suddenly interrupted by a prisoner in line coughing with no forewarning the warden leaps into the air and aims a blast of fire at the prisoners legs in anger the prisoner cowers away for safety as the warden stands defiantly toward the man
very angrily what kind of guest dishonors his host by interrupting him take him below swings his arms some guards escort the man away mutters one week in solitary will improve his manners continues smug gait simply treat me with the courtesy that i give you
approaches katara kneeling to stare into her obstinate expression she crosses her eyebrows scowling coarsely at the man
and well get along famously
the prisoners are taken on a tour of the facility below fellow prisoners are seen laboring
you will notice earthbenders that this rig is made entirely of metal you are miles away from any rock or earth katara pauses glancing over the expansive ocean to the land far away so if you have any illusions about employing that brutish savagery that passes for bending among you people  lowly forget them it is impossible good day
a guard escorts the prisoners into the prison courtyard katara enters last and the metal gates close behind her among many earthbender prisoners haru takes notice of katara above the courtyard a watchman and the warden monitor the scene
surprised katara
excitedly runs and hugs haru haru
confused what are you doing here
somewhat apologetically its my fault you were captured i came to rescue you
shocked so you got yourself arrested
it was the only way to find you
youve got guts katara ill give you that places hand on her shoulder come on theres someone i want you to meet
the two approach an old graybearded man eating dinner among other prisoners
katara this is my father tyro the older man looks up dad this is katara
slightly bows its an honor to meet you
hands katara a bowl have some dinner katara katara accepts the bowl but grimaces its not as bad as it looks katara tries a spoonful but becomes further disgusted he finds humor in this with a small chuckle its still pretty bad though
walks up and lays a hand on tyros shoulder tyro the prisoners are complaining there arent enough blankets to go around
ill talk to the guards in the meantime make sure the elderly are taken care of the rest of us will simply have to hope for warmer weather
if you dont mind me asking whats your escape plan
excuse me
you know the plan to get everyone off the rig what is it mutiny sabotage
the plan the plan is to survive wait out this war hope that one day some of us can get back home and forget this ever happened
shocked how can you say that you sound like youve already given up
katara i admire your courage and i envy your youth but peoples lives are at stake here the warden is a ruthless man and he wont stand for any rebellion im sorry but were powerless
obstinately well see about that
katara stands up and carries a trash can lid and a ladle climbing on top of a wooden table from there she bangs the ladle against the lid to draw attention
earthbenders you dont know me but i know of you every child in my water tribe village was rocked to sleep with stories of the brave earth kingdom and the courageous earthbenders who guard its borders the watchman walks up to talk the warden but the warden stops him and listens some of you may think that the fire nation has made you powerless yes they have taken away your ability to bend but they cant take away your courage and it is your courage they should truly fear because it runs deeper than any mine youve been forced to dig any ocean that keeps you far from home it is the strength of your hearts that make you who you are hearts that will remain unbroken when all rock and stone has eroded away the time to fight back is now i can tell you the avatar has returned so remember your courage earthbenders shouts clearly let us fight for our freedom
kataras speech is met with utter silence and a small cough in the background leaving her to fall into sorrow as she realizes the muted answer she receives the warden walks away from the courtyard later that night while she is sleeping aang sneaks into the prison and taps his hand to her shoulder waking her urging her to be quiet he leads her to the perimeter where sokka and appa are waiting to make their escape
your twelve hours are up wheres haru weve gotta get outta here
i cant
hurriedly we dont have much time there are guards everywhere get on
concerned katara whats wrong
im not leaving aang and sokka share a questionable look im not giving up on these people
fade to black cut to sokka aang and katara on the metal perimeter
what do you mean youre not leaving
we cant abandon these people there has to be a way to help them
maybe shes right what do you say sokka
i say youre both crazy the trio ducks a searching spotlight last chance we need to leave now
sternly no
shakes his head dismally i hate when you get like this come on we better hide
katara and sokka flee aang whispers to appa before joining them go hide
appa soars overhead to fly away and hide look
the two guards who witnessed appa take to the skies approach the warden on a catwalk
tell me exactly what you saw
well sir it looked like a flying bison
surprised what
it was a giant flying buffalo sir with an empty saddle
which was it a buffalo or a bison
uh im not sure what the difference is but thats not really the point is it sir
furiously ill decide what the point is fool
the warden throws the first guard overboard the man screams in horror before finally being silenced by a splash below
to the second guard as he straightens up you wake up the captain search the entire rig turns to walk away
uh sir
annoyed what
somewhat timidly that was  the captain you just threw overboard so 
still quite annoyed then wake up someone i havent thrown overboard and search the rig theres something going on here and i dont like it
cut scene momo peeps over a wooden crate where the trio is safely hiding behind numerous boxes scene opens up to show the three huddled together seated on the metal ground in the darkness
we dont have much time what are we gonna do
i wish i knew how to make a hurricane
both sokka and katara provide aang with assuredly unentertained facial expressions
the warden would run away and wed steal his keys
wouldnt he just take his keys with him
im just tossing ideas around
i tried talking the earthbenders into fighting back but it didnt work if there was just a way to help them help themselves
for that theyd need some kind of earth or some rock something they can bend
lays her palm to the surface but this entire place is made of metal
no its not points to smokestacks look at the smoke i bet theyre burning coal in other words earth
morning arrives the scene gaining light sokka and katara are alone by an air duct sokka is peering down into it while katara kneels beside it with her hands on its rim
its almost dawn were running out of time you sure this is gonna work
it should these vents reminded me of our little trick back at the village were gonna do the same thing but on a much bigger scale the camera zooms through a visual walkthrough of sokkas explanation theres a huge deposit of coal at the base of the silo and the whole system is ventilated aang closed off all the vents except one when he does his airbending the coal only has one place to go right back here
theres the intruder
the two siblings are suddenly surrounded by a number of spearwielding fire nation guards the prisoners have gathered a safe distance away from this spectacle observing what is happening
stay back im warning you pulls out his boomerang turning backtoback with his sister
roughly katara stop you cant win this fight
listen to him well child youre one mistake away from dying where you stand
a sudden rush of air fills their ears as the facility shakes the ventilation shaft bursts off its hinges as an immense blast of coal soars into the air crashing down into a gathered pile everyone present is silent staring in stark surprise at this turn of events lastly aang leaps out from the barren ventilation shaft landing atop the coal pile and coughing covered in soot and dirt momo follows him and katara runs up to the coal turning to face the earthbenders
lifting up a piece of coal heres your chance earthbenders take it your fate is in your own hands
haru bolts ahead without hesitation prepared to bend the waiting coal as a weapon tyro throws his hand up bracing his sons chest to halt his advance
bursts out into highly amused laughter foolish girl you thought a few inspirational words and some coal would change these people look at these blank hopeless faces their spirits were broken a long time ago kataras expression dims as she does as instructed staring at the forlorn prisoners oh but you still believe in them how sweet theyre a waste of your energy little girl you failed
the warden finishes his speech by turning to take leave of the facility as he does so a single piece of coal sails through the air and pelts the back of his head outraged the warden spins back to see who dared to attack him haru stands defiantly levitating three pieces of coal above his hand the warden sends a blast of fire toward haru but the fire is blocked as tyro raises a wall of coal in his defense
guards line up and prepare for battle show no mercy the guards send a blast of fire as one toward the rebelling prisoners
the earthbenders work together to haul a sizable mass of coal to block the fire for the earth kingdom attack
slamming the coal to the ground chunks of rock assault the guards the battle immediately flares prisoners ducking blasts of fire and countering with fists of coal katara and aang chase after sokka as he snaps soldiers spears in two with his boomerang tossing the broken shafts to momo overhead momo continues to collect other pieces of broken spears that are thrown up to him
tyro and haru work in unison to compress gathered coal into one lump slinging this through the doors to make way for their escape the guards on top fall down
get to the ships well hold them off
do not let them escape
generates an air funnel and holds it between his hands to katara and sokka guys throw me some coal
katara and sokka drop heaps of coal into his funnel firing the material rapidly at the warden and his fellow benders knocking them to the ground following this tyro and two other earthbenders work together to lift coal beneath these adversaries moving them away from the rig and over the ocean
pleading no please i cant swim
dont worry i hear cowards float drops their enemies into the ocean
on the barge headed to their homes haru and tyro approach katara on its deck
i want to thank you for saving me for saving us
turning to face haru denying all it took was a little coal
it wasnt the coal katara it was you katara blushes
thank you for helping me find my courage katara of the water tribe my family and everyone here owes you much
so i guess youre going home now
yes to take back my village raises his voice to the crowd on the lower deck to take back all of our villages the fire nation will regret the day they set foot on our land crowd cheers at tyros bravado
to katara come with us
i cant your mission is to take back your home ours is to get aang to the north pole gazes over the rail to see momo join aang atop appas head floating in the ocean
thats him isnt it the avatar aang airbends an encased piece of coal momo jumps into his lap katara thank you for bringing my father back to me i never thought id see him again i only wish there was some way 
i know reaches for her necklace wistfully but realizes it is not around her neck and panics my mothers necklace its gone
back on the prison rig zuko stands alone facing the sunset amid coal lying sparsely on the deck he seizes kataras necklace in his fingers lifting it to stare at it grimly
fade to credits
the episode opens to a cloudy sky looking toward the ground the point of view switches to one above the clouds as they pass by a messenger hawk floats into view emitting a cry when appa overshadows the bear and roars it shrieks again and stoops down swiveling out of view the camera shifts to a sideview of appa soaring along with aang katara and sokka in his saddle
voiceover somewhat dreamily those clouds look so soft cut to aang sitting lazily atop appas head a twig in his mouth the view pans to the left showing sokka carving something with an uninterested look on his face katara lying on her stomach popped up on her elbows staring dreamingly over the rim of appas saddle and momo sleeping on the luggage dont they like you could just jump down and youd land in a big soft cottony heap
turns to katara mockingly with a smile maybe you should give it a try
looks at sokka with annoyance sarcastically as she looks away from him youre hilarious
frontal shot excitedly ill try it carrying his staff he jumps off appa with a big smile on his face as he begins to fall he turns once around his axis winking at the camera as he passes he falls down spreadeagled laughing joyously yeah
cut to a sideview of appas saddle as katara and sokka pop their heads over the rim looking down in the direction aang went cut to an upward looking shot following aang falling down still smiling broadly as he passes the camera it tilts down following him as he vanishes in a cloud cut back to the siblings katara looks somewhat worried while sokka gazes wideeyed at the point where aang vanished when he leans over to search the sky aang comes back up from behind them on his glider the siblings turn around as they hear the snapping noise of aangs glider being closed and they watch how the airbender plops down on the saddle his legs spread apart and a big smile on his face cut to a sideview of an unimpressed looking sokka before switching back to a frontal shot of aang who is dripping wet
looking at himself turns out clouds are made of water
he breaths in deeply and slams his balled right fist against his stretched left hand creating an expanding air ball around him in the process drying himself off as aang leans back to rest on both his hands he contently looks at momo whose fur got all fluffed by aangs airbending cut to a sideview of sokka who is still looking at aang unimpressed katara glances at her brother but her attention is drawn to something over his shoulder
hey what is that
sokka looks over his right shoulder in the direction katara is looking as well katara gets up and walks to the front of appas saddle cut to a shot of the landscape in front of them a large dark patch of burned land standing out among the lush green of the forest cut to a frontal view of the trio now all looking over the front rim of appas saddle surprised looks on their faces
camera zooms in its like a scar 
the scene fades to a ground view of the scorched forest the camera pans to the right showing many burned trees and team avatar standing in the middle of a gray barren patch
voiceover listen cut to a frontal shot of a sadlooking aang his friends behind him its so quiet theres no life anywhere
aang are you okay
noticing footprints angrily fire nation those evil savages make me sick they have no respect for 
shhh
whispering angrily what im not allowed to be angry
katara points to aang with a somewhat concerned look on her face as he slumps over downcast at the sight
kneels down and sighs he picks up some ash as it slowly seeps through his hand and drops to the ground sadly why would anyone do this how could i let this happen
aang you didnt let this happen it has nothing to do with you
sadly yes it does its the avatars job to protect nature but i dont know how to do my job
thats why were going to the north pole smiling softly to find you a teacher
yeah a waterbending teacher but theres no one who can teach me how to be the avatar monk gyatso said that avatar roku would help me
the avatar before you he died over a hundred years ago how are you supposed to talk to him
i dont know momo comes up to aang and settles in his lap
in another area zuko comes looking for iroh
uncle its time to leave where are you uncle iroh
relaxing in a hot spring over here
uncle we need to move on were closing in on the avatars trail and i dont want to lose him
you look tired prince zuko why dont you join me in these hot springs and soak away your troubles
my troubles cannot be soaked away its time to go
you should take your teachers advice and relax a little the temperatures just right i heated it myself he breathes steam through his nose
enough we need to leave now get out of the water
very well he gets up exposing himself
shielding his eyes on second thought why dont you take another few minutes but be back at the ship in a halfhour or im leaving without you
iroh sighs as he slumps back into the water
the scene returns to the forest
approaches aang hey aang you ready to be cheered up
sadly no an acorn is thrown at him ow hey how is that cheering me up
chuckles cheered me up an acorn gets thrown at him ow yeah i probably deserved that
these acorns are everywhere aang that means the forest will grow back every one of these will be a tall oak tree someday and all the birds and animals that lived here will come back she places the acorn in his hand and closes it
thanks katara
katara smiles at him before gasping at the sight of an old man approaching
hey who are you
when i saw the flying bison i thought it was impossible approaches aang but those markings  are you the avatar child aang look to katara who nods he nods himself my village desperately needs your help
the scene cuts to them at senlin village at sunset the village has been partially destroyed the wanderer leads them into the center building
this young person is the avatar
so the rumors of your return are true it is the greatest honor of a lifetime to be in your presence
nice to meet you too so  is there something i can help you with
im not sure 
our village is in crisis hes our only hope to aang for the last few days at sunset a spirit monster comes and attacks our village he is hei bai the black and white spirit
why is it attacking you
we do not know but each of the last three nights he has abducted one of our own we are especially fearful because the winter solstice draws near
what happens then
as the solstice approaches the natural world and the spirit world grow closer and closer until the line between them is blurred completely
hei bai is already causing devastation and destruction once the solstice is here theres no telling what will happen
so what do you want me to do exactly
who better to resolve a crisis between our world and the spirit world than the avatar himself you are the great bridge between man and spirits
right  thats me
hey great bridge guy could i talk to you over here for a second she leads him toward a window aang you seem a little unsure about all of this
yeah that might be because i dont know anything at all about the spirit world its not like theres someone to teach me this stuff
so  can you help these people
i have to try dont i maybe whatever i have to do will just  come to me momo lands on his shoulder
with a kind and reassuring smile i think you can do it aang
with a similar expression yeah brief pause were all going to get eaten by a spirit monster
cut back to the hot spring a sleeping iroh is awoken by nearby stirring in the trees
whos there he sees a ratlike animal a meadow vole i should have known he takes the creature into the palm of his hand you startled me little one sighs it seems i dozed off and missed my nephews deadline but it was a very sweet nap
the meadow vole leaps up and down this is followed by shaking and the ground moving toward iroh suddenly the rock at the bottom of the spring jumps up capturing him three earth kingdom soldiers surround him
picks up irohs clothes hes a fire nation soldier
hes no ordinary soldier this is the fire lords brother the dragon of the west the oncegreat general iroh but now hes our prisoner
iroh gives the captain a stern look
cut back to senlin near sunset aang steps outside the center building and awaits the hei bai
walking toward the village entrance hello spirit can you hear me this is the avatar speaking im here to try to help stuff
cut to the building interior sokka and katara watch
this isnt right we cant sit here and cower while aang waits for some monster to show up
if anyone can save us he can
he still shouldnt have to face this alone
the sun sets and night falls cut back to aang
the sun has set where are you hei bai well  spirit  uhhh  i hereby ask you to please leave this village in peace he spins his staff and sticks it down in apparent authority okay  well  i guess thats settled then
he walks away behind him however the hei bai fades into the real world he walks right behind aang who turns to see him
you must be the hei bai spirit my name is
the spirit releases a burst of energy at him it moves past him
my names aang im the avatar and i would like to help hey wait up hei bai wreaks havoc smashing buildings and destroying a tower with energy uhhh
the avatars methods are  unusual
it doesnt seem too interested in what hes saying maybe we should go help him
no only the avatar stands a chance against the hei bai
aang will figure out the right thing to do sokka
hei bai smashes another building
please would you stop destroying things and listen im trying to do my job as spirit bridge excuse me would please turn around i command you to turn around now
the spirit hits aang and sends him flying to the roof of another building
thats it he needs help exits the building
sokka wait starts to follow him
stops her its not safe
hei bai over here he throws his boomerang at him but it barely affects the monster he runs toward it
sokka go back
well fight him together aang
i dont want to fight him unless i sokka is taken by the hei bai and the spirit flees aang chases it
running to the village entrance sokka the villagers go the entrance as well katara is left standing fearful
back near the hot spring two soldiers and zuko look for iroh
uncle uncle where are you
sir maybe he thought you left without him
somethings not right here that pile of rocks
it looks like theres been a landslide sir
land doesnt slide uphill those rocks didnt move naturally stands up straight my uncles been captured by earthbenders
back to the forest aang continues to pursue the hei bai looking for sokka
aang over here help
hang on sokka
aang pulls out his hand trying to free sokka however before he can grab him the spirit fades away taking sokka with it aang falls in front of a bearlike statue knocked out
a couple of hours later aang awakens
sokka he realizes sokka is nowhere to be seen i failed
the next scene cuts back to the soldiers who captured iroh they are riding ostrich horses one soldier carries a torch with him for light
where are you taking me
were taking you to face justice
right but where specifically
a place youre quite familiar with actually you once laid siege to it for 600 days but it would not yield to you
ah the great city of ba sing se
it was greater than you were apparently
i acknowledge my defeat at ba sing se after 600 days away from home my men were tired and i was tired yawns and im still tired he falls off one of the horses he is quickly picked back up however he leaves one of his sandals behind and smiles cleverly
cut back to senlin village katara awaits at the village entrance for sokka and aang the old wanderer approaches her
im sure theyll be back
i know
places a blanket around her you should get some rest
everythings going to be okay 
your brother is in good hands i would be shocked if the avatar returned without him as he is speaking aang approaches
katara katara i lost him
the sun rises
the sun is rising perhaps he will return soon
his appearance is blue what no im right here he waves his hand in the wanderers face only to notice his own appearance im in the spirit world
cut back to the forest zuko comes up on irohs sandal
sniffs and gets a disgusted look yeah thats uncle iroh he remounts his rhino
back at the village
ill figure this out katara i promise like they said im the bridge between the worlds right all i have to do is  figure out what i have to do but once i do that no problem appa approaches appa hey buddy im right here he breathes on katara but i guess you cant see me either
its okay appa dont worry im sure theyre on their way back i bet they even found you a bunch of moon peaches for a treat the two return the village
what am i supposed to do avatar roku how can i talk to you he hears something sokka he notices a dragon coming toward him thats definitely not sokka he tries to fly away but cannot he notices his airbending is not working at all what i cant airbend in the spirit world the dragon lands just before him you dont know where sokka is do you the dragon touches him he sees a vision of roku flying on this dragon youre avatar rokus animal guide like appa is to me i need to save my friend and i dont know how is there some way for me to talk to roku the dragon curls around him and he gets on him ill be back katara it gets up take me to roku the dragon flies away
cut to a mountain the earthbenders are leading iroh through iroh looks at the skies and notices the dragon and aang he gasps in wonder
whats the problem
nothing pauses actually there is a bit of a problem my old joints are sore and aching and these shackles are too loose
too loose
thats right the cuffs move and jangle around and bump my wrists it would help me if you tighten them so they wouldnt shake around so much
very well corporal tighten the prisoners handcuffs
they all stop the corporal dismounts and moves to iroh as he touches his handcuffs iroh breathes deeply and heats them up he pushes the corporals hand to the cuffs causing him to scream in pain iroh jumps free and blasts fire at the soldiers he rolls down the hill as the soldiers try to get control of their ostrich horses
cut back to aang and fang fang takes him to a temple on an unknown island he flies into the temple and toward the roof
hey what are you doing he screams but they fly right through the roof and into a mysterious room within is a celestial calendar and a statue of roku i dont understand this is just a statue of roku fang presses one of his feelers to aangs forehead a vision of a comet appears to him is that what roku wants to talk to me about a comet when can i talk to him fang moves his head allowing a light beam to appear this is just to the right of rokus statue with another feeler press he sees a vision of the sun setting and rising repeatedly and the light closing in on roku its a calendar and the light will reach roku on the solstice so thats when ill be able to speak to roku the dragon breathes an apparent yes but i cant wait that long i need to save sokka now the dragon takes aang from the temple
cut back to iroh rolling down the hill one of the soldiers hits him with a rockslide all of the soldiers chase after him reaching him at the bottom of the hill
hes too dangerous captain we just cant just carry him to the capital we have to do something now
i agree he must be dealt with immediately and severely
iroh spits a rock out
meanwhile katara is flying on appa over the forest
its no use appa i dont seem them anywhere our best hope is to go back to the village and wait she redirects appa to the villages direction
while following the ostrich horse footprints zuko notices appa
the avatar he turns slightly but looks back at the footprints
fang takes aang back to the statue at fast speed aang notices his body is there and also prepares for impact suddenly fang disappears into the statue and aang is returned to his body he looks around at the statue opens his glider and flies back to the village
cut to the village sunset katara stands outside the center building and notices aangs return aang lands and katara runs to him
youre back she embraces aang wheres sokka
im not sure 
the evening gives way to night 
back to iroh who is surrounded by the soldiers
these dangerous hands must be crushed he brings up and prepares to drop it however zuko jumps in and kicks the rock away before breaking irohs chain with his boot
excellent form prince zuko
you taught me well
surrender yourselves its five against two youre clearly outnumbered
yeah thats true but you are clearly outmatched
the solders fire rocks but iroh destroys them with the chains zuko takes out two soldiers with fire a rock is fired at him but iroh catches it and throws it back at the soldiers knocking them down the captain fires three rocks at zuko which he dodges zuko counters with fire blasts that are dodged the captain brings up a large mass of rock however iroh throws his chains around his ankles knocking him and causing the rocks to fall on top of him the soldiers are heard groaning underneath the rocks
now would you please put on some clothes
cut back to senlin aang awaits at the entrance for the hei bai after some time he gives up and returns to the center building just as he exits however the spirit appears to his left he throws up an air shield to stop its attack
aang what are you doing run
the spirit prepares to resume its attack when aang jumps in front of it he feels its forehead and notices that a panda lurks below it
youre the spirit of this forest now i understand youre upset and angry because your home was burned down when i saw the forest had burned i was sad and upset but my friend gave me hope that the forest would grow back he shows it the acorn and leaves it at his feet the spirit picks it up and reverts to the panda form it walks away peacefully as it exits a series of branches grow and three villagers and sokka emerge from it
sokka she runs to him and embraces him while other villagers embrace their loved ones
what happened
you were trapped in the spirit world for 24 hours how are you feeling
like i seriously need to use the bathroom katara gives sokka a somewhat disgusted look
thank you avatar if only there were a way to repay you for what youve done
you could give us some supplies and some money
sokka
what we need stuff
it would be an honor to help you prepare for your journey
im so proud of you aang you figured out what to do all on your own
actually i did have a little help and theres something else
what is it
i need to talk to roku and i think i found a way to contact his spirit
thats great
creepy but great
theres a temple on a crescentshaped island and if i go there on the solstice ill be able to speak with him
but the solstice is tomorrow
yeah and theres one more problem the island is in the fire nation
the siblings grow fearful the shot slowly moves up to the moon over the hills
fade to credits

aang airbends himself atop appas head close shot of him looking back with a sad expression on his face as he prepares to leave as appa stands up the shot changes to a frontal view and katara and sokka run to stand before the bison preventing him from moving any further

yeah but theres just one little problem
closeup eyes widening a blockade
birdseye view of a tworow line of fire nation ships stretching across the ocean as far as the eye can see brief glimpse of numerous fire nation catapults prepared to fire

theres no time
this is exactly why i didnt want you to come its too dangerous
and thats exactly why were here
boldly lets run this blockade both katara and sokka grin confidently
appa yipyip appa roars readily sailing forward even quicker

appa are you okay appa roars a reply they soar higher into the clouds
on the ocean surface zukos ship is narrowly missing many falling fireballs sheets of ocean water crash over the ship and crew members run for safety a single fireball explodes on the aft side of the vessel

cries out desperately sokka whips the reins down and begins a speedy descent in chase of sokka
appa reaches sokka just in time katara grabs his hand pulling him back into saddle appa skims the ocean surface a fish appears out of nowhere and slaps sokka square in the face knocking him into the saddle momo leaps up and grabs the fish as appa continues his swift flight mere feet above the ocean fireballs crash into the water all around them

ecstatic we made it
katara and sokka each grimacing in terror we got into the fire nation meekly great
where do you think the avatar is headed sir
im not sure turns aside gazes at zukos smoking ship but i bet a certain banished prince will know
scene switch to just overhead zukos ship his small vessel approaches two ships in the blockade these two ships sail opposite directions in a moment they will close off zukos ships path

confidently we can make it
captain stands ahead of a squad of nine firebenders the boarding party is ready to apprehend prince zuko sir
swiftly wait cut the engines and let them pass
sir
each ship in the blockade halts allowing zukos ship to glide by beneath their deck untouched zhao stands high sharing an interlocked gaze with the banished prince below zuko and iroh look behind them in silence as they sail safely through iroh strokes his gray beard curiously
the scene cuts back to appa flying among blue skies sokka and katara sit up in the saddle while aang sits on appas head
the scene changes to sokka slumped in the back of the saddle katara is leaning her arms over the front of the saddle and aang is lounging against appas neck
the sky has changed to a darker sunsetfilled evening appa is visibly tired aang is sprawled over appas head with momo equally sprawled over aangs head katara and sokka have each collapsed into the saddle
closeup momo is shown bouncing about in eager surprise there it is sokka and katara pop up in the saddle the island where rokus dragon took me full view of crescent island and its smoking volcano as appa descends

scene cut to katara sokka aang and momo walking along the stone bridge to approach a multistory fire temple
closeup toptobottom view of the fire temple i dont see any guards
camera drops to show the group taking cover behind a lower wall below steps the fire nation must have abandoned the temple when avatar roku died
its almost sundown we better hurry the group leaps over the wall and charges for the front door
the group tiptoes through an enormous chamber with firedecor columns wait i think i heard something
turning around they see five men standing in the hallway dressed in red with tall hats we are the fire sages guardians of the temple of the avatar
great i am the avatar
we know inhales briskly before punching a blast of fire their direction
deflects three balls of fire with his airbending closeup shouts over his shoulder ill hold them off run
aang leaps forward and spins his leg across the ground sending a low air blade that sweeps the fire sages legs out from beneath them and they all fall to the ground aang flees after his friends
if the avatar contacts roku theres no telling how powerful the boy will become split up and find him
hallway view aang skids in front of katara and sokka and continues running follow me
do you know where youre going the two follow aang
rounds a corner and disappears from sight nope a moment passes katara and sokka stop when aang skids into view again fearfully wrong way runs past them
rounds the corner frightening sokka and katara to chase after aang come back
the trio turns another corner and charges down the hallway however they reach a deadend as aang skids to an immediate halt turning around they face shyu who raises a hand in peace
i dont want to fight you i am a friend
firebenders arent our friends aang steps ahead of his friends assuming an airbending posture
steps toward the avatar before dropping to his knees and pressing his palms to the floor in submission this startles aang katara and sokka i know why youre here avatar
surprised you do
yes rises from the floor to stand again you wish to speak to avatar roku i can take you to him
skeptically how
slides back a lamplight on the wall places palm on wall focuses firebending into this location to open a secret passage this way
echoes in the distance find him
briefly glances down the hall time is running out quickly
aang and katara exchange a look with one another asserting each others belief to trust this firebender the group enters the passage and descends the steps into the cave shyu enters behind them and closes the passageway
closeup tightens knuckles on ships railing smoke billows behind his ship whats he up to uncle why didnt commander zhao arrest me
because he wants to follow you he knows youll lead him to the prize youre both after the avatar
closeup if zhao wants to follow a trail of smoke then thats exactly what ill let him do
brief scene cut to show the sun nearly setting far overhead view of shyu leading the group through caverns avatar roku once called this temple his home he formed these secret passages out of the magma
did you know avatar roku
no but my grandfather knew him many generations of fire sages guarded this fire temple long before me we all have a strong spiritual connection to this place
is that how you knew i was coming
a few weeks ago an amazing thing occurred the statue of avatar roku its eyes began to glow
thats when we were at the air temple avatar rokus eyes were glowing there too
at that moment we knew you had returned to the world
if this is the avatars temple why did the sages attack me
things have changed in the past the sages were loyal only to the avatar when roku died the sages eagerly awaited for the next avatar to return but he never came
looking down guiltily they were waiting for me
humorously mocking hey dont feel bad youre only a hundred years late aang scowls heavily at sokka
they lost hope the avatar would ever return when fire lord sozin began the war my grandfather and the other sages were forced to follow him shakes head sadly i never wanted to serve the fire lord when i learned you were coming i knew i would have to betray the other sages
thank you for helping me closeup as shyu smiles to aang
continues leading the group up a spiraling flight of stairs well follow these stairs to the sanctuary time skip shyu continues talking as they near the top of the stairs once youre inside wait for the light to hit avatar rokus statue only then will you be able to speak with him
slides back a secret tile and climbs into the outer sanctuary massive columns with dragon statues atop them line the room an immense door is before them with a device holding five openmouthed dragons
gasps no
approaches door shyu whats wrong
the sanctuary doors theyre closed
aang tugs at the door uselessly cant you just open them with firebending like you opened that other door
no only a fully realized avatar is powerful enough to open this door alone otherwise the sages must open this door together sokka shown in deep thought with five simultaneous fire blasts
ponderously states five fire blasts huh zoom out to show a lamplight above him i think i can help you out
the scene switches to zukos smokebillowing ship closeup to show a small vessel holding zuko being slid into the waters
uncle keep heading north zhao will follow the smoke trail while i use it as a cover
iroh grunts in doubt stroking his beard in deep thought zukos boat settles on the oceans surface and disappears in the smoke switch to a telescope view of nothing but smoke zhao lowers telescope staring with determination
switch to view of sanctuary door
kneeling pours oil into a bag this is a little trick i picked up from my father i seal the lamp oil inside an animal skin casing shyu lights the oil soaked twine and picks up bag holds it proudly before him tada fake firebending
impressed youve really outdone yourself this time sokka
this might actually work
time skip sokka places his last bag into the dragons mouth the sages will hear the explosion so as soon as they go off you rush in
hides behind a column with her brother holds momo glances to the next column where aang hides its almost sunset are you ready
definitely
shyu thrusts his finger forward sending a small flare racing across the door to light all five bags at once shyu hurries to take cover there is an intense explosion producing a lot of smoke aang bursts forward and runs for the door aang strains to open the door which has not budged
surprised theyre still locked
sadly sighs sokka rises from hiding behind his sister it didnt work aang falls to his knees
time skip everyone stands in front of the door aang beats upon it furiously with consecutive airbending slices why wont it open
presses forward seizes aangs arm aang stop relaxes releasing his arm theres nothing else we can do 
glumly im sorry i put you through all of this for nothing
examining the explosion runs his finger across the black soot i dont get it that firebending looked as strong as any firebending ive seen
a moment passes sudden excitement sokka youre a genius
confused wait how is sokka a genius his plan didnt even work
pleasantly come on aang let her dream
youre right sokkas plan didnt work but it looks like it did
dubiously did the definition of genius change over the last hundred years katara grasps her chin slyly grinning toward aang
time skip fire sages run toward shyu in front of the door come quickly the avatar has entered the sanctuary
how did he get in
i dont know but look at the scorch marks and down there points to a shadow visible at the bottom of the door
hes inside open the doors immediately before he contacts avatar roku
aang slides into position behind a nearby column as the five sages firebend the doors locks open as the door opens a sooty momo is revealed sitting on the floor momo sneezes blowing the soot off himself
its the avatars lemur he must have crawled through the pipes weve been tricked
momo springs into action leaping atop the great fire sages head and clinging to his hat katara charged forward pulling a nearby sages tunic over his head to blind him sokka grabs the lower skirt of a sages outfit lifting it completely over his body to cover his face
grabs the last free sage and hauls him into his grip pinning him now aang
a moment of silence aang nows your chance
steps out from behind column grips aang from behind pinning aangs arms behind him the avatars coming with me the captured sages use their captors surprise to reclaim the upper hand pinning their captors down momo flies off with the great fire sages hat close the doors quickly
walking down steps aang glances over his shoulders to see sokka and katara being chained to a column he breaks free spinning behind zuko to send him down the stairs with an airbending blast aang runs for katara and sokka
chained sees him coming toward her turns head toward the closing door go
aang listens without hesitation turning to charge for the door guarded by two sages he leaps into the air to avoid the great fire sages fire punch aang bounces off his hands from each of the two sages heads before sailing through the door just as it closes
pleased he made it
everyone looks away as the door seals with a blinding flash of white light inside aang is kneeling and looks up to a tall statue of avatar roku a beam of red sunlight enters the room and strikes a glistening red jewel held by the statue
stands confused the light hits the statue and i talk to roku so why isnt anything happening
he and four sages launch fire blasts into the doors locks nothing happens frustrated why isnt it working its sealed shut
it must have been the light avatar roku doesnt want us inside
exasperated standing in the middle of the room facing the statue why isnt anything happening i dont know what im doing all i know is airbending please avatar roku talk to me
rokus statue turns red as sunlight engulfs it its eyes glow white view of aang as smoke fills the room when the white smoke dissipates avatar roku is standing before him they are on a mountaintop and only clouds are visible below
its good to see you aang what took you so long aang respectfully places a fist into his palm bowing his head to the avatar before him
firmly to shyu who is kneeling before him with his hands behind his back why did you help the avatar
sadly and proudly because it was once the sages duty it is still our duty
claps interrupts interrogation approaches with six firebender guards what a moving and heartfelt performance im certain the fire lord will understand when you explain why you betrayed him
places palms together bows head forward commander zhao
and prince zuko it was a noble effort but your little smokescreen didnt work zuko scowls sharply firebenders step behind him seizing his arms two traitors in one day the fire lord will be pleased
strains against his captor snaps at zhao youre too late zhao the avatars inside and the doors are sealed
no matter grins confidently sooner or later he has to come out katara and sokka share a worried glance
i have something very important to tell you aang that is why when you were in the spirit world i sent my dragon to find you
interested curious is it about that vision the one of the comet
yes
what does it mean
one hundred years ago viewers see a visual of a comet in the dark sky fire lord sozin used that comet to begin the war he and his firebending army harnessed its incredible power and dealt a deadly first strike against the other nations
closeup so the comet made them stronger
closeup yes stronger than you could even imagine
closeup but that happened a hundred years ago what does the comet have to do with the war now
listen carefully viewers see silhouette of fire lord ozai standing amid flames fists taut sozins comet will return by the end of the summer and fire lord ozai will use its power to finish the war once and for all visual and audio of ozais silhouette roaring upward fire streaming from his mouth if he succeeds even the avatar wont be able to restore balance to the world aang you must defeat the fire lord before the comet arrives
counters anxiously but i havent even started learning waterbending not to mention earth and fire
mastering the elements takes years of discipline and practice but if the world is to survive you must do it by summers end closeup of a shocked aang
firebenders including zhao and his crew circle around the doors perimeter assuming a firebending form a monk chant begins for the audience only they wait patiently for the door to open
when those doors open shouts unleash all your firepower
worried hows aang gonna make it out of this
troubled questioning how are we gonna make it out of this
terrified what if i cant master all the elements in time what if i fail
i know you can do it aang closeup of half his face for you have done it before closeup of half of aangs nowsmiling face the solstice is ending we must go our separate ways for now
but i wont be able to come back to the temple what if i have questions how will i talk to you
i am a part of you when you need to talk to me again you will find a way closes his eyes providing aang a vision of fire navy ships surrounding the island speaks to his mind without words a great danger awaits you at the temple provides a vision of the awaiting firebenders on the other side of the door i can help you face the threat but only if you are ready
eyes and arrows glow im ready
scene switches to the guard surrounding the door the door glows bright white once again smoke streams come through into the room the door unlocks itself beginning to open as it opens a blinding white light forces all present to look away
ready  light fades revealing a pair of glowing white eyes in the darkness
sokka struggles against his chains katara is terrified no aang
fire he and his guards cooperate in blasting fire onto the unseen target
the wall of fire amasses circling its new host as avatar roku eyes aglow is revealed behind the flames untouched closeup of a shocked and horrorstricken zhao
in awe avatar roku 
avatar roku draws the circling fire together in one motion he sends it forward in one powerful wave that sears the room blasting the offenders off their feet and melting the chains binding katara sokka shyu and zuko with precision view of outside the temple as the blast destroys the outer wall closeup of ghostly avatar roku turning his glowing glare upon the offending sages the sages panic all turning to run from his wrath
implores avatar roku is going to destroy the temple we have to get out of here
not without aang
roku kneels into a forward strike melting the floor with a molten firebending trail he steadily lifts his hand causing the stream of lava below to erupt into maddened explosions the lava soars through the temple tearing it apart zhao and his firebenders are shown fleeing for the temples exit
katara and sokka huddle together arminarm behind a column sokka kneels over his sister protecting her in a brotherly fashion the destruction ceases momentarily as roku lowers his hands exhaling soundly the solstice beam of sunlight is shown leaving his statue its eyes no longer glow as this happens all smoke in the room draws in upon avatar roku his form disappearing to leave behind a weary aang
aang sighs weakly and drops to his knees sokka and katara approach aangs sides supportively lifting him back to his feet we got your back
weakly thanks wheres shyu
 walking away with sokka helping aang i dont know
visual of the temple as it begins to lean due to the destruction caused aang katara and sokka stare in horror upon seeing the stairwell leading to the exit filled with lava they quickly turn to the only exit the hole in the wall roku had created there is no escaping as they are on the top level of the temple
all three gasp in surprise as they notice appa and momo swiftly closing in they run out of the temple leaping into appas saddle scene of them flying away on appa gazing back at the destruction momo pops up wearing the great fire sages hat scene of zhao watching the bison fly away
turns angrily snapping no prince no avatar apparently the only thing i do have is five traitors
interjects but commander only shyu helped the avatar
closeup save your stories for the fire lord as far as im concerned you are all guilty orders take them to the prison hold
the scene changes to show zuko spying with his telescope toward appa flying away he lowers the telescope and sails off in his vessel
night time falls appa flies through the clouds scene from behind a mourning aang with his head hung katara and sokka stand and approach their friend kneeling behind him to support him katara puts her hand around aangs shoulders
fades to credits
scene opens with the camera zoomed out showing appa flying in above the mountains with a few viewable trees carrying aang katara sokka and momo
aang is pacing around on appas saddle breathing heavily would you sit down turns around from his perch on appas head if we hit a bump youll go flying off whats bugging you anyway
worriedly its what avatar roku said im supposed to master all four elements before that comet arrives
in a sarcastic amused tone while facing aang well lets see you pretty much mastered airbending and that only took you a hundred and twelve years im sure you can master three more elements by next summer
frightfully i havent even started waterbending and were still weeks away from the north pole what am i gonna do
grabs aangs arm calm down its going to be okay aang sits down in front of her if you want i can try to teach you some of the stuff i know
smiling youd do that
nods and looks over the side of appas saddle well need to find a good source of water first
grinning sarcastically maybe we can find a puddle for you to splash in
cuts to aang katara sokka and momo standing in front of a large waterfall and river
frowning beside aang and kataras ecstatic faces nice puddle
appa flies down into the river and creates a huge splash that soaks and almost knocks momo of the rock he is standing on turns over and floats on his back
takes off his shirt smiling yeah dont start without me boy begins to run toward the water
somewhat blankly remember the reason were here
stops short and looks at katara oh right time to practice waterbending puts his clothes back on
sarcastically great so what am i supposed to do
you could  clean the gunk out of appas toes hands sokka a branch with a bushel of leaves at the end
frowns and crosses his arms so while you guys are playing in the water im supposed to be hard at work picking mud out of a giant bisons feet
smiles somewhat cheerfully mud and bugs
okay takes stick and walks over to appa who is floating in the water
scene changes to zukos ship in the ocean on the deck zuko is practicing firebending with his  lieutenant lee when the boat turns and they are thrown to one side on their backs
closeup of his face he glares at the tower someones changing our course
cuts to a crew member steering the ship at the top of the boat
storming in yelling what is the meaning of this mutiny no one told you to change course shows iroh and the rest of the crew playing pai sho behind them
actually someone did i assure you it is a matter of utmost importance prince zuko scratches beard
hopefully is it something to do with the avatar
even more urgent it seems i rubs forehead in stress i have lost my lotus tile moves a piece of his across the pai sho board
confused lotus tile
for my pai sho game most people think the lotus tile insignificant but it is essential for the unusual strategy that i employ
in disbelief youve changed our course for a stupid lotus tile
see you like most people underestimate its value just give me ten minutes to check the merchants at this port of call excitedly hopefully they will have the lotus tile in stock and i can get on with my life zuko breathes fire up at the ceiling in anger and iroh smiles im lucky to have such an understanding nephew
the room fills with smoke of zukos outburst clouding the scene from view
cut to a scene of a content appa floating in the river while sokka stands on his stomach and brushes in between his toes with the branch
yeah dont get too happy youve got to do me next appa moans happily
shows katara and aang by the shore
this is a pretty basic move but is still took me months to perfect so dont get frustrated if you dont get it right away she moves her hands back and forth and makes small waves in the water while aang looks up smiling just push and pull the water like this the key is getting the wrist movement right
stands up like this does the hand movements katara is doing but nothing is happening yet
kindly thats almost right if you keep practicing im sure eventually
hey im bending it already shows aang making much bigger waves than kataras on his first try
surprised wow i cant believe you got that so quickly it took me two months to learn that move
shrugs shoulders well you had to figure it all on your own im lucky enough to have a great teacher
smiles thanks
so whats next
this is a more difficult move i call it streaming the water she moves her hands and raises a stream of water from the river into the air and moves it around its harder than it looks so dont be disappointed if shows aang already controlling a stream of water moving it around and above his body and neatly coiling it back into the river much to kataras dismay nice work she frowns though the overthehead flare was unnecessary
sorry excited well dont stop now keep em coming
looks up sadly well i kind of know this one other move but its pretty hard i havent even totally figured it out yet the idea is to create a big powerful wave she moves her hands up shaking and starts to get a big mass of water to rise out of the river but it pops before forming into anything substantial
so like this he raises his hands and creates a massive wave that towers over their heads
still working on cleaning up appa he looks up and stares at aangs wave crashing toward him in fear aang the wave throws sokka off into the water and his head slowly rises out annoyed
smiling looks like i got the hang of that move what else do you got
angry at aangs quick success thats enough practicing for today
head still sticking out of the water yeah ill say points to the left you just practiced our supplies down the river shows a group of bags floating away
looking guilty uh sorry smiles worriedly im sure we can find somewhere to replace all this stuff
my life was hard enough when you were just an airbender sinks back underwater
cuts to katara sokka and aang walking through the streets of a city market and port shows many armed men staring at the trio sokka and katara look nervous while aang looks around in wonder
walking back from alleyway with a bag over his shoulders weve got exactly three copper pieces left from the money that king bumi gave us lets spend it wisely
uh make that two copper pieces sokka i couldnt say no to this whistle pulls out a white whistle that looks like a bison takes a huge breath and blows into it but it barely makes a sound
pulls out fingers over his ears after expecting a loud noise it doesnt even work aang stops blowing when momo squawks at him see even momo thinks its a piece of junk
no offense aang but ill hold the money from now on aang hands her the two copper coins
cuts to the other side of the port where a man is talking in front of his boat docked in the water
moving hands and shouting excitedly earth nation fire nation water nation so long as bargains are your inclination youre welcome here dont be shy come on by sokka katara and aang walk by and he runs up to them oh you there i can see from your clothing that youre worldtraveling types perhaps i can interest you in some exotic curios
walks back to the man sure what are curios
looks confused and thinks im not entirely sure but we got em puts his hand on aangs shoulder and smiles walking him into the ship
cuts to the inside of the boat where strange collectibles are lined up on shelves on the walls aang katara and sokka walk in
looks up close at an item on a shelf confused huh
katara stares at an ornate monkey statue on one of the shelves eerily
standing in a dark doorway as aang passes by with momo on his back ive never seen such a fine specimen of lemur walks into the light an iguana parrot on his shoulder that beast would fetch me a hefty sum if youd be interested in bartering the iguana parrot squawks at them
grabbing momo momos not for sale
shows katara walking over to a shelf where a number of scrolls are kept she grabs one with the waterbending symbol on it and opens it to see lines of waterbending diagrams and writing
smiling look at this aang its a waterbending scroll aang walks over check out these crazy moves
turns to the captain excited where did you get a waterbending scroll
slams his hand onto the scroll and pulls it away lets just say i got it up north at a most reasonable price free rolls the scroll back up and puts it away back in its shelf
turns around and looks at the captain from the other side of the room wait a minute  sea loving traders with suspiciously acquired merchandise raises eyebrows almost yelling and pet reptile birds turns around to oh almost spitting in his face you guys are pirates
puts his arm around a terrified sokkas shoulders we prefer to think of ourselves as high risk traders
cuts to katara holding their two copper pieces next to aang with the captain on the other side of the counter they are leaning on
so how much for the uh traded scroll
ive already got a buyer a nobleman in the earth kingdom voice turns less serious unless of course you kids have two hundred gold pieces on you right now
turns around and whispers to katara i know how to deal with these guys katara pirates love to haggle katara drops the final coins in his hand watch and learn walks over to the counter leans against it and talks in a pirate voice lets say to the price of one copper piece smiles and dramatically presents the single coin
laughs hysterically the price is two hundred gold pieces i dont haggle on items this rare
still smirking and talking like a pirate okay two copper pieces
aggravated its not as amusing the second time boy
whispering aang can we get out of here i feel like were getting weird looks
aye we be casting off now walks away
cuts back to outside aang katara and sokka are walking off the boat and back down the street
what was that all about katara
yeah i was just starting to browse through their boomerang collection
worried holding her arms ill just feel a lot better once we get away from here
cuts back to the pirate ship oh is running across the deck looking for them
hey you get back here
calmly turns around well well look whos come to their senses told you the haggling would pay off
suddenly the group of armed pirates jump out of the boat and run to aang katara and sokka whispering menacingly and swinging their weapons
scared i dont think these pirates are here to trade with us turns around and runs aang and sokka follow and the pirates chase behind them half of the group runs down one street while the other goes down the one next to it
this way lets cut em off
turning a corner with aang and katara whoa katara freezes a puddle behind them that a pirate slips on
cuts to peaceful scene of the cabbage merchant with his cart of cabbages in an alleyway sokka katara and aang run past him and almost knock his cart over aang sends a blast of wind that throws the cart into the group of pirates behind them
angry my cabbages this place is worse than omashu
group of pirates jump out of another street and chase aang sokka katara and momo
i hope that lemur of yours has nine lives
him and the pirates corner them in the dead end of a street now who gets to taste the steel of my blade first
no thanks spins and hurls a blast of air at the pirates that send them backward and runs toward them with his glider out grab on tight
aang i thought we were running away from the pirates jumps on to aangs glider with sokka and they lift off into the air
just hang on flies over the pirates heads and into the distance
cuts back to their camp by the river where aang sokka and katara stand by the shore
putting his glider away i used to kind of look up to pirates but those guys are terrible
mischievously i know thats why i took this holds out the waterbending scroll they saw in the shop
surprised no way
excited isnt it great
no wonder they were trying to hack us up you stole their waterbending scroll
jokingly i prefer to think of it as high risk trading
laughs good one katara
sokka where do you think they got it they stole it from a waterbender
it doesnt matter you put all of our lives in danger just so you could learn some stupid fancy splashes
these are real waterbending forms you know how crucial it is for aang to learn waterbending
walks away whatever
well whats done is done we have it we might as well learn from it
the scene cuts to show zuko and iroh standing in the market place
ive checked all the shops on this pier not a lotus tile in the entire marketplace
its good to know this trip was a complete waste of time for everyone
quite the contrary i always say the only thing better than finding something you are looking for crew members begin to walk past carrying irohs purchases is finding something you werent looking for at a great bargain a crew member walks past the two playing a tsungi horn
you bought a tsungi horn
for music night on the ship now if we only had some woodwinds pointing to the ship oh this place looks promising the monkey statue is shown again oh that is handsome wouldnt it look magnificent in the galley
to pirate captain we lost the water tribe girl and the little bald monk she was traveling with
turning this monk did he have an arrow on his head iroh turns around making a face similar to the monkeys
the camera cuts show katara looking at the scroll
i just want to try this one move first and then its all yours gives it to aang here hold it open for me the single water whip looks doable attempts the move but ends up hitting herself in the forehead ow
ha ha ha
glaring at sokka whats so funny
im sorry but you deserved that to aang youve been duped shes only interested in teaching herself
angrily aang will get his turn once i figure out the water whip she tries again but hits momo instead who screeches ugh why cant i get this stupid move
youll get it katara glares at him you just gotta shift your weight through the stances he tries and does it perfectly on the first try there see the key to bending is
screaming will you please shut your air hole believe it or not your infinite wisdom gets a little old sometimes why dont we just throw the scroll away since youre so naturally gifted sokka glares at her what she looks back at aang who has tears in his eyes oh my gosh aang i am so sorry i dont know what came over me but you know what it wont happen again she gives the scroll to aang here this is yours i dont want to have anything to do with it anymore
its okay katara
what about momo hes the real victim here
bends down to pet momo as he rubs his hind end im sorry momo
and what about me there was that time you
no more apologies
the camera fades to show a much smaller boat being launched out of zukos ship the camera fades again to show the boat and the pirate ship sailing down a river
shouldnt we stop to search the woods
we dont need to stop they stole a waterbending scroll right
mmhm
then theyll be on the water
the scene fades to show katara sokka and aang sleeping by the campfire katara quietly takes the scroll and sneaks away from the camp however when she turns around she comes facetoface with momo who starts chattering
whispering shhh momo go back to sleep shh the camera fades to show her standing by the river attempting but failing to perfect the water whip frustrated ugh ugh ugh shoot come on water work with me here okay what if i just ow stupid scroll the pirate captain and zuko are shown hearing her okay katara shift your weight through the stances she drops the water again and hears the ship pulling up onto the river bank she peaks through the bushes to see what the noise was and gasps upon seeing the pirates she turns to run but it grabbed by a pirate no let go of me she bends water up into the pirates face and he releases her she runs but is grabbed again on the wrists by zuko
he glares at her as she looks frightfully at him ill save you from the pirates
the scene cuts to show katara tied to a tree with zuko standing in front of her
tell me where he is and i wont hurt you or your brother
furiously go jump in the river
try to understand i need to capture him to restore something ive lost my honor katara jerks her head away from zuko perhaps in exchange i can restore something youve lost he holds her mothers necklace up to her neck
my mothers necklace how did you get that
i didnt steal it if thats what youre wondering tell me where he is points at katara
no
enough of this necklace garbage you promised a scroll
i wonder how much this is worth  the pirates gasp as he takes it out and holds it over a fire in his hand a lot apparently now you help me find what i want youll get this back and everyone goes home happy search the woods for the boy and meet back here
fine
the scene cuts to the campsite where sokka is waking up
notices kataras missing huh where did she go looks through the bag i dont believe it
yawns whats wrong
she took the scroll shes obsessed with that thing its just a matter of time before she gets us all in deep yells as a pirate throws a rope around his arms and drags him forward he rolls away and charges at the pirate while another pirate captures aang in a net and drags him away
i got him come on
oh what im not good enough to kidnap ah the pirate shoots another net at sokka and drags him away too
cuts back to the place where zuko and the pirates are gathered the pirates are holding aang and sokka who are tied up sokka is struggling with the ropes
nice work
aang this is all my fault
no katara it isnt
yeah it kind of is katara glares at iroh
to the pirate captain give me the boy
you give us the scroll
youre really gonna hand over the avatar for a stupid piece of parchment
dont listen to him hes trying to turn us against each other
turns to aang your friend is the avatar
sure is and ill bet hell fetch a lot more on the black market than that fancy scroll
shut your mouth you water tribe peasant
yeah sokka you really should shut your mouth
im just sayin its bad business sense think how much the fire lord would pay for the avatar you guys would be set for life
to zuko keep the scroll we can buy a hundred with the reward well get for the kid the pirates turn to leave
youll regret breaking a deal with me he and two of his soldiers send a blast of fire at the pirates the pirates jump back and oh runs out throwing smoke bombs and jumping into the cloud as the fight ensues some of the soldiers run out to sokka and aang who are struggling with their ropes but are stopped by several pirates momo runs down the tree and frees katara
thanks momo i owe you a bushel of apples she runs to join the fight aang is shown lost in the smoke a thrown knife narrowly misses him and cuts through his ropes zuko finds his way out of the smoke cloud and hides the scroll behind his back but the pirate captain sees him and the two begin to fight the scroll flies into the air and his caught by momo the iguana parrot sees him and hits momo the scroll flies back down to the ground a knife narrowly misses sokkas head and he uses it to cuts the ropes on his hands
shouting aang are you there
im over here follow my voice
where i cant find you
im right here airbends the dust away revealing the pirates surrounding him and immediately airbends it back around himself never mind ill find you sokka climbs out of the dust cloud on his hands and knees aang vaults over him in a full sprint run they find katara who is trying to push the pirate boat back into the water katara youre okay
help me get this boat back in the water so we can get outta here they join her in trying to push the boat but cant
wed need a team of rhinos to budge this ship
a team of rhinos or two waterbenders
cuts to aang and katara pushing and pulling the water until the boat rises up
everybody in
cuts to show iroh breaking up the fight between the pirate captain and zuko
are you so busy fighting you cannot see your own ship has set sail
we have no time for your proverbs uncle
its no proverb points to team avatar who has hijacked the pirate ship
bleeding hog monkeys zuko laughs while pointing at him his laughter dissipates as the pirates hijack his own boat the pirates taunt him and the screen pans to a steaming zuko
angrily hey thats my boat goes chasing after the hijacked boat
pondering maybe it should be a proverb 
off camera cmon uncle iroh runs after zuko
sokka cant you make it go any faster
i dont know how this thing wasnt made by the water tribe
several of the pirates jump onto the ship but are quickly swept away by aangs waterbending determined katara performs a perfect water whip to throw the last pirate off
hey you did the water whip
i couldnt have done it without your help
sokka is shown being held in place by two pirates
would you two quit congratulating each other and help me out
momo is shown still being chased by the iguana parrot he flies up to the top mast and entangles the bird in the ships flag sokka is shown being thrown by one of the pirates
thats good  aang lands behind him and airbends him and the other pirate off the ship before jumping down to sokka
pointing aang look the ship is shown headed toward a huge waterfall
oh no 
oh comes up behind him with a knife aang turns and blows the bison whistle oh stands confused while sokka comes up behind him and pushes him off the ship
have you lost your mind this is no time for flute practice katara and aang stare in horror at the approaching waterfall
we can stop the boat aang together push and pull the water they create a small whirlpool that stops the boat its working its slowing down were doing it
but we have another problem zukos boat is shown sailing straight toward their ship the boat rams into the ship and sokka aang and katara are forced to jump as the boat goes over the falls
jump appa is shown flying toward them they land on him and fly to safety
holding up the whistle i knew a bison whistle would come in handy thanks appa
yeah we owe you one appa roars and the scene cuts to show zuko running to the cliff in horror at the fact that his boat has gone over the falls
my boat
chuckles prince zuko youre really going to get a kick out of this that lotus tile was in my sleeve the whole time has a big smile on his face
zuko snatches the lotus tile and furiously throws it down the waterfall
cuts back to appa flying through the clouds
aang i still owe you an apology you were just so good at waterbending without really trying i got so competitive that i put us all in danger im sorry
thats okay katara
besides who needs that stupid scroll anyway
holding the scroll sarcastically is that really how you feel
the scroll
puts his hand in front to keep katara from grabbing it first what did you learn
stealing is wrong snatches scroll unless its from pirates
laughing good one katara
fades to credits
the episode opens in a forest momo is chasing a bug through the trees in his pursuit he lands on the ground to see a neatly stacked pile of lychee nuts when he runs toward it momo is pulled into the air by a cage trap joining two other caged animals camera changes focus to find the rest of team avatar camping
wheres momo camera zooms in to closeup shot of aang katara and sokka the siblings sitting next to each other with bored faces and aang standing with his back to the camera momo screeches and the gang looks around
camera fades to find aang as he spots the three animals in their cage traps hanging by rope on tree limbs
hang on momo aang uses his airbending to fly to the top of the tree jumping from trunktotrunk to get higher he finds the traps mechanisms undoes them and carefully lowers momo to the ground where katara and sokka are waiting they open the trap together and the lemur runs out with one of the lychee nuts in his mouth katara and sokka look on as momo gets on his hind legs and eats it as though nothing has happened sokka grunts in frustration and facepalms when aang lands he looks up to see the other two animals seemingly crying out to him for help all right you too jumps up to them
this is gonna take forever throws his boomerang to simply cut the animals free
inching his way upsidedown to the traps on the tree branch they fall before he can reach them that works
the hog monkeys run up the tree and out of the cameras view and aang jumps back down dirt flying from the ground as he lands everyone gathers around two of the traps and sokka kneels down to examine them
these are fire nation traps camera zooms to upward shot of the gang looking at the trap you can tell from the metalwork we better pack up camp and get moving
they gather their things and begin to pack them onto appas saddle
uh uh no flying this time
confused what why wouldnt we fly
takes the sleeping bag from aangs hands think about it somehow prince zuko and the fire nation keep finding us its because they spot appa hes just too noticeable
what appas not too noticeable
points dramatically at appa condescendingly hes a gigantic fluffy monster with an arrow on his head its kinda hard to miss him the bison yawns and the camera flashes to aang sitting comfortably on the animals head
to appa sokkas just jealous cause he doesnt have an arrow
camera closes in on sokka and katara next to each other i know you all wanna fly but my instincts tell me we should play it safe this time and walk
leans forward at her brother and smiles who made you the boss
points his finger at his chest to katara im not the boss im the leader
amused youre the leader but your voice still cracks
voice cracks im the oldest and im a warrior so deepens voice im the leader
closeup shot of kataras face if anyones the leader its aang i mean he is the avatar pan back to sokka
are you kidding hes just a goofy kid
while hanging upsidedown from appas right horn with feet sticking out in the air hes right
why do boys always think someone has to be the leader i bet you wouldnt be so bossy if you kissed a girl
closeup on sokka defensively ive kissed a girl you just havent met her
back to sokka who grangran ive met grangran
throws arms into the air no besides grangran look my instincts tell me we have a better chance of slipping through on foot and a leader has to trust his instincts
sarcastically okay well try it your way oh wise leader
aang steps over now wearing a backpack momo is sitting on the top who knows walking might be fun cut to the forest at a later time between trees the group trudges along with sokka in front followed by aang and momo katara and appa walking stinks how do people go anywhere without a flying bison
sarcastically well i dont know aang why dont you ask sokkas instincts they seem to know everything
sarcastically ha ha very funny
complaining im tired of carrying this pack
you know who you should ask to carry it for a while sokkas instincts sokkas eyes turn to her in irritation
thats a great idea hey sokkas instincts would you mind
okay okay i get it look guys im tired too but the important thing is that were safe from the walks through a bush and sees something in front of him fire  nation
sokka sees a fire nation campsite with a lot of soldiers most of them are seated or crouched near the fire with bowls in hand and a couple of them sit close to the tents which have the fire nation emblem on the doorflap one of these soldiers has a patch over his left eye they all notice the group and get up
run they turn to run but a firebender blocks them off by setting the plants behind them on fire were cut off
sokka your shirt sokka yells katara clears a fire on sokkas shirt with waterbending
if you let us pass we promise not to hurt you
whispers what are you doing
whispers bluffing
you promise not to hurt us hes somehow knocked out
nice work sokka howd you do that
uh instinct
points up a tree look
in a tree a man with hook swords jet jumps and takes down two soldiers he runs forward and takes down two more using his hook swords
down you go katara looks amazed aang shocked and sokka confused
another soldier charges at jet but he is defeated
theyre in the trees
a young boy lands on top of the soldier and turns his helmet around to blind him before riding him around while laughing another boy launches arrows at the soldiers while more boys come out of the trees aang and katara are shown fighting the soldiers sokka holds up his boomerang and yells as one approaches him but stops when jet takes him down first
hey he was mine
gotta be quicker next time
sokka looks dismayed and the camera cuts to show a huge boy fall out of the trees and easily take down two soldiers as jet skillfully takes down one more causing this soldiers weapon to hit another soldier who was going to battle sokka in the head making that soldier also fall down
angrily man
jet disarms another soldier and runs up to katara
hey
hi
they look around to see a now empty camp
amazed you just took out a whole army almost singlehanded
disdainfully army there were only like twenty guys
my name is jet and these are my freedom fighters sneers longshot smellerbee the duke and pipsqueak
laughing looking at the duke ha ha pipsqueak thats a funny name the duke sniffs his nose as the camera pans upward to pipsqueak
looming over aang in a threatening manner in a low growling tone of voice you think my name is funny
sideshot aang looks taken aback for a second before replying in an upbeat tone its hilarious
facial shot of pipsqueak still looming forward with a frown on his face he suddenly starts laughing the camera moves back showing aang and the duke following suit pipsqueak pats the avatar on the back in a friendly manner though the hit was hard enough to knock aang flat on the ground the duke stops laughing and looks down at aang sprawled on the ground before his feet face flat in the dirt though when aang raises his head and continues laughing so does the duke
the scene fades to the fire nation camp and the camera cuts to show the freedom fighters raiding the empty camp
approaching jet umm thanks for saving us jet were lucky you were there
i should be thanking you we were waiting to ambush those soldiers all morning we just needed the right distraction and then you guys stumbled in
eyeing sokka we were relying on instincts
youll get yourself killed doing that
sokka looks at them disdainfully as the duke and pipsqueak look through the barrels
hey jet these barrels are filled of blasting jelly
thats a great score
and these boxes are filled with jelly candy
also good lets not get those mixed up
well take this stuff back to the hideout
you guys have a hideout
you wanna see it
very excitedly yes we wanna see it
jet smiles at her and the camera fades to show them standing on the forest floor
were here
where theres nothing here
hold this gives a rope to sokka
skeptically why whats this do screams as he is pulled up into the branches
aang offers aang another rope
ill get up on my own leaps up into the trees with airbending
grab hold of me katara
katara blushes as she takes his hand and they rise up through the tree together in a romantic setting they come to a landing on a wooden platform in the trees once up there aang is seen zip lining through the trees
while passing through with momo nice place you got
its beautiful up here
its beautiful  and more importantly the fire nation cant find us smellerbee lands near the two
they would love to find you wouldnt they jet
its not gonna happen smellerbee
as aang zips by again why does the fire nation want to find you
i guess you could say ive been causing them a little trouble see they took over a nearby earth kingdom town a few years back
weve been ambushin their troops cutting off their supply lines and doing anything we can to mess with em sokka is now seen comically hopping around trying to get past pipsqueak
one day well drive the fire nation out of here for good and free that town
thats so brave sokka manages to get by pipsqueak
sarcastically yeah nothings braver than a guy in a tree house
dont pay any attention to my brother
no problem he probably had a rough day
so you all live here sokka who is being ignored comically sinks back behind them
thats right longshot over there the screen cuts to longshot and the duke walking not making a sound his town got burned down by the fire nation and we found the duke trying to steal our food i dont think he ever really had a home
what about you
katara and jet come to a halt as the rest pass the fire nation killed my parents i was only eight years old that day changed me forever
sokka and i lost our mother to the fire nation
im so sorry katara
the screen fades from the two of them alone on the suspension bridge to the blue sky above the canopy a cloud of cawing birds is disturbed as appa raises his head with a roar in the hideout ropes with lanterns hang between branches sentries keep watch on several upper platforms while the group sits at a banquet table while the group eats jet stands on the table
today we struck another blow against the fire nation swine everyone cheers katara and aang smile while sokka cops an attitude and a scowling face i got a special joy from the look on one soldiers face when the duke dropped down on his helmet and rode him like a wild hog monkey the duke without his helmet climbs up the table he marches on the table with his arms in the air now the fire nation thinks they dont have to worry about a couple of kids hiding in the trees he prepares to take a drink from his wooden cup maybe theyre right a very loud and long boo is heard with an angry face or maybe  theyre dead wrong a loud and long cheer is heard
hey jet nice speech
thanks by the way i was really impressed with you and aang that was some great bending i saw out there today
well hes great hes the avatar blushes i could use some more training
avatar huh very nice
thanks jet
so i might know a way that you and aang can help in our struggle
unfortunately we have to leave tonight sokka starts walking away
sokka youre kidding me i needed you on an important mission tomorrow sokka turns around
what mission
the scene changes to the top of the forest the next day jet and sokka are in branches of the same tree jet cups his hands and makes a birdcall several trees down pipsqueak and smellerbee step into view from their branches they reply with another birdcall sokka jams his jawbone knife into the trunk of the tree
what are you doing
shh  it amplifies vibrations
impressed good trick
sokka puts his ear to the handle of his knife nothing yet whispers wait yes someones approaching
whispers how many
i think theres just one
does a another birdcall good work sokka ready your weapon sokka takes his knife out of the tree his eyes spot an old man
whispers wait false alarm  hes just an old man
jet ignores sokka and prepares to attack the old man leaping to the ground in front of the traveler sokka watches with horror
what are you doing in our woods you leech
please sir im just a traveler
jet takes a step and with one swipe sends the mans cane flying from his hand the old man backs away but when he tries to flee the way he came he runs face first into pipsqueaks chest the force of the impact knocks him to the ground pipsqueak looms over him he tries to crawl away but pipsqueaks foot on his backside effectively pins him
do you like destroying towns do you like destroying families do you
oh  please let me go  have mercy 
does the fire nation let people go does the fire nation have mercy
jet is about to kick the man but his foot is snagged by sokkas club before it can be delivered sokka releases him
jet hes just an old man
hes fire nation search him pipsqueak holds the prisoner and smellerbee steps up to search the poor man
but hes not hurting anyone
have you forgotten that the fire nation killed your mother remember why you fight
weve got his stuff jet she holds up the old mans bag the old man is thrown back on the ground
this doesnt feel right
its what has to be done now lets get outta here
jet pushes past sokka pipsqueak and smellerbee follow sokka looks at the old man still on his hands and knees in pity
come on sokka
sokka slowly turns and runs to catch up with the others at the hideout aang and momo are playing with the ziplines again he leaps near sokka
sokka look what the duke gave me aang is wearing a bag and pulls a small pellet from it with a sly grin he tosses it next to momo where it explodes with a pop momo puffs up like a startled cat he hisses and lunges for the bag momo sits on aangs shoulder and tosses several pellets at his feet aang dances about wildly ow quit it
sokka is oblivious of it all hes sitting with his back to the trunk and staring at the ground glaring katara walks up
hey sokka is jet back
yeah hes back but were leaving
what
but i made him this hat she shows a cap made out of stitched leaves with a flower on top
your boyfriend jets a thug
what no hes not
hes messed up katara
hes not messed up hes just got a different way of life a really fun way of life
he beat and robbed a harmless old man
i wanna hear jets side of the story the scene changes to jet in a room
sokka you told them what happened but you didnt mention that the guy was fire nation
jet is sitting on a hammockbed the others stand sokka stands grumpily as far away as he can get aang is wearing the hat katara made he looks ridiculous and goofy
no he conveniently left that part out
fine but even if he was fire nation he was a harmless civilian
he was an assassin sokka
jet pulls out a knife and thrusts it into a nearby stump it is a sinister looking curved blade there are four spikes evenly spaced along the grip with enough space for fingers to go between them there is a ring on the butt of the knife
see theres a compartment for poison in the knife he pulls on the ring and removes a small glass tube filled with red liquid he was sent to eliminate me you helped save my life sokka
i knew there was an explanation
i didnt see any knife
thats because he was concealing it
see sokka im sure you just didnt notice the knife
there was no knife im going back to the hut and packing my things sokka stomps away
tell me you guys arent leaving yet i really need your help
what can we do
the fire nation is planning on burning down our forest if you both use waterbending to fill the reservoir we could fight the fires but if you leave now theyll destroy the whole valley
aang and katara look at each other fade to them entering their hut sokka is tying up a mat on the floor
we cant leave now with the fire nation about to burn down a forest
im sorry katara jets very smooth but we cant trust him
you know what i think youre jealous that hes a better warrior and a better leader
katara im not jealous of jet its just that my instinct
well my instincts tell me we need to stay here a little longer and help jet come on aang
sorry sokka
they leave the hut fade to the night sky above the canopy a full moon shines on appa who is on his back and snoring extremely loud as he sleeps inside the trios hut sokka sleeps propped up against his stillpacked gear while the others sleep in their sleeping bags
lets go
sokka wakes up he pulls the door flap aside enough to see some of jets followers descending on the rope lines sokka grabs a rope line down to a lower branch on the ground below him jets freedom fighters are quietly pushing the loaded wagon as jet leads them out of the camp sokka stealthily follows in the dark valley upstream and up toward the wall of the valley there is an old falls and beyond that a manmade dam a bare cliff off to the reservoirs left provides the view jet and his boys emerge from the forest he goes to the edge and looks down on the dam below the reservoir behind it is low he turns back to the wagon
now listen you are not to blow the dam until i give the signal if the reservoir isnt full the fire nation troops could survive the duke jumps off the wagon
but what about the people in the town wont they get wiped out too jet places a hand on the dukes shoulder
look duke thats the price of ridding this area of the fire nation to longshot now dont blow the dam until i give the signalgot it longshot nods
sokka watches incredulously from the bushes he frowns and hears rustling just before pipsqueak drags him out by his wolftail smellerbees knife is instantly at his throat
sneering where do you think youre going ponytail
jet standing near the edge of the cliff as he watches pipsqueak and smellerbee drag sokka between them pipsqueak still has a handful of sokkas wolftail
sokka im glad you decided to join us pipsqueak and smellerbee send sokka to his knees he rubs his shoulder
i heard your plan to destroy the earth kingdom town
our plan is to rid the valley of the fire nation
there are people living there jet mothers and fathers and children
we cant win without making some sacrifices sokka points an accusing finger at jet
you lied to aang and katara about the forest fire
because they dont understand the demands of war not like you and i do
i do understand i understand that theres nothing you wont do to get what you want
i was hoping youd have an open mind but i can see youve made your choice
pipsqueak and smellerbee grab for sokka before he can even react jet has his wrist pinned with the hooks of his shuang gou sokkas other hand is forced behind his back
i cant let you warn katara and aang jet releases sokkas hand it is immediately forced behind his back take him for a walk a long walk
you cant do this
cheer up sokka were gonna win a great victory against the fire nation today
the screen pans to the riverside upriver from the dam the collected water behind it is much less than the larger cavity of the reservoir the river leading to down to it is a thread compared to its rainy season gully jet katara and aang are seen walking upriver along its west bank
jet im sorry about how sokkas been acting
no worries he already apologized
really aang and katara stop and look at one another sokka apologized
yeah i was surprised too i got the sense that maybe you talked to him or something
yeah i did
i guess something you said got through to him anyhow he went out on a scouting mission with pipsqueak and smellerbee
im glad he cooled off hes so stubborn sometimes
they are now walking in the gully beside the river aang pauses after noticing something strange and is launched into the air by a blast from the geyser he was standing on
all right were here underground waters trying to escape through these vents i need you guys to help it along
ive never used bending on water i cant see i dont know  jet stands behind her and places his hands on her shoulders
katara you can do this
airbends himself back on the ground what about me
i know the avatar can do this
aang and katara stand on one of the many geysers in the gully while jet looks on they bend the water up after a few minutes a stream of water emerges from the hole they pull it to their height and send it toward the river where it continues to flow like a waterfall the water quickly joins the river
yes good job this river empties into the reservoira few more geysers and itll be full
look theres another steam vent aang and katara walk off in its direction
okay you two keep it up ill go check on things at the reservoir he turns and walks away
when were done well meet you over there
actually  probably better if you meet me back at the hideout when youre done jet resumes walking away aang and katara bend the next geyser into another fountain
later i bet thats enough and im not just saying that to be lazy around them over a dozen geysers flow into the river
lets catch up with jet at the reservoir
i thought we agreed to meet jet back at the hideout
well we finished early im sure hell be happy to see us
the screen changes to a path in the forest pipsqueak and smellerbee follow sokka who has his hands tied behind his back smellerbee gives sokka a shove sokka stumbles but remains on his feet
come on move along
how can you stand by and do nothing while jet wipes out a whole town
hey listen sokka jets a great leader we follow what he says and things always turn out okay sokka notices a couple of snare leafpiles nearby identical to the one that enticed momo right down to the pile of nuts
if thats how jet leads then hes got a lot to learn sokka sprints off in the direction of the snares smellerbee makes a grab for him but misses
hey they give chase sokka leaps over the leaf piles pipsqueak and smellerbee dont and end up snared and hanging many feet up in the air
while you two are up there you might want to practice your knot work he holds up his nowworthless bindings turns and walks away
hey smellerbee you gonna eat your lychee nuts smellerbee hits him in the head with a lychee nut and it lands in the pile hes holding ooh he picks one up and licks his lips
katara and aang are standing on the edge of the cliff at the base of the dam four of jets people are unloading barrels from the wagon and arranging them
what are they doing
hey those are the red barrels he got from the fire nation
why would they need blasting jelly zooms on aang who is horrified
because jets gonna blow up the dam
what no that would destroy the town jet wouldnt do that aang opens his glider
ive gotta stop him he takes off
less convinced jet wouldnt do that
before aang can reach the edge jet crosses his path from behind and snatches the glider aang is left wobbling precariously on the edge and uses airbending to get himself back on stable footing
yes i would
jet why
katara you would too if you just stopped to think think about what the fire nation did to your mother we cant let them do that to anyone else ever again
this isnt the answer
i want you to understand me katara i thought your brother would understand but
wheres sokka tears fall from her eyes jet reaches out and touches her face
katara
she lowers her head and with a shout sends jet flying with the water from her waterskin she draws it back into the skin when shes done
i need to get to the dam
aangs closed glider is on the ground as he reaches for it one of jets hook swords pins it jet has the two swords hook to hook with a yank he pulls aangs glider to him
youre not going anywhere without your glider
jet swings the swords at aang aang somersaults backward to avoid the extra reach aang finishes his retreat in a nearby tree
im not gonna fight you jet
taunting youll have to if you want your glider back
aang retreats back into the forest as jet hooks the branch and pulls himself up katara follows on the ground jet attacks aang defends himself with balls of air which jet ducks jet attacks head on but aang blocks with his arms and sends his opponent flying into a tree trunk with an air kick jet combines his swords again and advances aang avoids the flaillike move and sends another air blast jet stoops down and lets the air flow over and past him before lunging
they continue the chase through the many levels of the forest jet catches up to aang and sends them both freefalling attacking as they go they both end up on a branch jet continues his attack aang avoids it all jet charges again but aang hits him with a jetstream of air jet falls he recovers but loses the glider in the process before aang can get to the ground jet kicks him into a trunk he lands with a thud next to his glider
a small tributary flows past him aang is slow to get up before jet can take more than a step however he his hit by a large water strike katara is there she uses water from the river to throw jet against the trunk of the tree over and over she attacks jet is unable to cut the water and its force plasters him against the trunk she freezes jet from toe to neck
why jet i cant believe i trusted you you lied to me youre sick and i trusted you a birdcall is heard katara and aang are startled and look to the valley beyond where its coming from jet gives an answering birdcall what are you doing
youre too late
horrified no
aang opens his glider and runs for the nearby cliff his gliders wings are damaged to the point that he has no lift and slams back into the ground near the edge katara runs over to help him
in pain from the fall sokkas still out there hes our only chance
come on sokka im sorry i ever doubted you please
longshot stands on a branch his bow pulled he has a flaming arrow on the string he takes aim and fires it arcs down to the base of the dam katara watches in horror
whispers no 
the center of the dam explodes in a cloud of smoke and fire katara and aang watch a massive wall of water go to the town inside the town the streets are empty except for the occasional barrels and the cabbage merchants cabbage cart the water rushes through the open gate as a cresting wave dwarfs it the wall and gate are swallowed as the wave strikes the town the flotsam carried away includes a smiling doll in a purple dress
sokka didnt make it in time
all those people  she turns in rage back to jet jet you monster
this was a victory katara remember that the fire nation is gone and this valley will be safe
it will be safe without you in shock jet looks up to see sokka appa and momo rise from below the level of the cliff
sokka
i warned the villagers of your plan just in time
what
cuts to an illustrated set of flashback stills each being panned through at first they didnt believe me the fire nation soldiers assumed i was a spy but one man vouched for me the old man you attacked he urged them to trust me and we got everyone out in time the flashback ends and the townsfolk are seen on high ground above the river on the bank opposite the town a little girl who was seen in the flashback runs down to the waters edge as the doll floats by she retrieves it
happily misses pretty she hugs her doll
sokka you fool we couldve freed this valley
who would be free everyone would be dead
you traitor
no jet you became the traitor when you stopped protecting innocent people
katara please help me
goodbye jet sokka gives appas reigns a flick
yip yip jet is left behind still frozen to the tree
the sky they fly in is empty save a few wispy clouds
we thought you were going to the dam how come you went to the town instead
let me guess your instincts told you
shrugs his right shoulder hey sometimes theyre right
um  sokka you know were going the wrong way right sokka is surprised but quickly recovers
and sometimes theyre wrong with a grin he pulls appas reigns they fly off screen before reappearing going in the opposite direction
fades to credits
opening shot of the sun setting behind some tall rock outcroppings the sky is mostly cloudy and the clouds reflect the light of the dying sun pan down to show a patched up tent being jostled about from the inside a rolled up tarp lies next to the tent sokka is inside a tent trying to assemble it sokka can be heard grunting and fussing about as he tries to finish setting up the shelter katara walks in the frame her back to the camera with a pile of fire wood in her arms
um arent you forgetting the tarp
right got it  tosses the wrapped up tarp inside the tent
sokka youre supposed to put the tarp on top of the tent you know so we dont get rained on cut to an overhead shot of the two sokka gesturing widely as he replies to his sister
ordinarily youd be right but seeing how its the dry season youre not besides that tarp makes a pretty warm blanket
but what if it does rain
spreading his arms wide in exasperation what if it doesnt then i would have put up the tarp for nothing
youre infuriating
katara why dont you worry about gathering firewood because that kindling is looking pretty sorry
angrily well if you dont like my firewood throws the sticks at sokka who shields himself from the wood he stands in anger after the hail of sticks subsides
angrily fine by me if youre not gonna do your job he tears the tent down and the two stare at each other angrily as aang approaches
okay i got the grub if you guys got the the siblings turn away from each other in anger with their arms folded hey wheres the campfire and what happened to the tent
why dont you ask miss knowitall queen of the twigs
oh yeah well youre mister lazy bum king of the picks up and throws a twig at sokkas head tents sokka turns around looking angrily at her
laughs okay listen guys harsh words wont solve problems action will why dont you just switch jobs
sounds good
at the same time whatever
grinning while gloating you see that settling feuds and making peace all in a days work for the avatar turns his head to see momo and appa fighting over a watermelon momo continuously tries to fly away with it while appa pins it down aang takes the melon and uses airbending to slice it momo seems to be complaining about how he got the much smaller half and appa got the bigger half come on momo thats fair appas got five stomachs appa eats his half of the melon
the scene fades to show the group standing on the edge of a huge canyon
there it is guys the great divide
in awe wow i could just stare at it forever zoom backward to show sokka in the foreground
okay ive seen enough
how can you not be fascinated sokka this is the largest canyon in the entire world
then im sure well be able to see it very clearly from the air while we fly away
shoving past sokka if youre looking for the canyon guide i was here first
ooh canyon guide sounds informative
believe me hes more than a tour guide hes an earthbender oblivious to the fact that sokka is behind him mocking him and the only way in and out of the canyon is with his help and hes taking my tribe across next
calm down we know youre next
you wouldnt be so calm if the fire nation destroyed your home and forced you to flee my whole tribe has to walk thousands of miles to the capital city of ba sing se
youre a refugee
huh tell me something i dont know
a large group of poorly dressed people is shown walking toward them
is that your tribe
it most certainly is not thats the zhang tribe a bunch of lowlife thieves theyve been the enemies of my tribe for a hundred years whistles to them hey zhangs im saving a spot for my tribe so dont even think about stealing it
where are the rest of the gan jin still tidying up their camp site
yes but they sent me ahead of them to hold a spot
i didnt know the canyon guide took reservations
ha of course you didnt thats the ignorance id expect from a messy zhang so unorganized and illprepared for a journey the zhang tribe members yell out in protest behind them katara and aang look at each other worriedly but turn around to see a large pile of rocks being levitated up and thrown away the canyon guide stands behind where the rocks used to be
sorry about the wait youngsters whos ready to cross this here canyon
uh one of them i think camera pans left to reveal the zhang and the scout
rushing forward i was here first my partys on their way
i cant guide people who arent here cut to a wider shot showing the zhang filing past the three kids and the fuming gan jin scout
mockingly guess you guys will have to make the trip tomorrow
the shot shifts to a closeup the scout whose eyes twitch in anger the camera zooms backward and pans left to reveal another tribe entering the canyon entrance area the scout points to them in triumph
wait here they come a group of clean finely dressed people are shown coming toward them
to the canyon guide youre not seriously gonna cave into these spoiled gan jins i mean were refugees too and weve got sick people that need shelter
i  uh  well 
weve got old people who are weary from traveling
sick people get priority over old people
maybe you zhangs wouldnt have so many sick people if you werent such slobs
if you gan jins werent so clean you wouldnt live to be so old
over the two arguing tribes well aang ready to put your peacemaking skills to the test
i dont know a fight over chores is one thing but these people have been feuding for a hundred years
stepping forward everybody listen up this is the avatar and if you give him a chance im sure he can come up with a compromise that will make everyone happy
uh you could share the earthbender and travel together
absolutely not wed rather be taken by the fire nation than travel with those stinking thieves
we wouldnt travel with those pompous fools anyway the two tribes begin to shout at each other again
shouting all right heres the deal youre all going down together and appa here will fly your sick and elderly across does that seem fair both leaders nod in agreement and the scene fades to show the sick and elderly boarding appa
to appa sorry appa youll have to do this on your own
aang this feuding tribe stuff is serious business are you sure its a good idea getting involved in this
grinning broadly to tell you the truth im not sure but when have i ever been
hes the avatar sokka making peace between people is his job
dismayed his jobs gonna make us cross this whole canyon on foot isnt it cut to an overhead wide shot of the two tribes and the others
okay now comes the bad news cut to a frontal shot of the guide no food allowed in the canyon it attracts he makes motions with his hands to illustrate the skittery monsters that might lurk in the canyon dangerous predators both tribes yell out in protest
no food this is ridiculous
oh you babies can go a day without food would you rather be hungry or dead he raises an earth pillar to tower over the rest he continues cupping his hands to his mouth to amplify his voice now were heading down in ten minutes all food better be in your gut or in the garbage
the zhang tribe quickly whips out and shoves food into their mouths which stands in stark contrast to the gan jin tribe who eat slowly with chopsticks
to the people on appa appas going to take good care of you till we get there to appa see you on the other side buddy yip yip appa roars and takes off the camera fades to show both groups of people climbing down into the canyon the tour guide earthbends to form a bridge in a gap in the path
nice bending
the jobs much more than bending kid folks want information turns to the travelers many of you are probably wondering how canyons are formed experts tell us this canyon was most likely carved into the ground by earth spirits who were angry at local farmers for not offering them a proper sacrifice
katara and sokka look up in fear as an avalanche of rocks comes falling toward them and the canyon guide earthbends it away from them
he he he guess the spirits are still angry hope you all brought sacrifices
cut to a wide shot of the canyon floor and the canyon wall on the right side of the screen the view pans slowly rightward before cutting to a closer overhead shot of the group now at the bottom of the switchback trail they have just entered the canyon floor the guide stands in front of the two tribes and the kids katara aang and sokka look at each other in exasperation and the scene fades to show them standing at the bottom of the canyon next to a huge boulder
okay everyone stand clear of the wall he throws the boulder and destroys the bridge he had made earlier
whyd you do that
these people are fleeing the fire nation arent they gotta make sure we cant be followed well be safe now yells out as he is picked up by a huge animal aang blows away the dust to reveal a canyon crawler
we gotta help him he throws his boomerang at the crawler which drops the canyon guide and comes after sokka instead okay now we gotta help me katara comes to his aid and does a water whip on the crawler but she is quickly thrown aside aang jumps down and sends a multiple blasts of air at the crawler and drives it away
to the canyon guide what was that
on the ground canyon crawler groans in pain and theres sure to be more
your arms theyre broken
without my arms i got no bending in other words
were trapped in this canyon
the camera fades to show them grouped together
i thought the whole point of ditching our food was so we wouldnt have to deal with things like canyon crawlers
its the zhangs they took food down here even after the canyon guide told them not to
what if theres anyone who cant go without food for a day its you pampered gan jins
i hope youre happy were stuck in this canyon with no way out
why dont you thank yourself food hider
look sticking together is the only way to
im not walking another step with the likes of them
now theres something we can agree on
to the canyon guide any ideas
no bendng  we need to get out of this canyon  i wont die down here i wont become part of the food chain
see were going to become part of the food chain because of you points to zhangs
sure unjustly blame the zhangs like you always do
gladly
angrily enough i thought i could help you guys get along but i guess thats not gonna happen jumps onto a tall rock we should split up gan jins on this side and zhangs on that side well travel in two separate lines the two leaders nod at each other and start walking aang jumps down to sokka and katara sokka you go with the zhangs and katara you go with the gan jins see if you can find out why they hate each other so much
they split up and the camera pans to show them walking separately the scene changes to show sokka in the zhang camp
so you guys arent going to put up your tarps
what for its the dry season
exactly
besides we like to use the tarp as a blanket
smiling finally someone gets it
katara is shown at the gan jin camp where they are putting up tarps over their tents
you really think itll rain
no but you can never be too careful right
katara smiles and the camera fades to nightfall where they are sitting around their campfire the gan jin leader looks around and pulls a piece of bread out of his sleeve katara looks stunned to see all the other tribe members doing the same
would you care for some bread katara
so it was you guys who had food
oh come now you really think that tribe of thieves isnt smuggling food why should my people go hungry when the sneaky zhangs are stuffing their faces
hesitates well i guess its okay if everyones doing it takes the bread and eats it so why does your tribe hate the zhangs so much
you seem like a smart girl katara i bet you would enjoy hearing some history fades to show a large gate with a finely dressed man running toward it voiceover the patriarch of our tribe jin wei was an earthbender warrior who was assigned an important duty transporting our sacred orb from the great eastern gate to the great western gate taking the orb from the east to the west represents the suns rising and setting it was our tribes ancient redemption ritual but as he approached the gate jin wei was attacked by one of the zhang a vermin named wei jin who looked at the orb with envy that coward wei jin knocked jin wei to the ground and stole our sacred orb camera goes back to the gan jin leaders face our people have never forgotten you can never trust a zhang
katara glares at the zhangs camp and the scene fades to show the zhang tribe and sokka sitting around the campfire
to sokka care for some meat
would i takes the meat and bites down hungrily
i know what you must be thinking were horrible for endangering everybody by bringing food down here
hmhmm
the gan jin think so badly of us they probably assumed we brought food in and decided to bring food in themselves thats why we brought food in
still eating hmm
our conflict with the gan jin goes back over a hundred years fades to show a poorlydressed man running through a large gate voiceover our forefather wei jin was leaving the western gate of our village when he saw a figure in the distance it was a man of the gan jin tribe jin wei collapsed on the ground noble wei jin stopped to help him jin wei was transporting a sacred orb a very powerful relic used in his tribes redemption ritual wei jin tried to tend to the mans wounds but jin wei insisted the orb was more important and asked him to take it back to his tribe kind wei jin promised to send help for the man as soon as he could but as wei jin crossed the border to return the orb into gan jin territory he was arrested instead of thanking him for his kind and selfless deed they sentenced him to twenty long years in prison back to zhang leader we zhangs will never forget that injustice
thats just terrible looks at her piece of meat you gonna finish that
fades to show aang sitting with momo far from both camps
sure would be nice to be sitting around one of those campfires telling stories and laughing its okay momo well be out of here soon enough and then we can eat our weight in leechi nuts momo jumps up and snatches a bug out of the air he eats part of it before offering the rest to aang nah ill wait for the leechi nuts
slowly approaching aang lonely isnt it being impartial
i wish i could help these people get along but it just seems impossible anyhow i guess our biggest problem is getting out of here
im not so sure the two problems are unrelated
aang looks away sadly and the scene fades to show the two tribes traveling again in daylight
all clear were almost to the other side
jumps down to katara and sokka katara sokka will these people cooperate long enough to get out of the canyon
i dont think so aang the zhangs really wronged the gan jins they ambushed jin wei and stole the sacred orb
what are you talking about
yeah katara what are you talking about wei jin didnt steal the orb he was returning it to their village gate and was wrongfully punished by the gan jin
not punished enough if you ask me
over sokkas frustrated growls okay okay i get it now i need your help i need everyone together at the base of the canyon wall he takes off on his glider and the scene fades to show him landing between the two tribes please everyone as soon as we get out of here we can eat and then go our separate ways but i need you all to put your heads together and figure out a way up this cliff
maybe the zhang can climb the wall with their long disgusting fingernails
oh sorry i forgot that to the gan jin unclipped fingernails is a crime punishable by twenty years in jail
why you dirty thief
you pompous fool
the tribes began to argue loudly again accompanied by katara and sokka
shouting guys focus how many times do i have to say it harsh words wont solve problems action will
perhaps the avatar is right
yes perhaps he is aang grins happily at this
harsh words will never solve our problems
action will
they both draw their swords and aang yells in surprise as they clash their swords
to the death and let this be the end of this rivalry
you know i take it back harsh words arent so bad
the two leaders ignore him as they begin to fight they are evenly matched and continue until aang blows them apart with a strong gust of air the two tribes go flying backward revealing a large amount of hidden food
shocked is that  food everyone smuggled food down here unbelievable you guys put our lives in danger because you couldnt go without a snack for a day youre all awful he looks in wonder at a custard tart and his stomach growls so hungry is that an egg custard in that tart he turns to see dozens of canyon crawlers approaching and they all try to flee
oh no thats a lot of canyon crawlers
taking out his boomerang we barely survived one
theyre coming back for me theyve had a taste and theyre coming back for me
sokka wait stops him as he runs forward i dont care about this stupid feud i just want us to get out of here alive
me too i only took their side cause they fed me
the camera cuts to show aang fighting off the canyon crawlers and soon has them all in a pile the crawlers pick themselves up and target the refugees though aang katara sokka and the tribe leaders fight hard to hold them off they are vastly out numbered aang looks around to see the crawlers eating the food out of the bags
shouting everybody watch me and do what i do he distracts a crawler with a piece of food leaps on its back and throws a bag over its snout the two tribes mimic him working together now follow me were riding out of this hole aang ties a huge bag of food onto a stick and uses it to guide the crawlers up the canyon wall everyone get off
jumping off a crawler we made it
as soon as all the people have made it up the cliff aang throws the bag back down and the crawlers follow
i never thought a gan jin could get his hands dirty like that
and i never knew you zhangs were so reliable in a pinch
perhaps were not so different after all they both smile at each other and aang sighs in relief
too bad we cant rewrite history you thieves stole our sacred orb from jin wei draws his sword
draws her sword you tyrants unjustly imprisoned wei jin for twenty long years
sighs in frustration wait a second  jin wei wei jin i know those guys
yes yes were all aware of the story
no i mean i really knew them i might not look it but im a hundred and twelve years old i was there one hundred years ago on the day youre talking about scene fades to show the two men facing each other voiceover there seems to be a lot of confusion about what happened first of all jin wei and wei jin werent enemies they were brothers twins in fact and they were eight and most importantly they were just playing a game the sacred orb from the legend that was the ball and the eastern and western gates were the goal posts jin wei had the ball and was running toward the goal when he fell and fumbled it wei jin didnt steal the ball he picked it up and started running it toward the other goal but he stepped out of bounds so the official put him in the penalty box not for twenty long years but for two short minutes fades back to aang there was no stealing and no putting anyone in imprison it was just a game
youre saying the sacred orb was actually a sacred ball
nope just a regular ball
what about our tribes redemption ritual
thats what the game was called redemption as soon as you got the ball from one end to the other everyone would yell redemption the tribe leaders look at each other skeptically dont get me wrong wei jin was kind of a slob and jin wei was a little stuffy that much is true but they respected each others differences enough to share the same playing field
to the gan jin leader i suppose its time we forget the past
bowing and look to the future
the zhang leader bows back and aang looks at them happily the scene fades to show them standing with appa
good to see you boy did you miss me appa licks aang as the gan jin leader approaches
i cannot thank you enough avatar
covered in appas slobber well you know i try
recoils in disgust ugh
fades to show the two tribes standing together
let us travel to the earth kingdom capital as one tribe both tribes cheer as they start walking
running forward im going too im sick of this place
thats some luck you knew jin wei and wei jin
you could call it luck or you could call it lying
flabbergasted what
i made the whole thing up
shocked you did not in devilish admiration that is so wrong
now where is that custard tart im starving
fades to credits
the episode begins in aangs dream the scene itself dominated by a tinge of warm yellow is filled with clouds for a moment before aang slides into the frame of the shot his face happy as he flicks the reins the shot switches to a far view showing that he is riding appa who is flapping his six legs in unison up and down as if he were a bird the camera pans to the right revealing sokka as he pulls alongside appa using aangs glider to fly with the avatar the shot cuts to a closeup of the water tribe warrior as he turns his head toward aang grinning broadly and contentedly at him cut to aang as his face exhibits the same contented grin he turns his attention to his right and the camera follows his gaze revealing katara sitting atop the head of an enormous momo she waves at aang camera moves back to a wide frontal shot of the group coursing leisurely through the open sky
voiceover we need you aang
closeup as he is looking toward katara contentedly i need you too
aang notices something out of the corner of his eyes as he turns toward it his expression changes to shock focusing on aangs face the camera turns 180 degrees and switches to his point of view as the skys coloring changes to a dark ominous gray revealing a churning storm cloud before him cut back to aang who yanks appas reins in fright
alarmed be careful guys he looks to his left and right uneasy guys
the scene rapidly zooms out revealing that aang and appa are alone surrounded by nothing but the darkening sky cut back to aangs point of view as gyatso in lotus floats downward positioning himself in front of aang
surprised gyatso
whispering his tone sad why did you disappear
frontal shot his voice soft and sad i didnt mean to
cut to a sideview of the two monks not a meter apart from one another aang reaches out to gyatso but before he can touch him gyatso turns gray and dissipates into smoke it blows over aang causing him to raise his left arm in front of his face and turn away to shield himself from it frontal shot of aang as the last of the smoke washes over him he peeks over his arm but instantly raises his head his eyes growing big in shock a dark shadow passes over him as the shot cuts to a distant sideview of appa being swallowed by the dark cloud
voiceover we need you aang
a bolt of lightning splits the shot for an instant before cutting to a frontal shot of a screaming and frightened aang wrestling with the reins as he and appa are caught in the belly of the storm with rain beating down on them cut to an underwater shot as aang and appa plummet into the ocean the duo floats for a moment cut to a closeup of aangs hand as his grip on appas reins loosens and they slip from his limp grasp
echoing voiceover we need you aang cut to a downward view of an unconscious aang sinking we need you we need you aang we need you
unmoving aang sinks and disappears into the darkness of the ocean for a fraction of a second lightning splits the shot once again and the silhouette of the fire lord surrounded by flames appears
the scene cuts to reality as aang gasping for air and shooting upright startles momo who was curled up on top of aang momo leaps onto kataras stomach causing her to shoot up with a startled look on her face before jumping on sokkas who shoots up still sleepy halfheartedly wielding his dagger and boomerang
drowsily whats going on he looks around did we get captured again
shot looking down sliding right aang turns to his friends its nothing i just had a bad dream he curls up facing away from them go back to sleep
curls up facing away from aang dont have to tell me twice
frontal shot of aang with katara behind him looking at him in concern are you all right aang
looking lost im okay
you seem to be having a lot of nightmares lately you want to tell me about it
briefly closing his eyes i think i just need some rest
sitting up behind katara upbeat you guys want to hear about my dream katara glares at him an expression sokka returns thats okay i didnt want to talk about it anyway
sokka lies down disappearing from view katara does the same
scene changes to waves crashing on a sandy shore under a blue sky cut to a wide frontal shot of katara as she carries their packs toward appa who yawns as the animal closes its mouth again aang is revealed sitting on his head while sokka sits on the saddle
look at those clear skies buddy pets appas head cut to a close shot as he looks up at a flock of birds arranged in a v flying overhead their gooselike honking audible should be some smooth flying
cut to an overhead shot looking down of katara looking into a bag before holding it upside down sprinkling the ground with crumbs momo instantly eats them sokka walks past her toward appa carrying some of their luggage
looking from the contents of the bag up to aang well we better smoothly fly she steps onto appas tail and walks to the saddle ourselves to a market cause were out of food
sideshot as he suddenly straightens up his tone serious guys wait this was in my dream momo lands on the pack behind him we shouldnt go to the market
shot cuts beside sokka facing out toward katara and aang who turn to look at him curious what happened in your dream
frontal shot his eyes are bugged out in terror and the camera zooms in on him rolling slightly as the shot takes on a greenish tint and alien music dubs the scene food eats people the colors return to normal as the shot cuts to kataras face as she shakes her head behind her aang goes back to adjusting the reins cut to sokka again as he points at momo also momo could talk he glares at momo while crossing his arms you said some very unkind things
momos ears droop as sokka speaks cut to downward looking shot of a flock of birds in vformation flying over the open ocean as the scene pans to the left zukos ship sails into view cut to the deck where iroh stands on the deck with zuko looking through a spyglass behind him as the flight of birds passes over irohs head in the distance he sniffs the air and zuko lowers the spyglass to turn to his uncle who speaks
there is a storm coming a big one
youre out of your mind uncle walking up to iroh the weathers perfect theres not a cloud in sight
the shot cuts behind the two facing the prow of the ship and showing a clear sea and sky
a storm is approaching from the north he turns to face zuko i suggest we alter our course and head southwest
taking a few steps in irohs direction pointing briefly northward we know the avatar is traveling northward so we will do the same
cut to his face stern prince zuko consider the safety of the crew
cut to his face as he advances on his uncle angrily the safety of the crew doesnt matter
behind them lieutenant jee walks onto deck inadvertently overhearing the conversation as zuko realizes jee is behind him and turns to face him his expression briefly loses its raging intensity a quick closeup shows jee raising an eyebrow as zuko walks over to him another cut shifts the view to the lieutenants side as zuko addressing jee directly struts up to him dominantly looking him right in the eyes from a close distance as he finishes speaking
finding the avatar is far more important than any individuals safety
as zuko walks away jee glares after him the shot switches showing zuko leaving the deck through the door at the base of the superstructure cut to a frontal shot of jee who looks slightly enraged as iroh walks over to him
reassuringly a twinge of uncertainty in his voice almost as if he does not fully believe what he is saying he doesnt mean that hes just all worked up
the scene changes to a seaside hamlet built on the side of a cliff face the roofs all tealgreen a collection of houses sits back from the waterfront where a row of warehouses adjoins the docks among the several ships moored on the towns four piers is appa floating in the water by himself cut to katara who stands in front of a small merchants stand suspiciously eying a watermelon
scowling ahhh its good its perfect im telling you
shaking the watermelon which emits an audible sloshing sound i dont know if i like the sound of that swishing
as the shot zooms out the merchant moves around the stand where katara stands sokka and aang staff in hand stand beside them the former is filling a basket with fruit swishing means its ripe its the ripe juices swishing around eh
taking a step toward katara i think its true katara swishing means its ripe
as the shot cuts to a frontal view of her she puts the melon back on the stand i just realized were out of money anyway
annoyed grabbing a basket full of fruits from sokka awww
as sokka walks past the merchant she indignantly kicks him in the rear drawing a cry of pain from sokka cut to sokka katara and aang on the docks sokka is rubbing where the lady kicked him and seems downcast
out of food and out of money now what are we supposed to do
you could get a job smart guy
a fisherman and his wife are walking behind the gang as katara finishes they begin a loud heated conversation which is overheard easily by aang katara and sokka
we shouldnt go out there please the fish can wait theres going to be a terrible storm camera cuts to show aang who appears alarmed by the prediction
youre crazy its a nice day gesturing to the sky with both arms no clouds no winds no nothing so quit your nagging woman
nervously suggesting to katara and sokka maybe we should find some shelter
indicating the fair weather are you kidding shelter from what
my joints say theres going to be a storm a bad one
well its your joints against my brain
then i hope your brain can find someone else to haul that fish cause i aint comin
then ill find a new fish hauler and pay him double what you get cut to a side shot of the couple showing sokka running up to them how do you like that
interrupting raising his hand ill go
youre hired shoots a triumphant look at his wife who scowls back
after a short pause to katara and aang what you said get a job  and hes paying double
rounding on sokka his expression wild double who told you that nonsense
the scene changes to zukos ship on the open ocean as the shot pans right a massive bank of darkening clouds having appeared seemingly out of nowhere rolls into view looming in front of the ship cut to the deck where lieutenant jee and several other soldiers stand a short distance from the shot staring at the clouds zuko walks into the foreground regarding the clouds as jee and the others turn to face him iroh walks between zuko and jee as the latter taunts the former
looks like your uncle was right about the storm after all
pleasantly lucky guess
whirling around and walking toward jee angry lieutenant youd better learn some respect jabs two fingers into jees chest  or i will teach it to you begins to walk away from jee who follows zuko with his eyes continuing his taunting after a short pause
what do you know about respect behind jee irohs expression turns to panic and he makes a cutting motion at his throat with his hand trying to signal lieutenant jee to stop cut to zukos back as he stops walking before switching to his face as he listens to jees words the way you talk to everyone around here from your hardworking crew to your esteemed uncle shows you know nothing about respect cut to a closeup of irohs face as he gasps slightly reaching out a hand in desperation before moving it to his forehead in resignation believing jee has gone too far cut back to zukos face contorted with rage you dont care about anyone but yourself then again what should i expect from a spoiled prince
zuko turns around and extends his right arm as if preparing to firebend lieutenant jee does the same
easy now both zuko and jee wristblock the others arm smoke rises from a furious zukos hand interrupting the staredown iroh extends an arm and pulls theirs apart the smoke fades enough were all a bit tired from being at sea so long im sure after a bowl of noodles everyone will feel much better
lieutenant jee walks away
i dont need your help keeping order on my ship
iroh puts a comforting hand on zukos right shoulder but zuko shrugs it off and walks away scene changes back to a dock at the fishing town where team avatar stands sokka is carrying supplies onto the fishermans boat
sokka maybe this isnt such a good idea look at the sky
i said i was going to do this job i cant back out just because of some bad weather
the boy with the tattoos has some sense you should listen to him
boy with tattoos the fisherman turns around to look at aang airbender tattoos well ill be a hog monkeys uncle youre the avatar aint ya
thats right katara and aang smile

you chose them from among thousands of toys aang the toys you picked were the four avatar relics these items belonged to avatars past your own past lives
i just chose them because they seemed fun
he smiles and pulls the cord on the propeller toy sending the propeller spinning into the air it spins through the air and the scene cuts back to a close view of the five monks the toy goes over monk tashis head
you chose them because they were familiar
normally we would have told you of your identity when you turned sixteen but there are troubling signs storm clouds are gathering
i fear that war may be upon us young avatar
we need you aang
aang lowers his head his responsibility crushing him his head stays lowered as the flashback ends and his head remains lowered in the present as well cut to a wider shot of aang on the left katara on the right the fire between them katara looks upon him with concern and sympathy the scene changes back to zukos ship jee is talking about zuko to a couple other men

cut to a wall of the cave the shot pans down to show katara and a sadlooking aang around their campfire while momo is asleep in his lap aang stares off into the fire with unseeing eyes as he continues his story
then just when i was feeling better something worse happened
scene changes to flashback of monk tashi and monk gyatso speaking to monk pasang
aang needs to have freedom and fun he needs to grow up as a normal boy
you cannot keep protecting him from his destiny
gyatso i know you mean well but you are letting your affection for the boy cloud your judgment
all i want is what is best for him
but what we need is whats best for the world you and aang must be separated the avatar will be sent away to the eastern air temple to complete his training
aang is shown looking through a hole in the ceiling shocked at the news that he just heard
thats awful aang i dont know what to say
stands up how could they do that to me they wanted to take away everything i knew and everyone i loved he activates the avatar state
whoa hot cinders
aang comes out of the avatar state walks to the fire and sits down again

the world needed me and i wasnt there to help
aang 
the fisherman was right i did turn my back on the world
youre being too hard on yourself even if you did run away i think it was meant to be if you had stayed you would have been killed along with all the other airbenders
you dont know that
i know it was meant to be this way the world needs you now you give people hope
scene changes back to zukos ship
when prince zuko saw that it was his father who had come to duel him he begged for mercy
flashback shows a side overview of the agni kai chamber where ozai is advancing on zuko

cut to a frontal view of zhao iroh and azula in the crowd while iroh clenches his teeth and looks fearful and worried on zukos behalf zhao looks on with a smirk on his face while azula smiles and raises her left fist in front of her chest in anticipation
voiceover iroh closes his eyes and averts his head to the left i looked away
as the sound of a fire blast is heard zuko is screaming no which echoes while the faces of the spectators are brightened by the flames the camera slowly zooms in on irohs averted face the scene switches from the past to the present where iroh is sitting in the same manner
i always thought that prince zuko was in a training accident
it was no accident after the duel the fire lord said that by refusing to fight zuko had shown shameful weakness as punishment he was banished and sent to capture the avatar only then could he return with his honor
so thats why hes so obsessed capturing the avatar is the only chance he has of things returning to normal
things will never return to normal but the important thing is the avatar gives zuko hope
scene changes to show zuko meditating while having flashbacks of his younger life he is stopped by a hit on the ship scene changes to aang and katara the fishermans wife appears

the scene opens on a messenger hawk flying toward an imposing fire nation fortress as the scene changes to its tower the camera pans across the trilevel fortress and its tall balconies before settling on a courtyard where a group of archers stand at the ready switch to a closer shot of a single archer the archer draws his bow and releases three times in succession sharply and accurately switch to a shot of the bowmans target the first arrow strikes dead center the second arrow splits the first arrow in half and the third arrow splits the second arrow in half and completely impales the target switch back to a shot of the archers as they draw their bows the camera pans up to a balcony where colonel shinu is arguing heatedly with commander zhao
in response to zhao somewhat angrily absolutely not the yuyan archers stay here your request is denied commander zhao
colonel shinu please reconsider  their precision is legendary the yuyan can pin a fly to a tree from one hundred yards away  without killing it annoyed youre wasting their talents using them as mere security guards
i can do whatever i want with their talents theyre my archers and what i say goes
zhao turns to face the colonel frustrated and angry
but my search for the avatar is
cutting zhao off midsentence while getting close to him and scoffing angrily is nothing but a vanity project were fighting a real war here and i need every man ive got commander
but
furiously thats final i dont wanna hear another word about it
zhao fumes in the background the cry of a messenger hawk is heard camera shifts to an above view and follows a messenger hawk as it reaches colonel shinu shinu opens the container on the hawks back and reads the message inside with a puzzled expression
intrigued news from fire lord ozai
shinu hands zhao the message with irritation zhao takes the message rudely brushing past the colonel as he reads the news zhao smiles smugly
pleased it appears ive been promoted to admiral my request  is now an order
colonel shinu bows respectfully and leaves
shot of the yuyan archers practicing zhao surveys their work with a glad expression playing on his face the camera pans up to the roof of the tower where a mysterious figure in a blue mask is perched seemingly for the entire conversation the masked man disappears into the shadows switch to a shot of a vast mountain range the landscape is blanketed with a ruined city
the scene changes to a shot inside one of the ruined buildings where team avatar has set up camp sokka is lying against appa huddled in his sleeping bag he is coughing and there is sweat on his face
pressing a wet rag onto sokkas forehead this should bring your fever down
you know what i love about appa the most his sense of humor
thats nice ill tell him
appa growls
laughs classic appa
hows sokka doing
not so good being out in that storm really did a number on him
sokka starts sniffing pitifully
i couldnt find any ginger root for the tea but i found a map theres an herbalist institute on top of that mountain we could probably find a cure for sokka there
aang hes in no condition for travel sokka just needs more rest im sure hell be better by tomorrow starts coughing
not you too
relax it was just a little cough im fi she coughs again this time with greater force and lightly groans after
shielding his face thats how sokka started yesterday now look at him he thinks hes an earthbender
delirious take that you rock he flails his arms as if he is hitting something
a few more hours and youll be talking nonsense too im going to go find some medicine he grabs his glider and begins to head out just as a flash of lightning strikes uh maybe its safer if i go on foot to appa and momo keep an eye on them guys appa groans while momo chitters
ha ha you guys are killing me
aang jumps and uses airbending to help him run faster the scene switches to prince zukos ship
we havent been able to pick up the avatars trail since the storm but if we continue heading northeast  a larger fire nation ship pulls up next to theirs
what do they want
perhaps a sporting game of pai sho
a soldier from the other ship walks in
to zuko the hunt for the avatar has been given prime importance all information regarding the avatar must be reported directly to admiral zhao
zhao has been promoted well good for him as iroh makes a move in his pai sho game another player slaps his hand against his own forehead as if he lost
looking down ive got nothing to report to admiral zhao now get off my ship and let us pass
admiral zhao is not allowing ships in or out of this area
off my ship
iroh wins his game excellent i take the pot a crew member punches himself but youre all improving im certain you will win if we play again
the scene switches to a hidden outpost one soldier is looking at aangs wanted poster while the other is on watch duty
reading aangs wanted poster out loud says here that the avatar can create tornadoes and run faster than the wind pretty amazing
ah thats just a bunch of fire lord propaganda theres no way thats true
the scout returns to his task and sees a cloud moving swiftly along the ground which turns out to be aang aang runs by wrecking the outpost on accident one of the scouts blows a horn signaling that aang has been spotted
the scene changes back to the gangs camp
weakly katara please water
also weak listen carefully momo holds up a water skin i need you to take this to the river and fill it with water she is shown through momos eyes speaking gibberish got it momo takes the skin and flies off
aang runs up the stairs and enters the green house
speaking fast hello im sorry to barge in like this but i need some medicine for my friends they have fevers and they were coughing gets cut off by the herbalist

turning back desperation and fear on his face how uncle with zhaos resources its just a matter of time before he captures the avatar turns back out to sea and whispers my honor my throne my country im about to lose them all
cut back to an exterior shot of the herbalist institute followed by a shot of the old woman in front of some bushes
ah plum blossom she plucks a flower from the tree
he lifts up his head off the table finally closeup of the mixing bowl as the herbalist drops the flower into the mixture and aang grabs for the bowl thanks for all your help
the scene moves back just as aang wants to yank the bowl out of the herbalists hands and she slaps his hands roughly away with her spoon
hands off
ow
closeup holding her spoon at the ready for a new attack what do you think youre doing
rubs his hand flinching taking the cure to my friends
lowers her spoon laughs this isnt a cure its miyukis dinner plum blossom is her favorite
what about my friends
well all they need are some frozen wood frogs theres plenty down in the valley swamp
confused what am i supposed to do with frozen frogs
why suck on them of course
shocked and disgusted his eye twitches suck on them
the frog skin excretes a substance that will cure your friends be sure to get plenty because once those little critters thaw out theyre useless
youre insane arent you
crazily thats right well dont stand there all day go
aang runs out and the storm gets worse he wipes his face from the excessive rainfall several arrows comes out of nowhere and pins aangs pants to the ground he airbends a shield sending some off them away aang removes one
uh  i think you dropped this  screams as he sees the yuyan archers taking aim at him panicking he frees himself from the arrow that had pinned his foot to the ground and runs he falls off a cliff into a swamp and finds the frozen frogs a frog
aang sticks the frog in his shirt and manages to get four more before getting one of his sleeves pinned to a rock aang waterbends an ice wall in front of himself an arrow strikes the wall before two more land in the same spot and slice the arrows that came before it the ice cracks and another set of arrows pin his other sleeve before a net is launched at him
the scene cuts to show aang bounded at his legs and arms with chains barely able to move he looks angry and struggles against the chains
so this is the great avatar master of all the elements i dont know how youve managed to elude the fire nation for a hundred years but your little game of hide and seek is over
angry ive never hidden from you untie me and ill fight you right now
uhh no tell me how does it feel to be the only airbender left do you miss your people aang looks down sadly dont worry you wont be killed like they were aang looks angry again see if you die you will just be reborn and the fire nation would have to start searching all over again so ill keep you alive but just barely aang takes a deep breath and blows at gale force at zhao who falls over blow all the wind you want but your situation is futile there is no escaping this fortress and no one is coming to rescue you
zhao exits the room with the door slamming behind him back to katara and sokka snuggled up in their sleeping bags which lie between appas feet sokka has a coughing fit
weakly water 
weakly momo should be back any minute
momo jumps into the shot chittering happily he jumps up close to katara he drops a dead mouse on to her chest she looks at it in disgust
weakly in disgust ugh no momo water water momos ear go straight up he jumps off her and scampers aang what in the world is taking you so long
the scene changes to an overhead shot of aang still bound between the pillars still trying to get out of the chains the scene changes again to several exterior night shots of the fortress culminating in a long shot of the blue spirit the camera zooms in three step changes to a closeup of the blue spirit who moves left cut to a view of the road leading to the fortress where a wagon is making its way toward the gate cut to a view of the undercarriage of the wagon as it passes the blue spirit is holding on to the underside of the wagon the wagon reaches the gate

as zhao speaks various shots are seen of the blue spirit steadily and stealthily infiltrating the fortress cut back to aang still struggling fruitlessly against his chains he finally stops breathing heavily its useless suddenly frogs start leaping out of his shirt
to the frogs what no dont leave frogs my friends are sick and they need you please go back to being frozen
he begins to struggle again as the frogs hop away toward the door croaking cut to the four guards standing outside the chamber they begin to look confused when they hear croaking they look down to see the frogs coming from underneath the door suddenly they look up as a fire nation soldiers helmet comes bouncing down the corridor toward them one of the guards walks up the corridor and turns right at the first junction disappearing from view a gout of flame erupts from the cross hallway as well as the sound of a brief scuffle two more guards go up to the junction and turn right firebending stances at the ready cut to a view looking down the cross hallway the first guard who went is hanging from the ceiling tied up shift to the hanging soldier and pan up to reveal the blue spirit on the ceiling above the two new combatants he drops down and melee begins but it is over quickly cut back to the last guards where they now see the blue spirit at the junction
cut to a view of the door to aangs chamber the lone guard grabs the alarm horn next to him but a knife knocks it out of his hand the guard lets loose a gout of flame at the blue spirit as he runs down the hall toward the door but the intruder extinguishes the blast with a bucket of water and proceeds to sweeps the guards feet out from under him with the empty bucket cut to aang still struggling inside the chamber he stops and looks at the noises of violence coming from through door these stop abruptly and are replaced by the sound of the lock turning in the door the door opens and the blue spirit enters he brandishes two curved swords and runs forward to aang who screams in fear the blue spirit approaches and two sword cuts are heard aang pulls his arms back in surprise  the blue spirit has freed him he looks at his liberator in wonder the blue spirit comes closer and cuts his remaining bonds turns and walks back toward the door
who are you whats going on are you here to rescue me the blue spirit opens the door and motions for him to follow ill take that as a yes
aang follows him out past the gagged and tied guard at the door to his chamber he hears frog noises and turns to see his halffrozen frogs crawling on the floor
my frogs come back and stop thawing out the blue spirit comes back picks him up by the collar and carries him out wait my friends need to suck on those frogs
meanwhile back at the rundown temple momo has succeeded in piling up mountains of junk around katara but no water momo returns again with a crown
with a weak sickly voice how many times do i have to tell you momo we need water water oh forget it aang please hurry
delirious whos this aang kid you keep talking about your highness katara gets an annoyed look on her face
scene shifts back to a few exterior shots of the fortress before switching to aang and the blue spirit walking silently in the sewer system underneath the fortress soldiers walk back and forth above them they hope out of a grate and into one of the courtyards cut to zhao walking in one of the torchlit corridors of the fortress followed by a scribe
i want a full transcription of my speech sent to the fire lord along with glowing testimonials from all of the ranking officers present and 
he cuts himself off as he hears moans cut to zhaos right where the soldiers that the blue spirit tied still lie zhao upset slams open the door to aangs prison cell it is empty except for a frog which croaks at him from the floor zhao turns in anger and leaves the scribe in tow
sir should i hold off sending that speech to the fire lord
cut back to the two wouldbe escapees who are now scaling a rope on the innermost wall of the fortress they are spotted and the view zooms out as one of the guards shouts
there on the wall
a soldier appears at the top of the wall they are climbing he cuts the rope and the pair fall down the wall aang screaming cut to sideview where aang airbends them to a soft landing when the dust clears the blue spirit unsheathes his swords and they run cut to zhao on the ornate balcony
shouting the avatar has escaped close all the gates immediately cut to the escapees running aang passes the blue spirit
stay close to me
the third gate is closing in front of them as are the two beyond it and it is blocked by many soldiers aang airbends a blast of air that blows them out of the way aang makes for the gate but the blue spirit gets involved in melee and has to stop and fend them off aang turns to see the blue spirit in trouble he grabs a spear from a guard near him airbends him out of the way spins it around and breaks the head off the spear on the ground and launches back into battle to save his new friend the gate closes behind him the blue spirit is surrounded but aang airbends them all out of the way with a mighty effort he catapults the blue spirit to the top of the third wall
he is instantly surrounded but aang appears using the stick as a helicopter blade he plucks the blue spirit off the wall and heads into the next courtyard cut to a closeup of aang struggling to keep them aloft the blue spirit uses his swords to knock the spears sent up at them by the guards they barely next the top of the next wall as they crash unceremoniously onto the battlement aangs stick goes spinning away as guards instantly rush them aang runs for his stick but a guard stops him taking several swings at aang with his sword the blue spirit throws the guard over the wall aang airbends the other guards off the wall
cut to a wide shot of the second wall where more soldiers are scaling ladders aang and the blue spirit knock off the soldiers as they reach the top with two mighty blasts aang depopulates the two scaling ladders nearest him as the blue spirit knocks the one final soldier off his aang brings over his two scaling ladders and steps onto the one the blue spirit has just emptied he hands one ladder to the blue spirit
take this jump on my back
the blue spirit complies and aang begins to use the ladders as massive stilts shedding one each time a step is taken cut to a wide shot of the second courtyard where dawn is approaching in the background the first ladder shed still has some fire nation soldiers on it but it falls into the dust
give me the next one
the blue spirit again complies cut to the bottom of their final stilt where a fire nation soldier sends a gout of flame up the ladder it is too late though as aang and the masked man jump from the last stilt and just manage to grab the edge of the final wall they are unable to hold on however and fall to the ground the blue spirit draws his swords four firebenders unleash their flame on them but aang puts the masked man behind him and airbends the flames away
hold your fire the avatar must be captured alive
the blue spirit instantly comes up behind aang and crosses his swords in front of aangs throat surprising him cut to a view behind the escapees that pans right slowly accenting the standoff before cutting to the implacable blue mask of the intruder cut back to a close of zhaos eyes
through gritted teeth open the gate
admiral what are you doing
let them out now
the gate is opened and the blue spirit backs out with his captives swords still at his throat cut back to zhao the officer questioning him still visible over his left shoulder
how could you let them go
a situation like this requires  precision
the blue spirit continues backing away from the fortress zhao now looks on from the top of the main gate cut to an arrow being strung on a bow by an unseen soldier cut back to zhao who looks to his right as he speaks
do you have a clear shot
cut to a yuyan archer who is silent but aims

the episode opens to a sunny lake scene aang katara and sokka are sitting around a bundle of sticks with a blue tent behind katara and are surrounded by trees and rocks a large se tu suddenly bursts from the surface leaps through the air and lands with a splash into the water katara rises and points at it
excitedly look
sokka rises to view the spectacle the fish a se tu leaps into the air again facing the group in midjump in slowmotion before landing in the water again the camera cuts to sokka and katara
he is taunting us camera zooms out to the lake and the groups camp site you are so going to be dinner
he grabs his fishing pole from his tent set up nearby and attempts to cast the pole into the water unsuccessfully
observes the fishing pole hey wheres the fishing line
sheepishly oh i didnt think you would need it sokka he holds up an intricately woven necklace decorated with a red flower
walks over and examines the necklace aw its all tangled
rises to his feet not tangled woven i made you a necklace katara i thought since you lost your other one 
he pauses in midsentence and displays the necklace holding it between his hands as he flashes a toothy grin
smiling and approaching him thanks aang takes the necklace i love it
sarcastically great aang maybe instead of saving the world you can go into the jewelrymaking business
i dont see why i cant do both
while saying this katara can be seen in the background trying on her new necklace sokka turns back to the lake where the se tu continues its acrobatic display sokka tosses the fishing line into the water in an attempt to spear the fish he only grows more frustrated when he sees the se tu leap from the water unharmed
stop taunting me
he runs into the water holding his jawbone dagger aang watches him run off
offcamera so how do i look
aang turns to look at her a bored expression on his face his uninterested expression however soon transforms into one of awe and amazement the camera focuses on katara panning upward from her feet to her head the background around her has become colored with shades of pink and purple sparkles of light glistening every now and then the panshot reveals her smiling sweetly blushing slightly with one hand behind her back and the other touching her necklace in a pose the scene cuts to aang who nervously pulls at his collar with his hand smiling awkwardly
nervously you mean all of you or just your neck puts his right hand behind his head in embarrassment i mean because both look great
emerges from the water holding the se tu smoochie smoochie someones in love makes kissing noises before the se tu breaks free from his grasp slapping sokka in the face with its tail and disappearing under the water
embarrassed i  well uh 
annoyed stop teasing him sokka aangs just a good friend pats the side of his head a sweet little guy just like momo pets momo who lands on aangs shoulder
dismayed thanks
sokka emerges emptyhanded from the lake soaking wet and cross momo suddenly flies off aangs shoulder upon hearing a loud noise in the distance he leaps onto a rock followed by aang who observes the scene he points to the source of the commotion
urgently someones being attacked by a platypus bear
the camera focuses on a large ferocious creature having dark brown fur the body and head of a bear the tail and bill of a platypus and bearing a white v across its chest the creature stands upright on its hind legs and swings at a man clad in blue who smiles merrily his hands behind his back the man manages to avoid the bears swing by calmly stepping backward the creature continues its attacks as aang leaps onto a rock directly behind it the camera focuses on the calm man who continues to smile as though nothing is occurring
well hello there dodges another swift swing of the bears claws nice day isnt it
make noise hell run off
sokka and katara approach the scene
no play dead hell lose interest
the bear swings its claws only to miss striking the man once again
happily whoa close one laughs bemusedly
cups a hand to her mouth and makes gestures with her other hand run downhill then climb a tree
no punch him in the bill swings a fist upward
and then run in zigzags
no need its going to be fine
the platypus bear attempts to land a blow cutting a large chunk of wood from the trunk of a nearby tree the calm dodging the attack aang leaps into the air and lands onto the ground placing himself between the calm man and the platypus bear he sends the creature back slightly with an air blast
holding his hands out in front of him and assuming a fighting stance whoa there
the platypus bear only rears up on its hind legs further letting out a loud cry appa suddenly appears from behind the bear and bellows causing the animal to bristle in fear the bear lays a large spotted egg and escapes the scene swimming down the river
joyfully picks up the egg mmm lunch he sniffs it lucky for you we came along
thanks but everything was already under control not to worry aunt wu predicted id have a safe journey folds hands together and bows slightly
aunt who

but the fortuneteller was wrong you didnt have a safe journey you were almost killed
cheerfully but i wasnt all right have a good one he bids them a farewell and begins to walk away only to turn back again oh and aunt wu said if i met any travelers to give them this
he hands aang a wrapped parcel seemingly containing a long thin object and leaves mysteriously sokka eyes the man suspiciously
excitedly maybe we should go see aunt wu and learn our fortunes it could be fun
oh come on fortune telling is nonsense
aang quickly unwraps the mysterious parcel which turns out to be a red umbrella he opens it and holds it over his head
what do you know an umbrella
at that moment the sky darkens and it begins to rain a low rumble of thunder can be heard katara bends an arched shield of water over her head to shelter herself from the weather
that proves it she ducks under the umbrella
holding egg above his head to shield himself from the rain no it doesnt you cant really tell the future
smugly i guess youre not really getting wet then
sokka suddenly loses his grip on the platypus egg as it flies through the air he attempts to catch it however it merely flies a few feet into the air and lands on his head cracking and causing the egg to run down his face cut to the group walking along the path as the rain continues aang and katara are sheltered under the umbrella while sokka stays away from them drenched by the downpour
crossly of course she predicted it was going to rain the skys been gray all day
just admit you might be wrong and you can come under the umbrella
look im going to predict the future now stops walking and hops from foot to foot in an exaggerated way its going to keep drizzling the rain continues to fall see
suddenly the rain stops falling and sky lightens up slightly cut to a shot of aang and katara aang titling the umbrella back to observe the dramatic change in weather
not everyone has the gift sokka
the camera cuts to a sideview of the entire team walking along the path in a strong yet calm breeze which rustles the grass on the side of the path aang and katara continue to stroll leisurely under the umbrella ahead of sokka appa plods behind pausing briefly to shake his wet fur out soaking sokka in the process and causing him to flinch
disgusted agh

trying to contain her laughter is that the bigeared guy who aunt wu predicted youd marry
embarrassed by this statement meng pushes the woman aside and continues on her way to the other room she approaches the team her eyes fixated hopefully on aang who stares off into space unaware of her presence she suddenly trips aang attempts to help her recover accidentally holding her hands in his in the process the two stare at each other for a moment meng blushes

sokka enters the shot and proceeds to lay down in front of the campfire interrupting katara maybe we should all get some sleep
sokka pulls a blanket over himself fade to a shot of aang lying on one of appas legs
the episode opens in a forest while momo suddenly appears jumping from a tree to another tree a mysterious figure is seen following him and momo lands on a roadside kiosk while team avatar is arriving at it
walking toward a poster on the kiosk present in the middle of a crossroad this should give us a good idea of whats around here
flips a small pouch to find it empty aside from a few crumbs see if you can find a menu im starving wipes his mouth
i bet well find something to eat here pointing at the poster the fire days festival momo jumps down aang begins readingout the poster fire nation cultural exhibits jugglers benders magicians  turns to katara this would be a great place for me to study some real firebenders
looking at another poster on the other side of the kiosk seriously you might wanna rethink that look at this
comes over to at the poster hey a poster of me
a wanted poster this is bad aang removes the poster from the wall and starts reading it
stares at the wanted poster i think we better keep moving
looking at katara i have to learn firebending at some point and this could be my only chance to watch a masters up close
swayed by aang while her head is bowed i guess we could go check it out aang begins rejoicing
moves in front of katara in an opposing tone what you wanna walk into a fire nation town where theyre all firedup with their  you know fire aang becomes serious again
starts walking toward appa and is followed by aang well wear disguises and if it looks like trouble well leave
not convinced sarcastically yeah because we always leave before we get into trouble
to appa and momo you guys stay out of sight here while we go to the festival to katara and sokka ready disguises
sokka and katara put on their black cloaks while aang pulls his orange shawl over his head with a smile on his face making him look ridiculous
sarcastically at aangs goofy disguise its like youre a whole different person  katara giggles
lets go
the gang looks around seeing everyone in masks
i think we need some new disguises
where are we gonna get masks like that
get your genuine fire festival masks here
that was surprisingly easy
the gang chooses three masks katara chooses a lady with makeup sokka a blue smiling mask with petals around the rim and aang who chooses a red mask with a frown on it katara removes sokkas mask revealing him to be frowning and aangs mask revealing him to be the one smiling she places sokkas original mask over aangs face and aangs over sokka
hey theres some food
finally to the shop keeper what do you have
flaming fire flakes best in town
ill takeem
sokka gobbles down the fire flakes but has a spasm from the spiciness
aaahhh hot hot
sarcastically flaming fire flakes hot what do you know
hey look at this
dont worry loyal citizens no one can surprise the fire lord
as an earth kingdom general puppet pops up behind the fire lords puppet with a rock ready to attack oh no look out the puppet breaths fire burning the other puppet
aang hold on where are we going
i dont know but theres a big crowd so it must be good
sarcastically knowing the fire nation its probably an execution
i gotta learn that trick
thank you for my next trick i need a volunteer from the audience
waving his hand up in the air all around childishly oh oh me me
in a stern tone while pulling his arm down what do you think youre doing
i want to get a closer look
its better that we dont attract any attention to ourselves
how about you little lady
while backing away uh
awww shes shy leeets give her some encouragement folks
in a jealous tone while folding his arms awww that couldve been me
this next trick is called taming the dragon while sitting her down in a chair and tying her to it you will be my captured princess dont worry young maiden i will tame this fiery beast its too strong i cant hold it
we gotta help her
no we dont want to make a scene
the rope its breaking aang saves katara with his airbending dispersing the flames is a ray of colors while he loses his mask in the process hey you tryin to upstage me kid
aang starts doing a goofy dance as everyone boos at him for ruining the trick
hey that kids the avatar aang stops dancing and runs
i think its time to go
follow me i can get you outta here the kids follow chey
there they are
chey throws a series of explosives at the fire nation soldiers that are chasing them
over there
im calling appa aang blows his whistle
i hope he can really hear that bison whistle
making a sharp turn down one of the several alleys this way comes running back okay not this way
they make another turn but the way they came is blocked by guards chey throws another smoke bomb and runs past them into another alley they group comes across another dead end where there is an enormous supply of fireworks cut to an overhead shot that reveals appa has arrived in the nick of time
appa down here
appa lands between the kids and the guards with his backside facing the guards appa airbends a gale force wind which results in the guards getting blown out of sight as the guards run back into the alley appa has already taken off cut to chey he bites the top off a bomb to light it he throws it at the fireworks supply and it blows up creating a beautiful display of fireworks cut to chey removing his hood as they cruise away
nice touch setting off the fireworks
impressed you really know your explosives 
im familiar
youre a fire nation soldier
was my names chey
the group lands and makes camp
i serve a man more than a man really hes a myth but hes real a living legend jeong jeong the deserter he was a fire nation general or wait was he an admiral
not amused he was very highly ranked we get it
yeah way up there but he couldnt take the madness any more hes the first person ever to leave the army  and live im the second but you dont get to be a legend for that thats okay though jeong jeongs a firebending genius some say hes mad  but hes not hes enlightened
you mean theres a firebender out here whos not with the fire lord gets up in excitement weve gotta go see him he can train me
snaps at aang were not gonna go find some crazy firebender
annoyed stands up to gesture hes not crazy hes a genius and hes the perfect person to train the avatar thats why i followed you into the festival
look thanks for the help but were leaving for the north pole in the morning
sokka this could be my only chance to meet a firebending master who would actually be willing to teach me
it cant hurt just to talk to him
very annoyed thats what you said about going to the festival why doesnt anyone ever listen to me
as sokka turns to pout he almost runs right into a spear in a flash they are surrounded by men wearing straw hats light armor wearing tribal make up and wielding spears
dont move
the tribal folks escort them to their settlement
angry jeong jeong told you not to look for avatar
hold on you know these guys
oh yeh lin yees an old buddy right lin yee
not amused with chey shut up keep moving
down the hill there is a little cottage with leaves and logs
go on he sees you only
oh thats okay we can chat later
is that where jeong jeong is i need to talk to him right away
aang tries to move forward but it stopped by a spear shaft
no you wait there pushes chey forward go now
dont worry everythingll be fine hes a great man great man
chey walks toward jeong jeongs cottage back in the fire days festival in the now deserted central square of the town where some guards are being interrogated by admiral zhao who is accompanied by a few guards himself
so the avatar was here and you let him slip away
anxiously yes sir but other than that the festival went off without a hitch a huge piece of burning planks of wood falls in the background with a massive crash making the guards twitch no fights theft was way down
irritated i dont care about your local crime rates which way did they go
they headed into the forest up the river i suspect
ready the river boats were going after the avatar
back in the settlement chey exits jeong jeongs cottage he arrives back where aang and the others are fast asleep everyone wakes up instantly as chey approaches
what happened can i see jeong jeong now
looking downcast he wont see you hes very angry that i brought you here he wants you to leave immediately
finally lets hit the road he stretches back out again
why wont he see me
he says youre not ready says you havent mastered waterbending and earthbending yet
shocked wait how does he know that
he saw the way you walked into camp he could tell
im going in anyway
aang walks to jeong jeongs cottage he takes a deep breath parts the curtain and walks into the darkness cut to a dark figure seated cross legged amidst a semicircle of candles his back to aang
get out
master i need to learn firebending
only a fool seeks his own destruction
to jeong jeong im the avatar its my destiny to gets interrupted
destiny what would a boy know of destiny if a fish lives its whole life in this river does he know the rivers destiny no only that it runs on and on out of his control he may follow where it flows but he cannot see the end he cannot imagine the ocean
okay but its the avatars duty to master all of the bending disciplines
to master the bending disciplines you must first master discipline itself but you have no interest in this so i have no interest in you now get out
please i have to learn this could be my only chance
are you deaf how can i teach you if you refuse to listen before learning firebending you must learn water and earth water is cool and soothing earth is steady and stable but fire fire is alive it breathes it grows without the bender a rock will not throw itself but fire will spread and destroy everything in its path if one does not have the will to control it that is its destiny you are not ready you are too weak
at this final gesture the candles around jeong jeong violently flame up to illuminate the entire hut before quickly going out a vision in front of jeong jeong begins as one candle is seen lit in front of the firebender a tree is in the background behind the deserter in front of him stands avatar roku
you think i am weak
avatar roku no no i did not mean that
i have mastered the elements a thousand times in a thousand lifetimes now i must do it once again you will teach the avatar he raises his hand and ignites the tree behind jeong jeong firebending
yes yes i will teach you
really thats great raises his hands happily jeong jeong groans in dismay fearing this may not end well
in the morning outside of jeong jeongs cottage sokka is sitting on a boulder by the river fishing the screen pans up the river where katara is practicing waterbending before switching to aang and jeong jeong in front of the cottage aang stands bandy legged on a flat stone in the river jeong jeong stands a foot or two away on the bank in front of his cottage
widen your stance wider bend your knees now concentrate aang expresses his concentration good good
wait what do i do now
turns around silence talking is not concentrating look at your friend is she talking points at sokka even that oaf knows to concentrate on what hes doing
annoyed hey
but what am i concentrating on
feel the heat of the sun it is the greatest source of fire yet it is in complete balance with nature
so when do i get to make some fire
concentrate
aang breathes and is embarrassed as his friends laugh at him from behind he turns to look at them but they stop instantly as he tries to innocent cut to a long shot of the figures in the distance climbing the slope of a mountain cut to a closeup shot of aang and jeong jeong walking up the path to the mountains summit
are we coming up here so i dont burn anything with my fire blasts
no fire yet
what
power in firebending comes from the breath that is why you must master proper breath control
you brought me up here to breathe
assume your stance
aang assumes the proper stance
faces the opposite direction of aang wider
youre not even look interrupted by jeong jeong
wider now inhale through the nose and exhale through the mouth  without talking good keep going
jeong jeong walks down the path and out of the frame as aang continues to breathe a look of fierce concentration on his face cut to a view of aangs lower body as he parts the curtain into jeong jeongs cottage
what are you doing here i did not tell you to stop
ive been breathing for hours
you want to stop breathing
i want you to stop wasting my time i already know how to squat and breathe and feel the sun wiggles fingers to the ceiling to gesture this i wanna know how to shoot fire out of my fingertips
sighs gruffly i had a pupil once who had no interest in learning discipline he was only concerned with the power of fire  how he could use it to destroy his opponents and wipe out the obstacles in his path but fire is a horrible burden to bear its nature is to consume and without control it destroys everything around it while he was speaking the camera cuts to zhao on his boat several men attack him but he fends them off easily leaving a fire in his wake cuts back to jeong jeong
learn restraint or risk destroying yourself and everything you love
after several hours jeong jeong finds aang in front of the hut meditating
i thought about what you said i promise ill be more patient
were going to work with fire now
oh yeah aang gets excited and airbends himself into the air he quickly gets serious again i mean let us begin
jeong jeong grabs a falling leaf and burns the center
concentrate on the fire i want you to keep the flame from reaching the edges of the leaf for as long as you can
master there is trouble
whats going on
concentrate on your leaf
annoyed this is the worst firebending instruction ever all he does is leave me for hours to concentrate or breathe
im sure theres a good reason
but im ready to do so much more
aang remembers to concentrate on his leaf and gets into a stance and breaths moments later the leaf burns up creating a small flame
excited i did it i made fire
aang thats great but you should take it slow
aang starts playing with it by tossing it back and forth from in front to behind himself he makes a blast go in the opposite direction
now thats some firebending
aang youll hurt yourself
i wonder how that juggler did it
aang tosses it into the air and spreads his arms out for a second he has a smile on his face but it vanishes as he accidentally burns kataras hands katara shrieks in pain
katara im so sorry
sokka comes running to kataras side
concerned katara whats wrong angrily what did you do
im sorry it was an accident
sokka tackles aang
i told you we shouldnt mess around with this look what you did you burned my sister katara runs away you burned my sister as jeong jeong walks in this is all your fault
i know now pack your things you must leave immediately
katara runs off
im sorry i didnt  sokka runs off im sorry jeong jeong looks at aang displeased
the scene cuts to katara who is sulking by a creek due to the pain of her burns she dips her hands in they glow briefly and a few seconds later her hands are healed
you have healing abilities the great benders of the water tribe sometimes have this ability ive always wished i were blessed like you  free from this burning curse
but youre a great master you have powers that i will never know
water brings healing and life but fire brings only destruction and pain it forces those of us burdened with its care to walk a razors edge between humanity and savagery eventually we are torn apart
suddenly the water is front of them is blasted with flames jeong jeong gets up and gets into a defensive bending stance and breaks the flames that wash over him and katara the screen changes to a frontal shot of zhaos riverboats coming toward them before switching back to katara and jeong jeong
go get your friends and flee do not come back here or you will all be destroyed hurry
jeong jeong faces the boats that land harmlessly around him the screen shows zhao looking ahead through a telescope from the main deck of his ship he lowers it and smiles the screen goes back to jeong jeong produces a large wall of fire in front of the ships an overhead shot of the ships is shown the boats turn to land on the beach the screen goes back to the front of the beach zhao comes into view
dont worry men my old teacher gave up fighting a long time ago the screen pans to jeong jeong suddenly zhao parts through the wall havent you master jeong jeong
the screen goes for a close of jeong jeongs face and a wide shot as he drops the wall of fire cut to katara running up to where sokka is preparing appa to leave
katara are you all right
im fine weve got to get out of here wheres aang sokka gestures to the cottage
katara enters the cottage to find aang sulking
jeong jeong tried to tell me that i wasnt ready i wouldnt listen im never going to firebend again
youll have to eventually
no never again
its okay aang im healed
surprised what how
ill explain later but right now we have to get out here zhao and his soldiers are attacking
gets on his feet where
by the river they captured jeong jeong
i have to help him
the screen switches to an overhead shot of the beach zhao and his men stand against jeong jeong before cutting to a closer shot
look at you you were once so great i cant believe my former master has become nothing more than a simple savage
it is you who have embraced savagery zhao
its admiral zhao now
that title will not help you against the avatar do not try to fight him you are no match
amused i think i can handle a child
i have never seen such raw power 
jeong jeong
well see men take the deserter
cut to overhead shot of jeong jeong surrounded by five firebenders aang tops short in horror as they close in jeong jeong smirks and wraps himself in a ball of flames when the flames completely dissipates jeong jeong is nowhere to be seen
angry its a trick hes run off into the woods find him faces aang lets find out what my old master has taught you
shocked you were jeong jeongs student
until i got bored
zhao throws a fireball at aang
i see he taught you how to duck and run like a coward but i doubt he showed you what a firebender is truly capable of throws another intense fireball
whoa wild shot
roars with rage ill show you wild
aang looks over to the side where zhao just burned
no selfcontrol  gets an idea
stand and fight avatar
mockingly oh were we fighting i thought you were just getting warmed up
burns in anger at the remark i was  shoots another fireball
zhao fires many more fireballs which all miss
is that all you got man theyll make anyone an admiral these days nearly gets blasted aang cups his hands over his to sound louder ahoy moons zhao with pants up im admiral zhao zhao gets even angrier and aang nearly gets blasted again i dont know why but i thought youd be better than zuko aang looks disappointed when he says this his eyes go wide and he lies down on the deck fast enough to avoid being burnt mocking zhaos firebending sloppy very sloppy
nowhere to run now you little smart mouth
having dodged a series of blasts from zhao on several ships youve lost this battle
enraged disbelief are you crazy you havent thrown a single blow
no but you have he gestures around all the boats are on fire and sinking jeong jeong said you had no restraint jumps in the water have a nice walk home
aang come on lets go
cut a shot from behind aang who is now looking at the river bank beach aang hops on appa and they fly away
wait wheres jeong jeong
he disappeared they all did
walks into the now abandoned village not amused hey where did everybody go sarcastically very funny guys
aang youre burned let me help you katara heals the burn on aangs arm
wow thats good water
when did you learn that
i guess i always knew
sarcastically oh  well then thanks for all the first aid over the years like when i fell into the greaseberry bramble angrily or that time i had two fishhooks in my thumb
shocked two
amused he tried to get the first fishhook out with another fishhook
still being sarcastic oh and the time that mink snake bit me thanks for healing that up that was great really helpful
fade to credits
the episode begins with the gang sitting around a camp site with several other groups listening to a man telling a story of airbenders
dramatically out of view so travelers the next time you think you hear a strange large bird talking take a closer look it might not be a giant parrot but a flying man a member of a secret group of air walkers who laugh at gravity and laugh at those bound to the earth by it
cuts to a wide shot showing the gang and the other travelers surrounding a small campfire the storyteller having finished his story is going around collecting coins from the other travelers arent airbender stories the greatest talking to katara and sokka who are sitting next to him
excitedly was it realistic is that how it was back then
cuts to the three kids
i laugh at gravity all the time chuckling to himself gravity
arrives in front of the gang having already collected money from the rest of the audience jingle jingle jingles the hat in front of sokka asking for money
sokka searches inside his heavy cloak and manages to pull out a bug a worm and a few crumbs
sorry 
upset and somewhat downcast aww cheapskates walks away as sokka puts the bugs back in his pocket
aang stands up and runs after the storyteller who is kneeling in front of an old man
happily hey thanks for the story
holds out his cap tell it to the cap boy
the storyteller shakes his cap behind him as he kneels in front of an old man the shaking causes a coin to come loose and fall from the cap as aang searches his clothes for some money momo picks up the coin and puts it in the cap as the storyteller turns around
aww much obliged little batthing he pets momo on the head
having given up trying to find a coin it means a lot to hear airbender stories it must have been a hundred years ago your great grandpa met them
confused what are you prattling about child great grandpappy saw the air walkers last week he indicates to the old man he was kneeling in front of before the old man makes a sound in his throat akin to a laugh and waves a greeting to aang the shot cuts to aang who has a shocked and disbelieving expression
the scene changes from the campsite to a shot of clouds and appa flying above them
sitting on appas neck steering he is talking to katara and sokka who are riding in appas saddle hey were almost at the northern air temple this is where they had the championships for sky bison polo
moving to sit at the back of the saddle with her brother do you think well really find airbenders
he is whittling a piece of wood the design is indecipherable you want me to be like you or totally honest
crossing her arms obviously angry with him are you saying im a liar
he shrugs unconcerned with her mood im saying youre an optimist same thing basically
excitedly hey guys look at this
the camera moves to show appa who is flying toward a mountain with a large structure on top it looks very similar to the southern air temple with obvious spires reminiscent of a temples architecture around them are several dark specks the camera zooms in and the specks are revealed to be people flying around the temple in planeshaped contraptions
amazed they really are airbenders
his face falls as he sees the airbenders and after kataras excited outburst he leans back and scowls while crossing his arms no theyre not
exuberantly what do you mean theyre not those guys are flying
bitterly he is glaring at the direction of the people flying around the temple gliding maybe but not flying you can tell by the way they move theyre not airbending those people have no spirit
suddenly a boy sitting in an oddly shaped chair flies right above them nearly hitting them and laughing as he does so
i dont know aangkatara points to the boy that kid seemed pretty spirited katara indicates to the boy who is flying dangerously close but still laughing
the boy begins to fly away shooting aang one more look back as he does so while grinning aang grins devilishly and opens up his glider to follow the boy he leaves katara and sokka on appa and they quickly become surrounded by gliders as they get closer to the temple several gliders almost hit appa which causes katara to knock into her brother and shout in pain as appa moves sharply to avoid them
we better find some solid ground before it finds us the siblings land appa on the temple courtyard out of the hazardous sky aang is still flying with the boy and seems to be having fun at the surprise competition
several children are on the ground cheering on their friend go teo show that bald kid how its done
teo and aang do two loopdeloops as they fly around the air temple the two boys do a spiral downwards
the boy doesnt seem upset at aang and seems happy that he isnt angry for nearly flying into him hey there youre pretty good
nonchalantly but with a smirk yeah i know but i can do more than fancy gliding
aang begins flying closer to the temple under a bridge cut to a scene of aang jumping off his glider and allowing it to fly forward on its own he begins running along a wall switching to an air scooter halfway before jumping off onto his glider again
he is looking amazed before thinking of his own plan wow i dont think i can do that but heres a good one
teo turns on a small canister that is positioned under his glider white smoke begins to stream from the strange contraption and teo flies around in the sky the camera pans to show the sight from the ground where it is revealed that he has created an image of aangs face complete with an annoyed expression the crowd below cheers
what do you think
annoyed his face mimics the one teo has just drawn its great
aang lands beside katara and sokka teo lands soon after and pulls on the brakes other children take the glider off of the top of his wheel chair teo rolls up to aang
hey youre a real airbender you must be the avatar thats amazing iive heard stories about you
rubs his head embarrassed thanks
sokka ignores all formalities instead going over to teos chair and examining the strange shape and design wow this glider chair is incredible
you think this is good wait until you see the other stuff my dad designed
all four walk inside the building they enter a room filled with pipes and machinery aang looks around worriedly beneath the pipes an original mural can be seen although it has been destroyed by the pipes which are sticking into the walls
wow runs up to machines
yeah my dad is the mastermind behind this whole place everythings powered by hot air shows women using an elevator like contraption it even pumps hot air currents outside to give us a lift while were gliding
monotonously this place is unbelievable
yeah its great isnt it
no just unbelievable walks away
katara approaches teo who seems disappointed at aangs reaction aang used to come here a long time ago i think hes a little shocked its so  different
so better
katara walks up to aang who is looking at a painted wall with pipes going through it
this is supposed to be the history of my people
katara puts her hand on his shoulder he walks over to a fountain with an air bison statue on it he looks at his reflection in the dirty green water aang looks at it squeamishly the sky bison statue suddenly has black smoke coming out of its mouth
ugh
walks up and puts her hand on his shoulder im sure some parts of the temple are still the same
screen pans off to show aang katara sokka and teo walking across a bridge to a large room that looks well kept the room has no roof although around the walls there are statues of monks mostly meditating
its nice to see that at least one part of the temple that isnt ruined
katara and aang look at a statue of a longbearded airbender meditating
offscreen look out
the statue is knocked down by a wrecking ball and all four cover their heads dust is coming from the statue so all four cough the dust clears to show six men standing where the statue used to be
what the doodle dont you know enough to stay away from construction sites we have to make room for the bathhouse he has approached aang and the group looking more surprised than upset
he turns to the mechanist and yells angrily at him do you know what you did you just destroyed something sacred for a stupid bathhouse
well people around here are starting to stink waves his hand in front of his face as though trying to dissipate a bad smell
points at the mechanist this whole place stinks using his airbending aang flips the crane contraption off of the edge of the building
cut to exterior shot showing the crane falling and landing heavily against the side of the cliff the temple is situated on it is covered by a cloud of dirt and snow as it is utterly destroyed
this is a sacred temple you cant treat it this way walks closer to the mechanist ive seen it when the monks were here i know what its supposed to be like
the monks but scratches his beard youre twelve
teo rolls up dad hes the avatar he used to come here a hundred years ago
aang takes a menacing step closer to the mechanist who takes a step back
what are you doing who said you could be here
turns away from aang hmm doing here  a long time ago points finger up but not a hundred years my people became refugees walks behind his sons wheelchair after a terrible flood my infant son teo looks down sadly teo was badly hurt and lost his mother sniffles i needed somewhere to rebuild and i stumbled across this place couldnt believe it everywhere pictures of flying people but empty looks around nobody home then does a airplane like gesture like hes flying up to aang i came across these fanlike contraptions
our gliders
yes little light flying machines waves his hands up and down they gave me an idea build a new life for my son in the air then everyone will be on equal ground so to speak were just in the process of improving upon whats already here katara wipes her tears on aangs shirt and sokka looks like hes holding back tears and after all isnt that what nature does
nature knows where to stop
i suppose thats true unfortunately progress has a way of getting away from us look at the time points at candles come to other workers the pulley system must be oiled before dark
wait how can you tell the time from that thing the notches all look the same
the candle will tell us watch candle pops four times
you put spark powder in the candle
four flashes so its exactly four hours past midday or as i call it four ocandle sokka laughs cut to a frontal shot of the mechanist pleased that sokka is interested if you like that wait till you see my fingersafe knife sharpener he holds up his left hand revealing that three of the fingers are made of wood only took me three tries to get it right he pulls off the three wooden fingers and throws them into sokkas hand
horrified aaah
pokes sokka in the back with his one remaining finger and gestures for him to come follow me sokka runs after him
hey aang i want to show you something
screen fades to black before reappearing with katara teo and aang walking inside a building
i just cant get over it theres not a single thing thats the same
i dont know about that the temple might be different picks up hermit crab from the ground but the creatures that live here hands it to katara are probably direct descendants of the ones who lived here a long time ago
pokes hermit crab youre right theyre kind of keepers of the temples origins katara hands it to aang it moves around in his hand and he smiles
besides theres one part of the temple that hasnt changed at all
screen fades slightly and reappears at a long hallway with airbending symbols through it shows all three looking at a door with an airbending contraption on it
hey its just like the one in the other temple
confidently with a matteroffact tone only an airbender can open it so inside its completely untouched just the way the monks left it ive always wondered what its like in there 
she looks at him as though slightly scared of his reaction her tone is gentle and questioning aang
he turns away from the door and his friends im sorry this is the last part of the temple thats the same as it was i want it to stay that way
somewhat disappointed although he tries not to let it show i completely understand i just wanted you to know that its here
thanks all three start to walk away
screen cuts to sokka and the mechanist walking down a dark stairway holding lanterns
these lanterns are terrible i cant see opens the top of his lantern only to find them filled with fireflies why would you want to use fireflies for light one flies out
hey close that up theyll get loose sokka closes it fireflies are a nonflammable light source both begin to walk again
they continue for a while until they arrive at a wooden door
cover your nose both plug their noses and hold your breath the mechanist opens an eye slot in the door both look inside a pitchblack room
nasally due to his nose being blocked okay  so you brought me all the way down here to see an empty room
closes eye slot wrong its filled to the brim with natural gas came across it my first time here unfortunately i was carrying a torch at the time nearly blew my self and the whole place even more sky high thought my eyebrows would never grow back pans up to his eyebrows anyway theres a vital problem that needs solving from time to time we have gas leaks and theyre nearly impossible to find
so this place is an explosion waiting to happen
yes until i figure out how to locate something i cant see hear smell or touch
cut to a exterior of temple with people flying in the sky aang katara and teo are on the ground
the wind will carry you it supports something inside you something even lighter than air shows katara holding a glider and standing at the edge of a building and that something takes over when you fly katara puts down her glider and looks up at the other people flying
nervously ive changed my mind i think i was born without that something
laughs impossible everybody has it
spirit
what
spirit thats the something youre talking about
thoughtfully yeah i suppose it is
shows katara with the glider in her hands again
are you ready
no jumps off anyway aaaaah starts to fall down wards but eventually starts to fly straight her scream peters off as she begins laughing i cant believe im flying
aang and momo fly up beside her
just make sure you keep your mouth closed so you dont swallow a bug shows momo flying by and eating a bug
teo was right about the air all i had to do was trust it let it carry me
even though teos not an airbender he really does have the spirit of one aang lands beside him on the building ive been thinking if you want to see whats in that room id be happy to open the door for you
great
wait katara flies by how do i land this thing what if i land over aackackbleck bug bug ack that was a bug
back to sokka and the mechanist the mechanist is drawing on a large piece of paper and sokka is looking through shelves sokka drops various things including seven scrolls four pieces of paper a hardboiled egg and a model of a hot air balloon
i said dont touch anything comes over to help sokka pick things up oh dont worry that experiments old referring to the hot air balloon and that egg was just part of last weeks lunch
he sniffs the air before wincing ugh week old egg smell
quick find that egg both crawl around the floor looking for it
shows aang teo and katara at the door of the airbending room
i cant believe im finally going to see whats inside
aang airbends into the doors contraption flipping three dials so air comes out of them cut to sokka and the mechanist searching for the egg
how can something so small that you cant even see it make such a big stink
the mechanist looks up from searching
thats the solution to our problem
yeah  both turn toward each other if we put a whole mess of rotten eggs in the cellar where the gas seeps up 
 the gas will mix with the smell of rotten eggs
then if theres a leak 
 you smell rotten eggs then you just follow your nose to the place where the smell is coming from 
and plug up the hole where the gas is escaping
both throw up their hands
youre a genius bell rings on one of his desks
somethings wrong stands up ive go to go runs out the door and sokka follows
shows aang teo and katara walking into the large room its filled with fire nation weapons tools and a red hot air balloon with the fire nation insignia on it
this is a nightmare
walks in with sokka behind him you dont understand
accusingly youre making weapons for the fire nation
angrily you make weapons for the fire nation
explain all this now
he is hesitant but resigned as he begins to explain it was about a year after we moved here fire nation soldiers found our settlement you were too young to remember this teo they were going to destroy everything burn it to the ground i pleaded with them i begged them to spare us they asked what i had to offer i offered  my services you must understand i did this for you
teo looks away in shame and the mechanist leaves the scene cuts to him in his workshop placing two eggs with smiley faces in his hot air balloon model along with a candle to make it float he looks rather depressed he lets go of the bottom and it starts to float as this happens the door opens with aang and teo standing in the doorway
when are they coming
soon candle pops once very soon
you cant give them more weapons
if i dont give them what they want they will destroy this place the model of the hot air balloon catches fire and crashes the mechanist puts the fire out with a cloth
how can i be proud of you when your inventions are being used for murder
i need some time to think bell rings on his desk you need to leave go
were not leaving
then hide quickly they hide behind some of his inventions the mechanist pulls a rope that opens a trapdoor and a war minister from the fire nation is lifted into the room
you know better than to keep me waiting give me what you owe us so we can be on our way the mechanist looks down well is there a problem
hurredly no right this way gestures toward the door
qin is about to go out the door but aang airbends it shut he jumps in front of the door
the deals off
the avatar 
aang dont get involved
if i dont get what i came here for the fire nation will burn this place to rubble
get out of here slaps him in the face with an air swipe continues off screen youre leaving emptyhanded
then the destruction of this temple pointing at aang will be on your head he leaves through the trap door and aang airbends it shut
the four children are now talking on the tall bridge
this is bad
very bad
aang what are we going to do how can we possibly keep them all away
ill tell you how we have something they dont points to the sky air power we control the sky thats something the fire nation cant do we can win
i want to help he appears at the door
good well need it
cuts to an aerial shot of the temple before cutting to the mechanists workshop he is standing behind a table with sokka the model hot air balloon a few plans and a candle are resting on the table aang katara and teo are on the other side surrounded by other colonists
we finally got the war balloon working thanks to sokka this boys a genius
thank you youre a genius
thank you katara and aang exchange unamused glances
see the problem with the old war balloon was you could get it airborne places the candle in the model but once it did it just kept going he pulls a string connected to the model putting it on the table you could put a hole in the top but then all the hot air would escape so the question became how do you keep a lid on hot air
ugh if only we knew teo katara and aang laugh
a lid is actually the answer if you control the hot air you control the war balloon
huh thats actually pretty smart
okay weve got four kinds of bombs he begins listing them off on his fingers smoke slime fire and

i recognize this carving i dont know why i didnt realize sooner youre the spitting image of kanna
confused wait how do you know my grangrans name
when i was about your age i was friends with kanna she was born here in the northern tribe
she never told me
your grandmother had an arranged marriage with a young waterbender he carved that necklace for her
if grangran was engaged why did she leave
i dont know thats always been a mystery to me she left without saying goodbye
later that night at zukos ship
good luck
inside zukos room
cut to a shot of prince zuko lying in bed in the foreground of his cabin the door opens and iroh sticks his head in entering the crew wanted me to wish you safe travels
bitterly good riddance to those traitors
its a lovely night for a walk why dont you join me it would clear your head no response or just stay in your room and sit in the dark whatever makes you happy
the pirates make their way onto zukos ship bringing up blasting jelly
careful with the blasting jelly
hearing the noise uncle uncle is that you walks around the ship
the fuse to the blasting jelly is lit the ship explodes
zuko runs back to see the ship destroyed zuko 
back to the north pole sokka goes to meet yue who is looking out over the bridge
hi princess yue i made you something i carved it myself

im not happy
but youre never happy come on aang
outside near the water
bending up some water master pakku said this move is all about sinking and floating sends the water to her
bending the water i got it
the water suddenly shoots upward
that was amazing
that wasnt me
master pakku has caught them he takes the water freezes it and sticks the ice crystals into the ground
i was just showing katara a few moves
you have disrespected me my teachings and my entire culture
im sorry i 
you are no longer welcome as my student
the next morning the three meet with chief arnook master pakku and arnooks family members

uhhh  katara
ill be outside if youre man enough to fight me
yue gasps katara angrily walks out
im sure she didnt mean that
yeah i think she did
back at the fire navy base zhao meets with iroh over tea
im devastated to hear about prince zuko just  devastated
the fire lord will not be pleased when he learns who was responsible
you know who was behind the attack
yes  pirates we had a runin with them a while back they wanted revenge
sips his tea so have you reconsidered my offer
yes i accept it will be an honor to serve as your general to the fire nation
to victory
back to the northern tribe the three head outside looking for pakku
are you crazy katara youre not going to win this fight
takes off her coat i know i dont care
you dont have to do this for me i can find another teacher
im not doing it for you someone needs to slap some sense into that guy pakku comes down so you decided to show up pakku walks away arent you going to fight
go back to the healing huts with the other women where you belong katara tightens her fist and sends water whips at him pakku halts fine you want to learn to fight so bad study closely he bends two streams of water from nearby pools and sends them both at a charging katara who falls back he joins the two streams together encircling both katara and himself in a forceful ring of water dont worry im not going to hurt you
katara edges away from the ring and redirects the water away the resulting blast hits sokka pakku builds an ice wall in defense which katara slides up she lands onto a nearby post he melts the ice and directs the full blast at her however katara freezes her feet down and is able to direct the blast away
determined you cant knock me down
some of the crowd cheers
go katara
katara charges at him pakku draws up a wall of ice which she quickly liquefies she attempts to land blows but pakku ducks them all he whips water and throws her into a pool earning the approval of other members of the crowd
katara emerges from pool shakes out her hair and summons a small pillar of ice where she proceeds to send a series of ice discs at her opponent pakku breaks up most of them using his wrists the camera closes up to a slowmotion shot of one coming very close to hitting him he looks at her in irritation katara now back on the ground attacks by sending a stream of water at him however pakku generates it into a larger stream of water and sends it full force at her katara is sent back several feet a closeup shot of her shows her bent over breathing hard she rises suddenly and sends two snow pillars down at him which pakku turns to a dusty mist of snow the mist clears
well im impressed you are an excellent waterbender
but you still wont teach me will you
no
katara bends over sharply sending a wave of ice at pakku who merely raises himself onto an ice pillar he proceeds to liquefy the pillar charging straight at katara who sends a powerful stream of water his way pakku avoids the attack instead managing to freeze kataras stream of water which he slides across he surges past her and strikes her down knocking her necklace off in the process katara falls roughly to the ground as pakku lands onto the rim of a pool bends a tower of water and manipulates the stream overhead his opponent he deftly freezes the water into several ice shards which he sends down at katara she becomes trapped in the flurry of frozen daggers and appears still for a moment the crowd gasps in horror one child looks away in fear katara lifts her head and begins to struggle attempting to break free as pakku casually strolls away
this fight is over
come back here im not finished yet
yes you are notices the necklace this is my necklace 
no its not its mine give it back
i made this sixty years ago for the love of my life  for kanna
unfreezing the ice surprised my grangran was supposed to marry you
back at the fire navy base the ships are set to begin the trek north on board iroh meets up with zuko who is disguised as a shipman
our plan is working perfectly zhao doesnt suspect a thing
you didnt have to do this
no nephew of mine is going to stow away on a ship without some backup
thank you uncle
a door opens
someones coming stay hidden until we get to the north pole and the avatar will be yours good luck the two head their separate ways
the scene changes back to the north pole
i carved this necklace for your grandmother when we got engaged i thought we would have a long happy life together i loved her
but she didnt love you did she it was an arranged marriage grangran wouldnt let your tribes stupid customs run her life thats why she left it must have taken a lot of courage
yue cries and runs away

sokka exits later that night he catches up with her on the bridge

the next morning at pakkus class aang turns a blob of water into a stream and awkwardly sends it off
not bad not bad laughs keep practicing and maybe youll get it by the time youre my age
aang turns around annoyed but quickly smiles when he notices katara coming up
hey katara

the episode opens to under the water the camera pans upward to sea level and higher up into the city the scene changes to where katara is set to spar with a young boy named sangok she eyes her opponent with a look of determination sangok looks at her with a frightened expression on his face shaking slightly he summons a globule of water freezes it into an iceball and fires it at her katara however is quick to melt the iceball and turning around swiftly bends a wave of water at him which she proceeds to freeze thus suspending sangok in an icy trap
displeased nice try pupil sangok shows sangok trying to break free a couple of more years and you might be ready to fight a sea sponge he unfreezes the ice sangok falls to the ground dazed would anyone care for a rematch with katara the scene cuts to several students sitting by the sidelines the camera panning to the right showing all of them to be tired and unamused katara youve advanced more quickly than any student ive ever trained cuts to a shot of katara who smiles brightly you have proven that with fierce determination passion and hard work you can accomplish anything turns to aang irritably raw talent alone is not enough cut to aang who is lying on the ground with a lazy smile floating momo around on an airball above him pupil aang
stops bending at the sound of his name momo lands on his head yes master pakku
sarcastically care to step into the sparring circle i figure since youve found time to play with house pets you must have already mastered waterbending
jumps off the ground with airbending i wouldnt say mastered but check this out
he twists around bending some snow around him to make a snowman of himself which momo knocks over cut to pakku and katara who wear similar expressions of disdain pakku shakes his head in disappointment while katara looks on in irritation the scene changes to another part of the city where sokka and yue are taking a walk along a bridge sokka is walking along the top of bridges wall while balancing

camera view depicts entire room avatar aang we were all amazed at the stories of how you singlehandedly wiped out an entire fire navy fleet at the north pole closes up to fong stroking his beard i cant imagine what it feels like to wield such devastating power its an awesome responsibility
casually i try not to think about it too much
calmly avatar youre ready to face the fire lord now
shocked what no im not
holds out her hand in reasoning aang still needs to master all four elements
why with the kind of power he possesses power enough to destroy hundreds of battle ships in a matter of minutes he could defeat the fire lord now
but sir the thing is aang can only do those things when hes in the avatar state
see its this special state where
sharply im well aware your eyes and tattoos glow and youre able to summon unbelievable power without you wed be slaughtered before we even reach their shores looks at map and guides finger from the location of the base to the location of the fire nation capital but with you leading the way as the ultimate weapon we could cut a swath right through to the heart of the fire nation
doubtfully right but i dont know how to get in or out of the avatar state much less what to do once im there
so its decided then ill help you figure out how to get into the avatar state and then youll face your destiny
the group rises angrily no nothings decided we already have a plan aangs pursuing his destiny his way
well while you take your time learning the elements the war goes on may i show you something leads aang to a window thats the infirmary and those soldiers are the lucky ones several soldiers are injured and walking slowly they came back every day the fire nation takes lives people are dying aang you could end it now think about it

the tanks fire rotating grappling hooks from canisters into the tunnel and release them after a few moments unleashing a myriad of boulders the scene switches to where the group has begun navigating their way through the tunnels only to turn and witness the entrance being closed off appa begins to frantically paw the walls of the tunnel
its okay appa well be fine i hope
we will be fine all we need is a plan chong how long do those torches last

grabbing torches and stomping out the fire it doesnt work like that if theyre all lit at the same time

katara gestures with the torch toward at the panels along the tomb speaking about each one in turn aang and katara exchanged glances and katara narrates the story the first image is that of a mountain
voiceover they met on top of the mountain that divided their two villages 
two figures a man dressed in red and a woman in blue meet atop the mountain they take each others hands though they swiftly let go and a chinese character appears
voiceover the villages were enemies so they could not be together  character flashes red as the background turns grim and dark but their love was strong and they found a way
two hills appear on the closer one is the man while the woman kneels on the one farther away though their faces cannot be seen in detail it is obvious that they long for the other

angrily spreads arms out dramatically yes were all thinking of ideas
well then listen to this if love is the key out of here then all we need to do is play a love song begins playing song much to sokkas dismay

how are we going to find our way out of these tunnels

shyly blushing well what if we  kissed

pats his stomach in a contented manner much practice
zuko turns to leave
junior where are your manners you need to thank these nice people

bitterly i know
he leaves but stops as he comes across an ostrich horse quietly he walks over to the animal unfastens it from its post and leads it away the camera cuts to a shot from songs front yard zuko appears on screen riding the animal
what are you doing these people just showed you great kindness

hey you saved us sokka
no they were trying to get away from something
from what
the caves rumble cuts to an overhead shot of the group as a wall of rock crumbles without warning two giant badgermoles burst through the caves causing the group to panic one badgermole closes its hands together in a prayerful manner closing off a tunnel behind it with earthbending the camera shifts right across the group and cuts to the other badgermole which pounds the ground with its paws and raises a wall of earth blocking off the exits cuts to an overhead shot of the cave where one badgermole is seen using earthbending to create a split in the earth between the nomads and sokka
cuts to sokka who tries to avoid the badgermoles swipes he is blown back several feet and starts hastily backing away his fingers hitting a string on the lute in the process producing a musical note cuts to a closeup of a badgermole who cocks its head curiously the creatures quiet down as he picks up the lute and begins playing a tune

the scene switches to aang and katara who are standing underneath the ceiling of glowing crystals their hands linked
theyre made of some kind of crystal they must only light up in the dark
thats how the two lovers found each other gestures with her hand along the ceiling they just put out their lights and followed the crystals sees the exit that must be the way out the two hug
so uh 
lets go
she runs toward the exit aang stares after her before shaking his head and smiling he and appa follow close behind they make their way out of the cave and into the outdoors appa bounds out of the tunnel and flops onto his back tongue lolling out in content
what about sokka
the two seem a bit concerned at first but a rumbling is heard cuts to an overhead shot of the exit where at that moment sokka and the band of nomads emerge from the cave riding atop badgermoles debris flies everywhere and aang and katara shield themselves from the rubble the camera pans upward to sokka riding atop one of the creatures waving momo flying about

cuts to overhead shot of the cave the camera panning to the left sokka dismounts the badgermole and approaches katara
how did you guys get out

he turns to the badgermoles and waves to them as they slowly plod their way into the cave again two walls of rock rise up where the badgermoles reentered the cave the camera pans to where momo is seemingly communicating with appa telling him of his journey through the caves appa seemingly roars in response to the lemur katara is seen hugging her brother
why is your forehead all red

sokka smacks his forehead enlarging the red spot while chong looks at him in curiosity meanwhile aang confronts the other nomads

the group proceeds through the tunnel to the inside of omashu aang conjures an air ball with his staff to clear the path while katara uses waterbending to maneuver the sewage carefully around her sokka on the other hand is continually soaked in the foul substance
that wasnt as bad as i thought
sokka emerges covered in slime katara spots water nearby and splashes sokka with it using waterbending to wash off the sewage followed by aang who uses airbending to dry him off while he screams which reveals that three pentapi have attached themselves to his skin
in a panicking tone while trying to yank the pentapox off ahh they wont let go help
quickly tackles sokka into a wall in order to slience him in a somewhat cheerful tone shh stop making so much noise its just a purple pentapus
sokka looks at the pentapuses in fear aang removes the first pentapus by lightly rubbing its head as sokka watches sokka rubs the spot where the creature was attached and does the same procedure to get the second one off several guards suddenly approach them as aang takes the third one off
hey what are you kids doing out past curfew

calmly listen to me aang there are options in fighting called jing its a choice of how you direct your energy
cut to a closeup of an annoyed aang counting along on his fingers as he sums up the different jings i know theres positive jing when youre attacking and negative jing when youre retreating
happily smiling  and neutral jing when you do nothing
he looks shocked at his three raised fingers there are three jings
well technically there are eightyfive but lets just focus on the third neutral jing is the key to earthbending it involves listening and waiting for the right moment to strike
starting to understand thats why you surrendered isnt it
yes and its why i cant leave now
aang sadly turns around
disappointed i guess i need to find someone else to teach me earthbending
your teacher will be someone who has mastered neutral jing you need to find someone who waits and listens before striking
momo lands on aangs shoulders
happily hey momo
momos mastered a few jings himself
momo screeches loudly at bumi

shrugging no offense to the swamp but i dont see any land there to land on
i dont know bumi said to learn earthbending i would have to wait and listen and now im actually hearing the earth do you want me to ignore it
sokka katara and momo look over appas saddle down at the swamp
yes
i dont know theres something ominous about that place
momo hides inside appas saddle as appa groans
see even appa and momo dont like it here
resignedly okay since everyone feels so strongly about this looks at swamp bye swamp shakes appas rope yip yip
appa groans and flies upward away from the swamp a tornado suddenly emerges from out of nowhere heading right for appa sokka hearing something turns around and finally sees it
panicked you better throw in an extra yip we gotta move
appa starts to fly faster attempting to avoid the tornado however he is not fast enough to get away as the tornado begins to move closer to appa the wind pulls sokka right off from the saddle katara manages to grab his hand holding him back from flying into the tornado aang jumps up onto appas saddle and creates an air shield around appa stabilizing the air and allowing sokka to fall back into the saddle uninjured the wind sucks appa who is still protected by the air shield into the tornado aang struggles to maintain the air shield however as it shrinks one of appas legs slips from the protective air thereby breaking it aang katara and sokka fall off appa with aang landing lightly in muddied water as the latter two land quite roughly appa and momo are thrown elsewhere in the swamp
looking around the swamp and at his friends wheres appa and momo aang jumps up to the top of the trees looking for his animal friends as he uses the height to search for them appa momo
the scene cuts back to katara and sokka katara glances at her elbow before looking up at her brother
pointing blandly sokka youve got an elbow leech
he spins around panicking trying to find it where where
a creature is shown sticking on to sokkas elbow
crosses her arms sarcastically where do you think
ripping off the elbow leech and throwing it behind to katara he cries out angrily why do things keep attaching to me
aang swings over the muddied water on a vine waiting for it to stop moving so he can land
you couldnt find them
jumping down into the muddy water no and the tornado  it just disappeared
katara and sokka turn to face the darkness in the swamp the scene switches to appa who is hanging suspended over the swamp caught in a mass of vines momo jumps up from the saddle and begins chewing through the vines appa falls with momo into the muddy water he shakes the water from his fur and takes off flying before again becoming trapped appa groans as momo berates him before the lemur begins to cut the vines again the scene switches back to aang katara and sokka
cutting the vines with his machete we better speed things up
to sokka maybe we should be a little nicer to the swamp
continuing to cut the vines aang these are just plants do you want me to say please and thank you as i swing my machete back and forth
maybe you should listen to aang something about this place feels  alive
im sure there are lots of things that are alive here and if we dont wanna wind up getting eaten by them we need to find appa as fast as we can
sokka continues to slice through the vines the shot changes perspective to show aang katara and sokka through the vines as though someone is looking at them the scene changes to appa and momo appa is walking on the wet muddy ground trailing his footprints behind carrying momo on his back a tree trunk happens to be in appas way and the bison collapses to the ground unwilling to attempt flying over it or crawling beneath it momo takes aangs bison whistle and blows it to make appa move the bison ignores it the first time growling angrily but when momo blows it a second time he uses his tail to squash the lemur dazed from the blow momo sways and collapses the scene changes back to aang katara and sokka now walking through a foggier part of the swamp
yelling appa momo
theres no way they can hear us and no way we can see them well have to make camp for the night
several flies surround sokka sokka swings his machete at them trying to shoo them away at that moment a huge bubble of swamp gas rises from the muddy water below them the gas grows closer to aang katara and sokka
what was that
nothing just swamp gas indicating look theres nothing supernatural going on here
the three groan as the smell reaches them with sokka waving his hand in front of his nose as katara clamps hers shut suddenly the quiet is shattered by a terrifying scream causing them all to scream and huddle together looking around wideeyed for the source the camera zooms backward showing a small grumpylooking white bird it opens its beak extremely wide emitting the terrifying scream and flutters off
sweating his voice cracking i think we should build a fire
sokka runs off to a nearby tree and cuts pieces of wood from its roots aang and katara walk up to sokka
sokka the longer were here the more i think you shouldnt be doing do that
no i asked the swamp it said this was fine grabs a nearby root right swamp shakes the root and fakes a reply no problem sokka
sokka continues to chop up the roots while aang looks somewhat annoyed the scene changes to a later shot of the trio around a fire katara glancing around at the swamp
does anyone else get the feeling that were being watched
sokka is shown with a fly buzzing around him he does not seems scared anymore
please were all alone out here
sokka uses his machete to try and scare the fly off the fly turns into a big shining ball of light it flies away from the gang illuminating over a dozen pairs of eyes staring at them they turn around and see them
except for them
they turn back around and huddle together
his calm demeanor vanishing right except for them
the scene changes to appa and momo who are lying down on a giant tree branch the constant nocturnal noises echoing around them has momo scuttling frantically from one end of the saddle to the other whilst chittering in fear appa unable to sleep by the noise growls loudly causing the noises to stop and momo settles down on appas saddle as momo begins to close his eyes another small sound is heard causing his ears to perk up and his eyes to widen the scene changes back to aang katara and sokka the camp fire is beginning to die out and the three friends are huddled together sleeping another perspective shot shows someone looking at them through the vines a vine snakes its way to sokkas leg which is sticking out and begins to wind around both it and sokkas whole body
the shot cuts to an overhead view of the three each tied up by several vines that snake out of the frame the scene cuts to a closeup profile shot of the three for a moment they are still asleep  sokka holding his machete and drooling  but they awake screaming as the vines simultaneously yank them all out off the screen and away from each other
the scene cuts to sokka he plants the blade of his machete in the ground as he is dragged away both katara and aang are also dragged off into the mist sokka gets up and looks around for his sister and aang the respite does not last long as vines are suddenly thrown at him they wrap around him and attempt to drag him away again before he can travel too far sokka starts hacking the vines with his machete he frees himself and runs back down the tree root pursued by more vines
the scene cuts to katara struggling to free herself from the vines using a water whip she cuts through her bonds and runs off into the mist
the scene cuts to aang who frees himself by creating an air bubble around him and expanding it his bonds attach to the bubble and aang jumps away before they ensnare him again he jumps through the trees closely pursued by more vines he escapes a vine that pulls him to the ground using his airbending to propel himself far away and soon finds himself alone in the swamp cut to a wide shot of aang looking around for his friends
guys
the scene fades to a shot of appas footprint which is now filled with swamp water two figures are looking down at the footprint due is tall and skinny while his friend tho is short and fat both wear small animal skin loincloths and have a single large leaf on their heads to serve as a hat tho is carrying a stick and uses it to indicate the animal track
whatd you reckon make a track like that tho
dont know due points his stick at the footprint somein with six legs pretty biguns too
the camera pans up to reveal more of appas tracks in the mud
leaves a nice wide trail to folla
you know whats at the end of that trail
due shakes his head in the negative cut to a closeup of thos smiling face
grinning dinner
the scene cuts to appa swimming in the marshy water before cutting to a closeup of momo a fly is buzzing around his head and he watches it shifting his eyes from side to side it flies off and momo goes after it he lands on a nearby tree root still attempting to catch the fly he hops from tree root to tree root following the fly although unknowingly lands on the back of a catgator he catches the fly on the last root but lets go of it as he jumps to fly away from the creature it pursues momo as he flies back to appa the camera pans left following the chase when momo and the crocodile reach appa the sky bisons mouth is open and the catgator swims right into it appa holds the creature there for a moment before spitting it back out momo and the catfish crocodile hiss at each other for a moment and the crocodile swims off the scene cuts back to appa who shakes his head and loudly groans
cut to katara who is walking through an area where the tree roots are covered in white flowers
calling out aang sokka
ahead of katara is another water tribe woman her back facing katara she wears the same robe as katara and has the same hair style katara begins walking toward the figure
hello hello can you help me she squints mom more loudly and running toward the figure mom
katara runs to the figure her eyes streaming tears of joy she reaches the figure and places a hand on her shoulder
i cant believe 
the smile leaves her face as the scene begins to lighten katara stands in front of a tree stump as she realizes the figure was only an illusion katara gasps falling to her knees as she begins to cry it cuts to an overhead shot of the very devastated katara and fades to shot of sokkas hand holding his machete in the air the rest of sokka appears
aang while slashing at the vines stupid swamp dumb ugly vines katara he becomes caught and grunts with exertion before slicing himself free you think youre so tough huh
sokka trips over as he cuts through the vine in which he was tangled falling offscreen with his face in the mud upon lifting up his head he sees an image of yue in a beam of light not far in front of him sokka stands up puts away his machete and starts walking toward yue
hello yue he takes a hold of his head before removing his hands and shrugging turning away from the apparition this is just a trick of the light  swamp gas  i  hit my head running away last night im going crazy almost fearfully he turns around and walks closer
accusingly you didnt protect me
sokka rubs his eyes in disbelief opening them to find that yue has disappeared sokka sighs in relief but as he turns around he falls over backward startled at seeing yue right before his eyes again the image of yue disappears immediately after that and sokka stands up and pulls his machete back out almost threateningly
the scene switches to aang who is wandering the swamp calling the names of his friends
katara appa
upon wading through the swamp aang notices an unfamiliar girl in a dress standing on a hill accompanied by a winged pig
hello who are you
the pig flies off and the girl giggles before turning around and running away
hey come back he holds his hand out as though to grab her
aang jumps to the top of the hill only to find she has completely disappeared from his sight hearing her laugh again aang turns around only to see her running across the limbs of another tree he uses the vines however before he can even reach his destination the girl has moved and is now running across the ground tries to chase the girl aang continues his wild chase through the treetops as the scene switches to show appa with momo on his back swimming through the river that flows through the swamp a little further on the stream covered by fog is a group of six swamp tribe members divided over three canoes due and tho sitting in the middle canoe they look at each other in silence for a few moments tho wetting his lips using his tongue appa halts as momo chitters at the strange people
look at that tho is that a little hairy fella ridin that thing
no thats what they call a lemoo saw one at a traveling show once real smart they say
bet he tastes a lot like possum chicken
you think everything tastes like possum chicken
cmon now fellas he moves to the front of the boat just a little closer nice and easy nothing to worry about we just fixin to eat ya
appa turns around and takes off in the opposite direction
annoyed whatd you say that fer
shrugging as he tries to appease his friend well we are
but you dont have to tell em that
he shrugs again well howd i know theyd understand me
come on
due stands up in front of the canoe and starts spinning his arms bending the water behind his canoe in order to chase appa the other two canoes follow suit trailing behind appa in a v formation appa bounds through the river desperate to escape the strange people hunting him the scene switches back to aang who is still chasing the girl
who are you
peering through a wall of vegetation aang sees the girl on a small hill running after her it is too late to stop as he notices that it is not the girl but katara aang runs into the waterbender and they both fall over sokka hears the commotion and turns around to investigate with his machete cocked  in the wrong direction as only a few seconds later aang and katara come barreling down the root he is standing on and hit him in the back knocking him over too
he stands up and puts his machete away what do you guys think youre doing ive been looking all over for you
she has not moved although her hand is on her head as she sits on the root they have fallen onto well ive been wandering around looking for you
he looks away before airbending himself to his feet he appears embarrassed that he was not actively searching for his friends like they were him i was chasing some girl
what girl
he walks over to katara and helps her up before rubbing his ear i dont know i heard laughing and i saw some girl in a fancy dress
sarcastically with exaggerated hand movements well there must be a tea party here and we just didnt get our invitations
i thought i saw mom
look we were all just scared and hungry and our minds were playing tricks on us thats why we all saw things out here
surprised you saw something too
he looks away for a moment before turning back and taking a step closer to his sister i thought i saw yue but that doesnt prove anything look i think about her all the time and you saw mom someone you miss a lot
what about me i didnt know the girl i saw and all our visions led us right here
aang begins walking around as if looking for something
okay  so wheres here the middle of the swamp
aang looks around his gaze finally resting on a massive tree growing right next to him the camera pans to reveal exactly how enormous the tree really is
yeah the center  its the heart of the swamp its been calling us here i knew it
its just a tree he raises his arms above his head it cant call anyone for the last time theres nothing after us and theres nothing magical happening here
as sokka finishes his tirade a seaweed monster jumps out from the water the gang huddles together and screams separating as the monster begins to attack them the seaweed monster goes after sokka first as the trio split up each running in different directions sokka is picked up and swung around only being released as aang uses airbending to slice part of the monsters arm off the monster goes after aang flicking the monk away and into the surrounding trees sokka is shown fighting with the vines that had him captured only seconds ago and so intent was he at destroying them he failed to notice a column rising behind himself the column attaches to the seaweed monster and sokka is swiped from the ground katara comes to his rescue this time as she slices at the monsters arm it did not have the desired effect as more vines grew to patch up the hole her waterbending created she manages to push the monster back a little however it is not long before she is flung away aang stops to watch her giving the monster time to attack him sokka is absorbed into the chest of the monster as the scene changes to appa continuing his escape from the foggy swamp members momo throws objects at them from the back of his friend attempting to slow them down one of these such items was a shirt that appears to belong to sokka at a foggy swamp member resulting in the boat that member was on to spin out of control
now what would a lemoo need a shirt fer
tho manages to capture momo after the latter hits a low tree branch and is thrown backward the loss of his friend encourages appa to run faster the scene changes back to the gang fighting the seaweed monster after using a tornadolike airbending move katara freezes sokka in place before shooting him with water expelling him from the monsters body the fight ends as katara begins to waterbend repeatedly at the monster slicing through the vines and not allowing the monster to regenerate a person is seen inside the monster bending the vines
theres someone in there hes bending the vines
with a final slice katara cuts through the mask on the seaweed monster the whole top half falling off however this does not stop the monster and vines spring out of the marsh capturing katara high on a pillar aang airbends over to the monster and using his native bending rips apart the vines
demanding offensively why did you call me here if you just wanted to kill us
wait the vines drop to reveal a slightly larger man wearing nothing but a leaf loincloth i didnt call you here
he shares a look of confusion with sokka who is also in an offensive stance we were flying over and i heard something calling to me telling me to land
hes the avatar stuff like that happens to us a lot
the avatar come with me
the trio drop their stances and look at each other the scene cuts to huu leading the gang to the top of the giant tree aang noticed earlier
so who are you then
bending a vine out of the way i protect the swamp from folks that want to hurt it like this fella with his big knife
see completely reasonable he finally puts his machete away not a monster just a regular guy defending his home nothing mystical about it
oh the swamp is a mystical place all right its sacred i reached enlightenment right here under the banyangrove tree he sits on the tree looking at the group as he explains i heard it calling me just like you did
humoring huu sure you did it seems real chatty
the camera zooms out as he explains slowly revealing more and more of the swamp it shows how large the banyangrove tree is compared to the others but at the final magnification it is impossible to distinguish it from the other trees see this whole swamp is actually just one tree spread out over miles branches spread and sink take root and spread some more one big living organism just like the entire world
cuts back to aang looking at huu he is still openly skeptical i get how the tree is one big thing but the whole world
sure you think youre any different from me or your friends or this tree if you listen hard enough you can hear every living thing breathing together another shot shows the swamp river there are the sounds of several animals heard in the background you can feel everything growing were all living together even if most folks dont act like it we all have the same roots and we are all branches of the same tree
she and her friends are now sitting listening to huu but what did our visions mean
in the swamp we see visions of people weve lost people we loved folks we think are gone the shot cuts to show the people that sokka and katara saw in the swamp before cutting back to huu but the swamp tells us theyre not were still connected to them time is an illusion and so is death
but what about my vision it was someone i had never met
youre the avatar you tell me
he looks down as he tries to understand time is an illusion so its someone i will meet
huu nods
sorry to interrupt the lesson but we still need to find appa and momo
i think i know how to find them aang kneels down and places his hand on the tree everything is connected energy travels from aangs hand to appas location appa is seen being captured by the foggy swamp members back at the banyangrove tree aang stands up come on weve got to hurry
back to the foggy swamp members appa is trapped inside a net while tho sings
singing and tapping the side of his canoe momo is seen struggling inside the sack he has been placed in set my lines by the river bed caught ten fish and i killed em dead cut em and gut em and i tossed the heads in the water to keep them catgators fed
the boats stop when a jet of water appears and destroys the boat next to tho and dues the two people from the destroyed boat fly into the water as aang appears on a tree branch
appa
aang airbends a stream of air throwing tho into the water and freeing momo who was being held by tho
were under attack
due scoops up a puddle of water and sends it toward aang and katara the three become engaged in a waterbending fight with neither side gaining an advantage
hey you guys are waterbenders
you too that means were kin due ceases waterbending followed by a slightly disgusted katara he watches as sokka and huu run up to the branch katara and aang are standing on hey huu how you been
you know scared some folks swung some vines the usual
huu
the scene cuts to the gang sitting around a fire in the foggy swamp tribe there is a member waterbending some liquid in a pot to stirs it and due grabs a fish from the pot before moving over to the fire
how you like that possum chicken
tastes just like arctic hen so why were you guys so interested in eating appa he indicates the catgator lying behind tho youve got plenty of those big things wandering around
you want me to eat old slim hes like a member of the family
due pulls the fish off the branch and gives it to slim
nice slim
sokka throws a bug at the catgator it bounces off his nose and he growls at sokka who cowers slightly
laughing oh he dont eat no bugs thats people food
whered you say you was from
smiling sokka is shown chewing nonchalantly next to her the south pole
didnt know there was waterbenders anywhere but here they got a nice swamp there do they
no its all ice and snow
hmm no wonder you left
to katara well i hope you realize now that nothing strange was going on here he raises his arms for emphasis just a bunch of greasy people living in a swamp
what about the visions
i told you we were hungry im eating a giant bug
sokka holds up said giant bug taking a bit of its abdomen he swallows it with some difficulty before exhaling sharply sticking his tongue out
feeding momo but what about when the tree showed me where appa and momo were
thats avatar stuff that doesnt count to huu the only thing i cant figure out is how you made that tornado that sucked us down
i cant do anything like that i just bend the water in the plants
well no accounting for weather still theres absolutely nothing mysterious about the swamp
cut to a long shot of the camp from across the river the white screaming bird from earlier lands on a visible tree branch and lets out its horrible cry a nearby vine rises up and bats the bird into the camera which goes dark
when the image returns it is of a full moon back in the earth kingdom village where zuko and iroh were seen last the camera pans down to reveal the broadsword man walking down a street alone he hears something behind him turns and draws his blades the scene cuts to a frontal shot of him where there was nothing behind him
whos there
the scene cuts to a closeup shot of his hands which are both grabbed by another person he is disarmed and thrown against some nearby boxes his swords falling uselessly to the ground his assailants feet are seen to approach the sword he picks them up the camera in turn reveals that the assailant is the blue spirit himself
fades to credits
the episode begins by showing a coast before panning down to in the middle of a forest where the gang is asleep except for momo switch to a view from inside sokkas open mouth looking out a spider has set up its web over his mouth momo discovers the spider and inspects it with great interest when a flies lands on the web momo tries to grab it as he plunges his hand completely in sokkas mouth sokka opens his eyes immediately in surprise he shoots up and starts to spit out the remains of the spider and its web
angrily what are you doing in my mouth momo chitters happily while lying upside down on sokkas belly chewing on the fly he rescued from the spiders web momo you need to be a little more sensitive to my boundaries
the lemur seems to notice something else on his left he completely ignores sokkas comment and climbs on his face where he erects himself and pricks up his ears to determine what it is he heard he chitters loudly waking up katara who was sleeping on a nearby sawed off tree trunk
switch to aang who is still sleeping soundly on appas forearm he wakes up as the ground begins to shake kahchi sitting atop a rhino jumps out of the thicket katara gasps as two more emerge from the bushes on the other side of the camp
shouting from up above as he looks over the campsite give up youre completely surrounded
an overview shot of the campsite shows that four rhinos are circling around the gang
closeup of vachir as he fires two flaming arrows toward sokka who was trying to crawl away like a caterpillar in his sleeping bag the arrows pin the back of the sleeping bag to the ground while sokka crawls out he moves out of the path of a third arrow just in time
crawling toward appa come on come on come on
sokka climbs aboard appa where aangs already waiting for him switch to a closer shot of katara as she also makes her way toward appa just before she reaches him she stops in her tracks and turns around
kahchi spins his guan dao around and plants it in the sawed of tree trunk katara was sleeping on a bit earlier next to the tree trunk lie some of team avatars supplies

shocked my staff
he jumps off appas head while sokka just manages to get on
switch to the guan dao blade into the stump right next to a wooden box the camera pans to the right to reveal katara charging kahchi with a water whip she freezes the blade solid to the trunk giving her the opportunity to grab the box of scrolls she heads back toward appa just as kahchi manages to break his weapon free of the ice
cut to ogodei who is swinging his chains around he throws them around a tree and pulls it down to impede aangs progress toward his staff it has no effect as aang just somersaults over the fallen tree
closeup of yehlu as he ignites one of the hand grenades hanging on his belt he throws it at aang who has reached his staff by now the explosive lands right beside him but the fuse is still burning aang swirls his staff around and knocks the explosive out of the way and into the woods aang propels himself into the air with airbending while the bomb explodes he lands on appas head
yip yip
appa rises from the ground leaving the rough rhinos behind mongke shoots a fire ball at them as they fly over katara and sokka quickly duck and cover their heads as the fire ball just misses them as sokka erects again he notices something on the ground
stretching out his arm over the saddle as if he wants to grab it wait my boomerang
the camera zooms out on sokkas boomerang which still lies in the middle of their besieged camp
grabbing sokkas arm theres no time
annoyed oh i see turning to katara so theres time to get your scrolls turning toward aang and time to get your staff looking back at katara with his hand on his chest but no time for my boomerang
cheerfully thats correct
bowing his head in defeat by this totally honest answer oh
cut to a shot of mongke who angrily turns his head as appa disappears at the horizon
screen changes to a small village at the edge of a cliff surrounded by open green fields appa landed nearby a small wooden house
to a sulking sokka sorry about your boomerang sokka
camera moves back to show how sokka sits on the ground in a gloomy mood katara is buying supplies is the background
sadly i feel like ive lost part of my identity he jumps up and moves aangs hat slightly so that he can point at aangs arrow imagine if you lost your arrow or katara lost her  makes a hair loopies gesture with a somewhat bored look hair loopies
he slowly saunters over to the stall where katara gives him a loving hug in order to comfort him before she holding her hands in front of herself while smiling lovely at sokka
heres your produce ponytail guy
he picks up the basket full of supplies looking dejected at the nickname i used to be boomerang guy 
aang and katara follow sokka with looks of sympathy as he walks away the merchant heads toward katara who gives him some money
surprised after inspecting the money hey water tribe money
i hope thats okay
clutching the coin so long as its money the merchant closes his shop while katara walks over to aang who is trying to console a crying sokka as the camera pans up to show just the merchants head have a nice avatar day
interested avatar day
turning around while waving you guys are going to the festival right
they all look at each other for a moment trying to figure out what to do aang and katara smile at each other while tears still run over sokkas face
the camera pans down to reveal an overview shot of chin village switch to a shot of several festive green lanterns hanging over the street the shot tilts down aang katara and sokka are standing in the middle of the busy street looking around in interest
theres a holiday for the avatar who knew
they turn around as a large effigy of avatar kyoshi rolls by
pointing at the float look they made a giant kyoshi float
they run to the side switch to a closeup of kyoshis head aang sokka and katara emerge from a side street
and here comes avatar roku roku effigy rolls by
overview shot of the main square that is packed with people the giant float of kyoshi and roku are being pulled to the middle
having a huge festival in your honor is great but frankly its just nice to be appreciated
and its nice to appreciate their deepfried festival food he takes a huge bite out of the fooditem he is holding
pointing at a giant float of aang coming down the street aang look
thats the biggest me ive ever seen
closeup as aangs float pulls up besides that of the other two avatars on the main square the camera pans to the right of the floats as a villager carrying a torch comes running down the street
now a torch thats a nice prop its bright dangerous  sniffs smells manly but im not sure i could carry it off
sokka takes another bite of his food as katara points at the runner
surprised hey whats that guy doing
with a loud scream the runner jumps through the effigy of kyoshi causing it to catch fire the fire spreads rapidly over the whole effigy
chanting as kyoshis effigy is consumed by the flames down with the avatar
the villagers continue chanting while the runner sets fire to the roku effigy next the camera zooms in on aang katara and sokka who are utterly shocked by the turn of events sokkas mouth falls open and food drips out
cut to a shot of another town atop a hill as two people are walking down the quiet street a shadowy figure quickly passes them by on the roof the blue spirit lands in front of the two people and unsheathes his dual dao swords as he jumps at the man carrying two baskets suspended on a long pole he swiftly cuts the baskets off in one fluid motion the terrified man cowers back as the blue spirit moves in to collect his prize he hangs the baskets over his shoulders and heads for the woman who is carrying a large piece of fruit on her head the blue spirit snatches the fruit off her head and disappears as swiftly as he had come the man and woman are left in confusion as to what just happened
switch to a scene in the forest the camera follows the descent of a fly that is snatched out of the air by a chameleon resting on a branch the blue spirit is making his way through the thicket the mask of the blue spirit is placed in a hollow part at the base of a tree zuko peeks around the trunk the camera zooms toward a cavern where iroh is sitting he looks up when zuko drops the barrels of food at his feet
wondering where did you get these
angrily while walking away what does it matter where they came from
seriously mmmm  takes a bite out of one of the cupcakes zuko brought the jam drips of his chin in delight  mmmm
switch back to the burning effigies of the avatars in chin village as the chants continue the mayor signals to the torchbearer who is now on the roof to throw his torch the torchbearer grins as he takes aim and throws his torch with a grunt right into the right eye of aangs float the crowd cheers in approval while aang looks at his own effigy burn with a look of pain on his face closing his own right eye katara runs to the front and uses her waterbending to extinguish the flames with water from two large pots nearby
angrily pointing an accusing finger at katara that party poopers ruining avatar day
aang looks angrily at the villager he airbends himself to the top of his own float and lands on the left shoulder of his still smoking effigy
angered that party poopers my friend he takes off his hat and throws it away to reveal his arrow
pointing in shock at aang its the avatar himself
scared its going to kill us with its awesome avatar powers
no im not i 
aang raises his hand several villagers run for cover in fear the villager that spoke earlier throws himself into the audience aang looks at his hand and quickly hides it behind his back
crawling back on his feet i suggest you leave he waves them away with a gesture of his hand youre not welcome here avatar
katara turns to face the mayor
why not aang helps people
landing beside katara its true im on your side
camera zooms in slowly on the mayor
calmly i find that hard to swallow raising his voice considering what you did to us in your past life it was avatar kyoshi she murdered our glorious leader chin the great
utterly shocked you think that i  murdered someone
lisping and slurring we used to be a great society before you killed our leader pointing at himself as the camera zooms in on him now look at us
the villagers next to him look at him in disgust
frightened by the appearances of the old man huh
katara places her arms on aangs shoulders and starts to defend him aang would never do something like that no avatar would shaking her head in disapproval before pointing an accusing finger at the villagers and its not fair for you all to question his honor
raising his arm to emphasize his remark lets tell her what we all think of the avatars honor
he turns around to shake his rear at aang and blows a raspberry the villagers cheer in approval
give me a chance to clear my name
the only way to prove your innocence is to stand trial
confidently ill gladly stand trial
youll have to follow all our rules that includes paying bail
no problem
closeup of aangs face his confident look quickly disappears as the camera cuts to the next shot where he is cuffed with his hands and head stuck in a wooden panel and thrown behind bars katara holds her hand before her eyes in shame while sokka leans against the prison bars his arms are crossed and he looks annoyed at aang
apologetically how was i supposed to know they wouldnt take water tribe money
cut to a panning down shot of the panoramic view of the village the frame freezes for a moment on the open prison courtyard where aangs tunic is clearly visible switch to a shot from inside the prison where sokka katara and momo are still standing before the chained up aang
so some people dont like you big deal theres a whole nation of firebenders who hate you now lets bust you out of here
i cant
upbeat sure you can a little theatrically jumps back and pretends to airbend by blowing air katara looks ashamed for her brother he moves to the back of the room to cut the air swishswishswish he makes a grotesque movement with his arm before thrusting his face in the camera airbending slice he resumes his place beside katara who is still looking annoyed by her brother he makes a circular motion with his hands and points toward the door and were on our way
aang looks at sokka with big eyes
slightly mocking i think what master swish is trying to say serious tone as she looks at aang is that youre supposed to be out saving the world you cant do that locked up in here
unhappy i cant do that with people thinking im a murderer either i need you guys to help prove my innocence
howre we gonna to do that the crime happened over three hundred years ago

bragging everyone wanted to blame it on the polar leopard but i figured out it was old man jarko wearing polar leopard boots katara holds her hand to her brow annoyed by sokkas monologue see a real eight hundredpound polar leopard would have left much deeper tracks aang is making fun of sokka katara holds her hand to her mouth to refrain herself from bursting out in laughs okay i guess i am pretty good

the mayor leaves katara and sokka alone to investigate things further sokka moves in to examine the statue from every possible angle while katara looks curiously at him sokka is investigating the base of the statue when something catches his attention he looks through his magnifying monocle in order to take a better look at the right foot of the statue his eyes widen as he makes a discovery he swiftly runs over to the shrine that is facing the statue and examines the stone it is made of
this temple and this statue were cut from the same stone runs back over to the statue and we know that the statue was built after chin died
excitedly drawing her conclusions so if they were built at the same time that means
sokka interrupts her before she can reach a conclusion
shouting shhh i wanna solve it pointing at the temple that means kyoshi never set foot in this temple

sokka clears his throat to cut her off
annoyed special outfit hat and pipe these things mean anything to you
sarcastically youre right im sorry she bows slightly in a mocking gesture please

cut to a far off shot of chin village by night the camera moves in slowly and keeps zooming forward even when the picture changes to inside the prison sokka and katara confront the mayor with their findings while aang listens intently at the bars
honorable mayor weve prepared a solid defense for the avatar we did an investigation and found some very strong evidence
while katara talks a broadly smiling sokka leans in toward aang and points at himself to emphasize that he was the one that discovered the evidence aang flashes his teeth in return
evidence dismissive hmph thats not how our court system works
then how can i prove my innocence
simple i say what happened he points to himself before pointing to aang then you say what happened and then i decide whos right everyone gasps at once horrified by this news thats why we call it justice because its just us

the camera switches view from aang to the unimpressed crowd to pan further down toward sokka and katara both with big smiles on their faces but their eyes reveal that they are fake sokka gives aang a thumbs up gesture momo sits on kataras lap looking very confused
mumbles to katara while they continue to smile hes dead

the camera shoots from inside the ground as it opens up to reveal how kyoshi made a large crack in the earth with a series of wide arm movements she bends the lava up from underneath the landmass to sever it completely as the wall of lava dies down again chunks of rock fall to the ground kyoshi spins around and creates a powerful gale right beside chin blowing part of his army away and making the rest run away in fear an overview shot shown how lava has seeped into the sea and how the island is being blown away from the mainland chin holds on to his hat as he watches the island go he screams in anger while the rocks under him start to cave an overview shot reveal how he plummets to his death in the waters below

aang smiles as he rushes forward and jumps out of his kyoshi costume to face kahchi who readies his weapon a he charges aang aang opens his fans he quickly spins out of the rhinos path and uses his airbending to lift kahchi out of his saddle and blows him off the cliff with another gust
kahchis rhino still proceeds toward the mayor who peeping over the wheel and quickly hides behind it as he sees the rhino coming toward him he squeaks in fear when the rhinos horns embedded themselves into the wheel missing the mayors vital part by inches

sokka comes down a stair between two members of the rough rhinos he adjusts his monocle so it would reflect the sunlight right into the eyes of vachir the archer turns and blindly shoots a burning arrow at sokka the arrow pierces his hat and embeds itself in the saddlebag of yehlu that is filled with bombs sokka smiles and ducks for cover yehlu notices what is going on and tosses the saddlebag away but it is too late the force of the blast smacks him and his rhino into a nearby wall as sokka covers his head to protect himself against the flying debris yehlus helmet rolls by another bag lands right beside sokka his boomerang is sticking out of it
raises his arms in the air and exclaims ecstatically boomerang you do always come back
sokka notices that vachir is aiming at him he quickly weighs his options and throws his dragonshaped pipe at the archer the pipe slides over the burning arrow and extinguishes the fire while vachir looks surprised at his extinguished arrow katara sneaks up behind him and cuts his saddle cord with her waterbending vachir slides down but his foot is still stuck in his saddle so he is dragged away by his rhino when katara whips it on its rear

aang sits up a little lao casts an odd glance at his daughter who merely eats her soup
toph is still learning the basics
yes and sadly because of her blindness i dont think she will ever become a true master
oh im sure shes better than you think she is
toph sends another fissure at him causing his face to fall into the soup everybody stops eating aang rubs some soup out of his eyes and sneezes on purpose sending the food flying at the beifong family
angrily whats your problem

she lets go of her fathers hand and walks back to the ring xin fus wrestlers prepare to leave with the boulder holding aangs cage on his shoulder toph bends up a small part of the ring to stop them from leaving

the boulder takes issue with that comment
the hippo throws the cage to the side katara and sokka prepare to strike but toph stops them
wait listens to their vibrations as they run toward her turns head to sokka theyre mine
the water tribe siblings watch in surprise she shakes the ring up shooting back the oncoming wrestlers she enters the resulting dust crowd unnerving lao
toph creates a large cloud of dust walks in and encounters the fire nation man who takes some time to notice her as he moves his foot to attack she smirks he fires an wave of earth at her which she dodges she bends up part of the ring and sends her own wave ejecting him from the ring as he slams against the sidelines and lands on the ground lao and yu watch from the sidelines in shock
katara and sokka try to release aang sokka repeatedly bangs a rock against the cage
hit it harder
im trying
the gecko crawls along the floor and becomes aware of tophs presence he fires two rocks which she easily dodges she bends up a series of pillars sending him flying out of the ring cut to a disoriented fire nation man who slowly gets up before he realizes the gecko heading to him and he crashes into him the gopher tunnels and behind toph and sends a rock at tophs head she grabs the rock and returns it cut to the gopher turning to a distressed look before he gets knocked out of the ring and right into fire nation man and the gecko sokka finally breaks the cage open releasing aang who prepares to fight sokka shakes his head and calls his attention to the battle already going on the boulder and the hippo prepare to attack toph lao looks on the fight biting his nails headhunter flies in from behind to complete the ambush however toph hears him and turns the center of the ring around to put headhunter on a collision course with the other two wrestlers with the three men down toph ejects them all onto the other defeated wrestlers
i never knew your daughters amazing
toph clears the dust cloud only her and xin fu remain in the ring cut to toph who spits a quick shot of her father who looks shocked at her lack of manners and yu and gets into a fighting stance and they circle the central ring xin fu fires several rocks at her she brings up an earth shield deflecting them all she turns part of the shield on him he dodges one piece but when he hits the ring again toph picks up his vibrations in it and senses an attack she dodges a rock and creates a fissure sending him flying out of the ring between yu and lao sokka collapses in shock at the sight aang and katara are left amazed and run toward her cut back to yu and lao
shes the greatest earthbender ive ever seen
the scene fades to that night at the beifong estate toph confronts her parents
dad i know its probably hard for you to see me this way but the obedient little helpless blind girl that you think i am just isnt me i love fighting i love being an earthbender and im really really good at it i know ive kept my life secret from you but you were keeping me secret from the whole world you were doing it to protect me but im twelve years old and ive never had a real friend so now that you see who i really am i hope it doesnt change the way you feel about me

fade to credits
the episode begins with zuko by himself riding his stolen ostrich horse through a fairly barren landscape after walking for a bit they arrive at a decrepit bridge over a ravine that breaks as they cross after regaining control they continue crossing a little while later zuko smells food and spots a steak being cooked by a couple below the ridge he is walking on he holds his stomach in hunger and reaches for his dual dao swords preparing himself to steal from them however after noticing that the woman is pregnant he stops himself and continues on his way
riding through grasslands covered in large broken earth kingdom rocks zuko holds his water pouch to his lips for a drink only to finish it off thirstily exhausted from his travels his sight becoming blurry and his eyes closing slowly as he struggles to maintain consciousness he shakes himself awake only to close his eyes again moments later he has a flashback of a beautiful middleaged woman in a cloak turning and walking away in a dark hallway he opens his eyes but keeps his head down
under the hot sun zuko reaches a small poor town where the buildings are mostly made of wood and seem to be poorly constructed we come upon four men dressed in green gambling
come on spider snakeeyes he rolls a pair of dice and they land with two fives faceup ha ha yeah
two of the other men turn around and punch him in the stomach once each he grunts with each punch
zuko rides through town and passes the soldiers their leader gow glares at him and zuko glares back zuko stops gets off of his ostrich horse and turns to a merchant at a store
could i get some water a bag of feed and something hot to eat zuko holds out his hand in it are two coins
not enough here for a hot meal i can get you two bags of feed
zuko looks down disappointed he notices that the four earth kingdom men are watching him
two children hide behind the store counter looking amused one of them giggles and throws an egg it hits a gambling soldier
ow
the two boys run off as the earth kingdom soldier turn around looking angry they only see zuko behind them so they stand up indignantly
hey you throwing eggs at us stranger
no
you see who did throw it
turns to face them no
that your favorite word no
egg had to come from somewhere
turns around maybe a chicken flew over
the earth kingdom soldier laughs and gow glares at him at that moment the store owner returns with zukos feed bags for the ostrich horse gow goes to the counter and grabs both bags before he can take them
thanks for your contribution the army appreciates your support he throws the bags to one of his fellow soldiers you better leave town penalty for stayins a lot steeper than you can afford stranger trust me he pats his hammer at his side menacingly
the soldiers turn and leave with the bags
those soldiers are supposed to protect us from the fire nation but theyre just a bunch of thugs
zuko walks toward his ostrich horse as he is about to remount one of the little boys from earlier pops up from behind the animal
thanks for not ratting me out
zuko ignores the boy gets on his steed and starts riding away lee casts him an annoyed look before brightening lee comes up from behind and grabs the reins
ill take you to my house and feed your ostrich horse for you come on i owe you lee leads the way pulling along the animal
a shot of zuko holding his stomach in hunger fades to a pig farm zuko and lee arrive on a dirt road at the farm among mountains in the countryside a little wooden farmhouse with a roof that needs reshingling several different types of hybrid pigs spotted in enclosures
no one can ever sneak up on us
no kidding
lee takes the ostrich horse away zuko casts his glance off to the side the camera shifts to show a pig rooster who crows at him a man approaches zuko a woman peers out from behind the farmhouse
you a friend of lees
lee comes running out of the barn excitedly and grabs his fathers arm
this guy just stood up to the soldiers by the end he practically had them running away
the woman from earlier comes forward to join her husband and son wiping her hands on a rag
does this guy have a name
nervously im  uh 
offcamera he doesnt have to say who he is if he doesnt want to sela cuts to shot of him standing with his family anyone who can hold his own against those bully soldiers is welcome here those men should be ashamed to wear earth kingdom uniforms
the real soldiers are off fighting the war cuts to shot of lee like lees big brother sensu pause suppers going to be ready soon would you like to stay
i cant i should be moving on the wife frowns and casts a glance at her husband
gansu could use some help on the barn why dont you two work for a while and then well eat
zuko nods in agreement the camera fades to zuko and gansu working on the roof of the barn lee is resting on a ladder watching them reshingle the roof while gansu is doing well and working steadily zuko has several twisted and broken nails in front of him although it is evident he is trying hard to do a good job
you dont seem like youre from around here
shaking his head mmmm
where are you from then
lowers his hammer far away
ohhh where are you going
lee give it a rest stop asking the man personal questions got it
disappointed and rests his head on his arm he sighs yes pause so howd you get that scar
zuko is surprised at the question and swings down his hammer a little too hard he strikes his thumb now red and groans in pain
its not nice to bother people about things they might not want to talk about a mans past is his business
gansu goes back to hammering and so does zuko the scene fades away to the sound of hammers hitting metal as zuko starts reminiscing about the past
fade to a shot of the waters surface an unknown person places a fingertip in the water and holds their hand out to reveal bread crumbs cuts to shot of the royal gardens two figures sitting by the edge of a large kidneyshaped pond cuts to shot of a younger zuko and his mother who are feeding some bread to four turtle ducks  a mother and her four babies
hey mom want to see how azula feeds turtle ducks zuko throws the rest of the loaf of bread into the water and hits one of the baby turtle ducks ursa is shocked
zuko why would you do that
after the baby turtle duck surfaces again the mother turtle duck charges forth and bites zukos ankle hard
ow ow ow ouch ursa removes the turtle duck from zuko and gently throws her back into the pond where she swims off with her babies zuko is pouting
stupid turtle duck why shed do that
zuko thats what moms are like puts her arm around zuko if you mess with their babiesshe playfully bites behind zukos ear theyre gonna bite you back they laugh
a little while later young azula ty lee and mai are playing together in the royal yard by a manmade river and a rather large fountain while mai sits and watches under the shade of a tree azula does a complicated flip but messes up the ending and grunts ty lee does the same flip only she completes the ending perfectly and lands on her feet arms proudly up in the air azula pushes her over and laughs
ugh azula
zuko and ursa walk by together nearby mai sees them smiles turns away and blushes azula notices her obvious crush however and turns to ty lee with a plot in mind
whispering in ty lees ear as her friend giggles watch this runs toward her mother and zuko mom can you make zuko play with us we need equal teams to play a game
i am not cartwheeling
you wont have to rolls her eyes cartwheelings not a game dumdum
i dont care i dont want to play with you
we are brother and sister its important for us to spend time together dont you think so mom shoots her mother an innocent smile
places her hands on zukos shoulder yes darling i think its a good idea to play with your sister ruffles his hair go on now just for a little while walks away with zuko glaring at his sister
azula reaches for an apple on the tree that mai was under earlier mai now standing in front of the fountain is still while azula places the apple on her head
offcamera heres the way it goes after placing apple on mais head she runs back several feet now what you do is try to knock the apple off the other persons head like this azula shots a small jet of flame to the apple with her firebending and knowingly sets it on fire
zuko is shocked and runs forward toward mai who screams as zuko approaches her he slams into her and the both of them fall into the fountain with zuko lying on top of mais stomach both seem very shocked and embarrassed azula starts laughing at them
lays a hand on ty lees shoulder see i told you it would work
cuts to shot of azula and ty lee observing zuko and mai in the fountain their backs facing the camera
aww theyre so cute together
zuko gets up angrily and leaves the fountain mai stands up as well
you two are such  ugh
at that moment ursa comes from the house toward the children a scroll of paper in her hand
i was just coming to get you uncle iroh sent us a letter from the warfront zuko stomps past her leaving small puddles behind him as he goes youre soaking wet
raises hands in frustration girls are crazy
the scene switches to the letter and what is occurring with iroh rubble surround a large gap in the wall of ba sing se with smoke emitting from everywhere a tent is set up nearby with a younger general iroh writing at a desk
voiceover if the city is as magnificent as its wall ba sing se must be something to behold i hope you all may see it someday if we dont burn it to the ground first laughs
switch back to ursa zuko and azula the children are laughing at the joke as well ursa continues down the letter
until then enjoy these gifts
two servants dressed in white come up and zuko runs to meet them ursa sits there and continues reading
for zuko a pearl dagger from the general who surrendered when we broke through the outer wall note the inscription and the superior craftsmanship
zuko picks up the dagger admiringly unsheathes it and reads the inscription never give up without a fight
and for azula a new friend she wears the latest fashion for earth kingdom girls
as ursa reads azula picks up her present it is a doll wearing green she picks it up by the head with disgust making sounds and sticking out her tongue
if uncle doesnt make it back from war then dad will be next in line for fire lord wouldnt he
azula we dont speak that way it would be awful if uncle iroh didnt return and besides fire lord azulon is a picture of health
how would you like it if cousin lu ten wanted dad to die
i still think our dad would make a much better fire lord than his royal tealoving kookiness sets the dolls head on fire
flashback ends night has fallen and zuko is sleeping on a pile of hay inside the barn a door opens and lee comes sneaking in he takes the dual dao swords but nearly stops when zuko makes a sound in his sleep nevertheless lee walks out of the barn with the swords and closes the squeaky door zukos eyes pop open as if he was only feigning sleep the whole time cut to a large sunflower garden where lee is practicing with the swords he jumps around and chops off several sunflower heads he starts stabbing a nearby dead tree trunk repeatedly his tongue lolling out of his mouth and breathes heavily in effort as zuko silently approaches behind him
youre holding them wrong
lee falls backward in surprise the shot shows zuko arms crossed standing a little further back in the patch of sunflowers lee gets back up ashamed and holds out the swords to zuko he takes them
keep in mind these are dual swords two halves of a single weapon dont think of them as separate cause theyre not theyre just two different parts of the same whole
zuko swings around the swords carefully demonstrating his skill he cuts off some sunflower heads turns around and hands the swords back to lee to try lee is a little more careful this time and a little less awkward with the swords he turns to zuko once he is done his mini demonstration zuko smiles kindly lee smiles back and laughs they begin walking away from the sunflower patch together side by side under the full moon
i think youd really like my brother sensu he used to show me stuff like this all the time
fade to the morning at the pig farm zuko mounts his ostrich horse again ready to leave the hospitable family gansu sela and lee have all come to see zuko off
reaches up and offers zuko a package here this ought to get you through a few meals
zuko is just about to grab the package when he looks up and notices a cloud of dust in the distance it is gow and his cronies riding in on ostrich horses gansu steps forward
what do you think they want
trouble
gow and his crew ride toward the pig farm the animals squeal clearly irritated at their arrival the earth kingdom soldiers stop right in front of gansus family and zuko
what do you want gow
just thought someone ought to tell you that your sons battalion got captured to his fellow soldiers you boys hear what the fire nation did with their last group of earth kingdom prisoners
dressed em up in fire nation uniforms and put em on the front line unarmed the way i heard it spits on the ground then they just watched
angrily you watch your mouth
gow rides forward a little more toward gansu when zuko goes in between them interfering gow and zuko glare at each other
why bother rooting around in the mud with these pigs
gow turns around his ostrich horse and all four soldiers ride away kicking up a cloud of dust behind them cut to another one of zukos flashbacks in the palace grounds again and to the fountain seen earlier zuko and azula are happily playing together while ursa sits in front of the fountain when a messenger in white approaches her with a scroll she opens and reads it before standing up and crying she turns to young zuko and azula
iroh has lost his son your cousin lu ten did not survive the battle
zuko seems shocked and sad at the news while azula does not seem to react at all cut back to the present where zuko is still in front of the family protectively sela and gansu are hugging behind him lee is standing close by
whats going to happen to my brother
im going to the front im going to find sensu and bring him back
sela and gansu walk away from zuko with sela crying desperately lee runs toward zuko
when my dad goes  will you stay
no i need to move on
zuko reaches behind him and takes out a sheathed dagger he bends down and gives it to lee who takes it with a faint smile
here i want you to have this read the inscription
unsheathes the dagger made in earth kingdom
the other one
never give up without a fight
with that zuko rides away from lee lee runs after him for a little bit but stops shortly afterward cut to zukos memory again this time he is in the royal palace playing with his dagger from iroh the one he just gave to lee he fakes his death dramatically falling to the floor with a groan azula sits crosslegged behind him
you waste all your time playing with knives youre not even good
put an apple on your head and well find out how good i am
by the way uncles coming home
does that mean  we won the war
no it means uncles a quitter and a loser
what are you talking about uncles not a quitter
oh yes he is he found out his son died and he just fell apart a real general would stay and burn ba sing se to the ground not lose the battle and come home crying
how do you know what he should do hes probably just sad his only kid is gone forever
at that moment ursa appears in the doorway
your father has requested an audience with fire lord azulon best clothes hurry up
zuko runs past ursa quickly to get ready while azula walks rather slowly
in a bored tone fire lord azulon  cant you just call him grandfather hes not exactly the powerful fire lord he used to be someone will probably end up taking his place soon
angrily young lady not another word
azula runs past her mother and leaves
what is wrong with that child
the scene changes to the fire lords chamber a large room with many columns and a wall of fire in front of the fire lords throne ozai ursa zuko and azula are all sitting on the floor some distance back from fire lord azulon though ozais face remains obscured save for his mouth
and how was it greatgrandfather sozin managed to win the battle of han tui
confusedly greatgrandfather won  because 
because even though his army was outnumbered he cleverly calculated his advantages the enemy was downwind and there was a drought their defenses burned to a crisp in minutes
correct my dear now would you show grandfather the new moves you demonstrated to me
azula stands up and moves forward she begins with some circular motions warms herself up and firebends ozai smiles azula does many fairly complicated moves with ease and zuko watches her in amazement she finishes off her routine with a jump and a powerful fire blast toward the throne before landing on her feet gracefully
shes a true prodigy just like her grandfather for whom shes named
sits back down and looks at zuko out of the corner of her eye and whispers youll never catch up 
stands up angrily id like to demonstrate what ive been learning
ozai frowns at this news zuko starts off well doing the same circular motions as azula earlier he manages to produce a small fire blast which does not impress fire lord azulon when he tries to create another one he falls he gets back up panting heavily and tries again only to fall harder ursa gets up worriedly and approaches zuko to comfort him
i failed
no i loved watching you thats who you are zuko someone who keeps fighting even though its hard
prince ozai why are you wasting my time with this pomp just tell me what you want everyone else go
ursa zuko and azula start walking out of the throne room however azula pulls zuko off to the side just before they exit the children hide in the curtains at the back of the room
what are you 
shh
azula and zuko stop where the curtains open and peek back out at the throne room exposing only their faces
father you must have realized as i have that with lu ten gone irohs bloodline has ended after his sons death my brother abandoned the siege at ba sing se and who knows when he will return home but i am here father and my children are alive
say what it is you want
father revoke irohs birthright i am your humble servant here to serve you and our nation use me
you dare suggest i betray iroh my first born directly after the demise of his only beloved son i think iroh has suffered enough but you  your punishment has scarcely begun
azulons anger causes the flames around him to grow zuko scared runs away from behind the curtain as azula watches but she stays and continues watching with an evil smile on her face
the scene switches to zuko laying in a large bed in a large ornate room he suddenly looks up alarmed azula is standing in his doorway arms crossed she looks amused
singsongy dads going to kill you seriously really he is
haha azula nice try
fine dont believe me but i heard everything grandfather said dads punishment should fit his crime imitates azulon you must know the pain of losing a firstborn son by sacrificing your own
liar
im only telling you for your own good i know maybe you could find a nice earth kingdom family to adopt you
stop it youre lying dad would never do that to me
ursa appears in the doorway of zukos room
your father would never do what to you what is going on here
i dont know 
its time for a talk
ursa drags azula away from zukos bed and azula follows reluctantly zuko clasps the blanket tightly in his hands
chanting in a low voice azula always lies azula always lies
cut to the older zuko lying in green grass holding his travelers hat to his chest
azula always lies
an ostrich horse can be heard zuko sits up and looks to see sela riding toward him in a carriage she is frantic and panicked
you have to help its lee  the thugs from town came back as soon as gansu left when they ordered us to give them food lee pulled a knife on them i dont even know where he got a knife then they took him away begins to sob they told me if hes old enough to fight hes old enough to join the army i know we barely know you but 
stands up dramatically ill get your son back
back in the earth kingdom town it is sunset zuko is riding on his ostrich horse through a small archway that enters into the town the people around scatter when they see him coming lee is tied up to a tower he seems sad but when he looks up to see zuko he quickly regains hope
hey there he is i told you hed come
the earth kingdom soldiers approach him as does their leader gow zuko dismounts and takes off his hat placing it on the ostrich horse they face each other battle imminent
let the kid go
laughs loudly but quickly regains composure who do you think you are telling us what to do
it doesnt matter who i am but i know who you are youre not soldiers youre bullies freeloaders abusing your power mostly over women and kids you dont want lee in your army  youre sick cowards messing with a family whos already lost one son to the war
to a fellow soldier are you gonna let this stranger stand there and insult you like this
the soldier runs forward spear in hand he goes to attack zuko who pulls out his sword and punches the other man in the stomach with the hilt without fully unsheathing his sword zuko resheathes his sword while the man slides backward and runs away panting heavily in fear
a second earth kingdom soldier groans and runs to attack zuko with his spear this time zuko punches the spear upward to move it out of the way grabs onto the mans forehead and shoves him to the ground the man gets up slowly and flees as well
a third earth kingdom soldier charges toward zuko with his spear as well zuko stands there waiting until the spear is close enough and kicks the spear right in the middle snapping it the spearhead along with half of the spear goes flying in the other direction the soldier gasps and runs away from zuko like the two men before him lee laughs in satisfaction a crowd has gathered selas worried face is one of many
with the last of his cronies gone gow steps up to the plate to fight zuko dual hammers against dual swords they draw their weapons and gow throws the first blow a rock he has earthbent and powerfully thrusts over to zuko zuko deflects it readily with his swords gow strikes again this time with three large rocks instead of one he sends them over in rapid succession to zuko who deflects the first two easily however the third rock hits him in the stomach and he stumbles backward this does not dismay him though so he charges gow an old man in the crowd cheers him on
give him a left a left
its not a fistfight 
hes got a left sword dont he
gow does the same earthbending trick as earlier he throws three large rocks at zuko zuko responds the same as before deflecting the first two but the third one hitting him square in the abdomen however this time he falls over and somersaults backward and manages to get up although weakened and still stumbling around gow smiles
look out
behind you
gow earthbends again but with increasingly larger rocks each time he shoots four rocks at zuko who manages to destroy each one by one it continues this way gow no longer giving little recovery breaks to zuko both are fighting at full force although zuko is so busy being defensive of the large flying rocks that he cannot become offensive to gow however finally gow creates a rockalanche and directs it at zuko the crowd gasps collectively zuko is sent flying and lands straight on his back and has a sudden flashback
in the flashback zuko is sleeping in his room at night when a hand gently touches his shoulder he awakens drowsily to see his mother dressed in a cloak
 mom
zuko please my love listen to me everything ive done ive done to protect you
she pulls the barely conscious zuko into a hug
remember this zuko no matter how things may seem to change never forget who you are
she turns away from him with a sad smile pulls her hood up and disappears down the dark hallway it is the flashback zuko had at the very beginning of the episode
the flashback ends as suddenly as it begin and we cut back to zuko in the earth kingdom village lying on the ground gow is approaching him
whispers worriedly get up 
gow raises his hammers to deliver the final blow when zukos eyes open he reaches for his swords and gets up firebending creating a hurricane of flame gow drops his hammers and is pushed over and lands on his back zuko stands there seething at gow although unarmed gow stands up and raises his fists determined to finish the fight zuko charges him sending various fire blasts gow tries to deflect them with earthbending but the blasts are too powerful and he is sent backward again rocks hit his head as he lands in with a cloud of dust
who  who are you
my name is zuko son of ursa and fire lord ozai prince of the fire nation and heir to the throne
liar i heard of you youre not a prince youre an outcast his own father burned and disowned him
zuko kneels down toward gow who shudders in fear however zuko does nothing to harm him he only takes lees dagger back zuko walks toward lee to give it back but sela who had been untying lee intervenes
not a step closer
zuko kneels down in front of sela with lee peeking around his mothers back offering the knife its yours you should have it
no i hate you
zuko has another flashback it is probably early morning and he is in his bed in his room he wakes with a start
mom zuko leaps out of bed and runs out of his room down the hallway mom mom
zuko enters a pillared room where azula is admiring zukos dagger from behind a pillar she resheathes it and steps out to face zuko
wheres mom
no one knows oh and last night grandpa passed away
not funny azula youre sick and i want my knife back now zuko tries to grab it but misses as azula quickly moves out of the way and loudly grunts
tauntingly whos going to make me mom
zuko dashes forward and grabs his knife from azula who was dangling in a tantalizing manner he runs away to keep looking zuko reaches the garden where his father is standing still staring into a pond
where is she
ozai does not acknowledge that he has heard zuko zuko bows his head
the scene switches to the palace from the outside on the stairs outside at night row upon row of people standing on the palace grounds wearing red hooded cloaks and carrying long red rectangular flags at the top of the steps to the palace a fire sage leader dressed in red with several other fire sages in white behind him there is an elaborate coffin behind him as well zuko azula and ozai are standing to his right
azulon fire lord to our nation for twentythree years you were our fearless leader in the battle of garsai our matchless conqueror of the hu xin provinces you were father of iroh father of ozai husband of ilah now passed grandfather of lu ten now passed grandfather of zuko and azula we lay you to rest
with those words two attendants in white firebend azulons coffin which was on a layer of wood so it burns easily the fire sage holds up the fire crown
as was your dying wish you are now succeeded by your second son
he places the fire crown in ozais top knot and steps away
hail fire lord ozai
ozai stands up and the group of mourners wearing red and holding flags all kneel down at once as do the fire sages behind him and zuko and azula azula is smiling wickedly at this new development zuko looks over at her and the crowd with absolute fear in his eyes the flashback ends
zuko rides out of the earth kingdom village on his stolen ostrich horse the villagers stand in lines on either side of him with various possible weapons in their hands a hoe a pitchfork a rock for throwing they watch him leave with anger and hatred in their eyes as zuko passes lee the boy looks the other way zuko ignores them and rides off into the sunset just as alone as when he arrived

i wasnt thinking that
you wouldnt even let me pour my own cup of tea
i poured your tea because i wanted to and for no other reason
people see me and think im weak they want to take care of me but i can take care of myself by myself

your nephew is very lucky even if he doesnt know it gets up to leave thank you
my pleasure sharing tea with a fascinating stranger is one of lifes true delights

fades to credits
the episode opens in a mountainous terrain at sunrise as it pans down and to the right all of team avatar is sleeping cut to aang rising and jumping up with airbending barefoot and filled with excitement
todays the day lands near a sleeping sokka can you believe it after all that time searching for a teacher im finally starting earthbending momo chitters and lands on sokka and this place momo moves on to appas head its perfect dont you think sokka sokka grumbles and glares at aang with tired eyes oh youre still sleeping huh sokka again grumbles and puts his head back down aang whispers sorry
the ground shakes causing aang to turn to look toward the source of the rumbling the camera quickly pans to the left to an earth tent the slabs of which are tossed in every direction mere moments after as the dust clears toph is standing in the middle with her left hand raised in the air
goooood morning she puts both her hands on her hips earthbending student
cut to the sideshot of appa with momo on his head sokka still sleeping and curled up within his sleeping bag with aang standing at his feet and katara who is sitting upright in her own sleeping bag toph walks over to them
good morning sifu toph
aang bows slightly to toph disappointed and tiredly hey you never called me sifu katara
scratches the back of his head well if you think i should 
sokka suddenly sits up grumbling at aang cut to a closer shot of aang who looks down in wonder and toph who has a smile on her face
sorry snoozles well do our earthbending as whispers slightly though with amusement in her voice quietly as we can
cut to a closeup of tophs feet as she slams her left heel into the ground creating a crack cut to a sideshot of sokka who had laid himself back down an earth pillar rises up right underneath him catapulting him screaming into the air cut to an aerial shot of the teams camping spot as sokka flies directly toward the camera after he has flown so close to the camera that the shot was nothing more than a closeup of this uvula the scene cuts back to ground level of the campsite where katara is standing up and joins toph and aang in looking toward the sky sokka crashes to the ground in their middle with a loud thud he immediately jumps to his feet still in his sleeping bag with only his head visible and hops toward aang while grumbling he stops in front of the avatar and grumbles to his face before jumping toward toph and doing the same to her he subsequently hops toward the camera and out of the shot still grumbling angrily everyone else turns to watch him go
cut to toph staring after sokka with her hands to her sides aang had jumped up and now softly lands beside her
excitedly so what move are you going to teach me first stretches out his right arm his fist clenched and brings it down like a hammer rockalanche he brings his left clenched fist to his right elbow while his right arm is bent upward the fist also clenched he trembles with the motion the trembler oh maybe i could learn to make a stretches both arms over his head and starts to spin around whirlpool out of land
puts a hand on aangs chest lets start with  makes the gesture move a rock
claps excitedly sounds good sounds good
cuts to another part of the canyon where toph and aang are standing in front of two rocks as katara watches
the key to earthbending is your stance youve got to be steady and strong rock is a stubborn element if youre going to move it youve got to be like a rock yourself
like a rock got it
good now the actual motion of this one is pretty simple slams the rock against the canyon wall okay you ready to give it a try
im ready tries to move it but instead he is forced backward into appa
amused rock beats airbender
iroh has a flashback in a dream about lu ten lu ten pretends to firebend at iroh who fakes a groan and falls over
i got you dad playfully jumps on top of iroh
both laugh as the scene fades to iroh in a dream sitting over lu tens tomb
my beloved lu ten i will see you again
the scene fades again as iroh wakes up to zuko calling him
uncle  you were unconscious azula did this to you it was a surprise attack
somehow thats not so surprising groans
hands iroh some tea i hope i made it the way you like it iroh takes a sip from the cup and his eyes widen he lets out a cry of disgust but manages to mask it
grimaces good that was very  uhhh  bracing he is handed another cup which he throws out secretly behind his shoulder
so uncle ive been thinking its only a matter of time before i run into azula again im going to need to know more advanced firebending if i want to stand a chance against her i know what youre going to say shes my sister and i should be trying to get along with her
with the exact opposite of zukos thoughts no shes crazy and she needs to go down zuko nods iroh grunts as he stands up its time to resume your training
back at the canyon katara and toph are standing next to the boulder aang tried to move aang walks up a hand behind his head
i dont understand what went wrong he did it exactly the way you did
maybe theres another way  what if i came at the boulder from another angle
no thats the problem youve got to stop thinking like an airbender theres no different angle no clever solution no tricketytrick thats going to move that rock youve got to face it head on and when i say head on i mean like this  jumps up and destroys the rock with her head
whoa
toph begins to walk away but katara stops her
trying to help toph teach ive been training aang for a while now he really responds well to a positive teaching experience lots of encouragement and praise kind words if hes doing something wrong maybe a gentle nudge in the right direction
thanks katara a gentle nudge ill try that moments later yelling at the top of her lungs keep your knees high twinkle toes
cut to aang carrying a large rock on his back struggling to hold it up the camera zooms out showing toph in the background stomping down and causing pillars of rock to rise underneath aangs feet as he walks aang loses his balance and falls offscreen
the next move shows toph digging through rock with her fingers the camera pans over and aang rubs his hands together and tries to do the same thing but smashes his hand against the rock and grunts in pain
rocklike
next toph gives aang one of sokkas weapons much to sokkas dismay cut to sokkas face with tophs hand holding him back he grunts trying to move forward cut to a sideview showing sokka struggling to get his club back from toph who is holding it to the side and preventing sokka from grabbing it she shoves him backward and he stalks offscreen she hands the weapon to aang he is blindfolded as he tries to smash rocks toph brings up he finally gets one after about five times cut to toph who nods in approval
during their next session toph builds herself into a shield of rock which aang has to push back over a marked boundary he is successful his training begins to move smoothly
during another training session aang is standing on two pillars of earth tossing a rock into the air while switching hands to catch it each time toph walks between the two pillars of earth and uses earthbending to shake the pillars
rocklike
the camera pans up to reveal aang holding a solid stance without losing his balance toph appears on a pillar near him and nods aang smiles knowing he is finally getting the hang of it
in another part of the canyon sokka is looking for food when he stumbles upon an animal
youre awfully cute but unfortunately youre made of meat just a bit closer  jumps but falls into a crack that is in the ground he looks at the cub gotcha sinks further in you are one lucky little meat creature
back at iroh and zukos setup
lightning is a pure form of firebending without aggression it is not fueled by rage or emotion the way other firebending is some call lightning the coldblooded fire it is precise and deadly like azula to perform the technique requires peace of mind
i see thats why were drinking tea to calm the mind
oh yeah good point i mean yes outside there is energy all around us the energy is both yin and yang positive energy and negative energy only a select few firebenders can separate these energies this creates an imbalance the energy wants to restore balance and in a moment the positive and negative energy come crashing back together you provide release and guidance creating lightning steps up and generates lightning and shoots it away from the two
im ready to try it
remember once you separate the energy you do not command it you are simply its humble guide breathe first
zuko takes a deep breath he tries to generate lightning but instead an explosion launches him back iroh shakes his head in disappointment 
back at the canyon aangs earthbending training continues
this time were going to try something a little different instead of moving a rock youre going to stop a rock get in your horse stance im going to roll that boulder down at you if you have the attitude of an earthbender youll stay in your stance and stop the rock like this stretches out still in stance
sorry toph but are you really sure this is the way to teach aang earthbending
im glad you said something actually there is a better way blindfolds aang this way youll actually have to sense the vibrations of the boulder to stop it thank you katara
sarcastically yeah thanks katara
nervously heh
cut to toph standing at the top of the hill with aang at the bottom she shoves the rock forward and it begins to roll down the slope aang looks worried and afraid as it rolls toward him he jumps over the boulder at the last second causing it to roll past and crash into the cliff toph comes running toward aang
i guess i just panicked i dont know what to say
theres nothing to say you blew it you had a perfect stance and a perfect form but when it came right down to it you didnt have the guts
disappointed i know im sorry
yeah you are sorry if youre not tough enough to stop the rock then you can at least give it the pleasure of smashing you instead of jumping out of the way like a jellyboned wimp now do you have what it takes to face that rock like an earthbender
no i dont think i do
aang its no big deal youll take a break and try earthbending again when youre ready besides you still have a lot of waterbending to work on okay
yeah that sounds good
yeah whatever go splash around until you feel better
they all exit
back to zuko and iroh another attempt by zuko to generate lightning fails
why cant i do it instead of lightning it keeps exploding in my face  like everything always does
i was afraid this might happen you will not be able to master lightning until you have dealt with the turmoil inside you
what turmoil
zuko you must let go of your feelings of shame if you want your anger to go away
but i dont feel any shame at all im as proud as ever
prince zuko pride is not the opposite of shame but its source true humility is the only antidote to shame
well my life has been nothing but humbling lately
i have another idea i will teach you a firebending move that even azula doesnt know because i made it up myself zuko smiles
back to sokka who remains trapped with the small brown animal
you probably think i deserve this dont you look im sorry i hunted you but thats just the natural order of things big things eat smaller things nothing personal but this time it didnt work out that way i admit it  youre cute okay you convinced me if i get out of this alive its a karmically correct vegetarian existence for me no meat even though meat is so tasty the cub brings an apple hey looks like my karma is already paying off thats okay i got it tosses his boomerang at it in a desperate attempt now come back boomerang
in a pond in another part of the canyon momo tries to grab a frog aang and katara move a single blob of water back and forth among each other in a circular motion
you know this block youre having is only temporary right
i dont want to talk about it
you do realize thats the problem dont you if you face this issue instead of avoiding it
frustrated at himself i know i know i know i know i get it all right i need to face it head on like a rock but i just cant do it i dont know why i cant but i cant
aang if fire and water are opposites then whats the opposite of air
i guess its earth
thats why its so difficult for you to get this youre working with your natural opposite but youll figure it out i know you will think fast throws a piece of grass at him but aang stops it with waterbending excellent you have the reflexes of a waterbending master
thanks katara sifu katara bows
katara also bows at aang back to zuko and iroh
fire is the element of power draws the firebending insignia in the dirt the people of the fire nation have desire and will and the energy to drive and achieve what they want earth is the element of substance draws the earthbending insignia the people of the earth kingdom are diverse and strong they are persistent and enduring air is the element of freedom draws the airbending insignia the air nomads detached themselves from worldly concerns and found peace and freedom also they apparently had pretty good senses of humor water is the element of change draws the waterbending insignia the people of the water tribe are capable of adapting to many things they have a deep sense of community and love that holds them together through anything
why are you telling me these things
it is important to draw wisdom from many different places if you take it from only one place it becomes rigid and stale divides the four insignias into separate sections understanding others the other elements and the other nations will help you become whole draws a circle around the insignias
all this four elements talk is sounding like avatar stuff
it is the combination of the four elements in one person that makes the avatar so powerful but it can make you more powerful too you see the technique im about to teach you is one i learned by studying the waterbenders
back to the campsite aang is meditating when toph enters holding aangs staff
aang i found these nuts in your bag i figured you wouldnt mind and besides even if you did youre too much of a pushover to do anything about it
as a matter of fact i dont mind im happy to share anything i have
you know im really glad you feel that way because i also have this great new nutcracker
she spins aangs staff above her head cut to aang who looks over his shoulder with a pained expression on his face cut to toph as she smiles widely lifts the staff and starts using it to break nutshells
actually i prefer if you didnt  crack thats an antique handcrafted by the monks  crack its a delicate instrument
its not the only delicate instrument around here walks away hitting the staff off rocks
resumes meditating ohm
hey aang have you seen
frustrated meditating here
its important its almost sundown and sokka isnt back yet i think we should search for him
well find him faster if we split up the two begin to search
back to sokka
okay karma person or thing whoevers in charge of this stuff if i can just get out of this situation alive i will give up meat and sarcasm okay sokkas warriors wolf tail gets yanked out of his hair by the cub ow thats all i got its pretty much my whole identity sokka the meat and sarcasm guy but im willing to be sokka the veggies and straight talk fellow deal aang shows up aang thank goodness have you got any meat
sokka are you okay tries to pull him out
aggh stop stop youre going to pull my fingers off and i dont think the rest of me is coming
hmmm  i bet i can airbend you out of here blows up a gust of wind but sokka remains trapped
seriously aang i know youre new at it but i could use a little earthbending here how about it
i cant  i cant do it
well if you cant earthbend me out of here go get toph
i cant do that either
you cant why not
it would just be really  uncomfortable
uncomfortable sarcastically well i wouldnt want you to feel uncomfortable 
thanks sokka this whole earthbending thing really has me confused theres so much pressure everyone expects me to get it right away it puts me in a really awkward position
awkward position i think i know the feeling
if i try i fail if i dont try im never going to get it i feel like im caught between a rock and a hard place
hmmm  how about that aang this is my friend foo foo cuddlypoops foo foo cuddlypoops aang
awww what a cute name for a baby sabertooth mooselion cub
really he looks nothing like a sabertooth mooselion
its hard to tell before their giant teeth and horns grow in what are you doing out here little guy did you lose your mama
suddenly a large mooselion appears
the scene cuts back to zuko and iroh
waterbenders deal with the flow of energy a waterbender lets their defense become their offense turning their opponents energy against them i learned a way to do this with lightning
you can teach me to redirect lightning
if you let the energy in your own body flow the lightning will follow it you must create a pathway from your fingertips up your arm to your shoulder then down into your stomach the stomach is the source of energy in your body it is called the sea of chi only in my case it is more like a vast ocean laughs from the stomach you direct it up again and out the other arm the stomach detour is critical you must not let the lightning pass through your heart or the damage could be deadly you may wish to try a physical motion to get a feel for the pathways flow like this the two begin to practice the redirection motion now are you focusing your energy can you feel your own chi flowing in down up and out
i think so
come on youve got to feel the flow they practice the motion for a few minutes excellent youve got it
great im ready to try it with real lightning
what are you crazy lightning is very dangerous
i thought that was the point you teaching me to protect myself from it
yeah but im not going to shoot lightning at you if youre lucky you will never have to use this technique at all
well if you wont help me ill find my own lightning rides away
back to the canyon aang begins to talk to the sabertooth mooselion mother
hey there we found your cub see we have no problem with you were friendly
aang this is bad youve got to get me out of here
the mooselion charges at sokka but aang sends it over his head with airbending
this is really bad please aang you have to earthbend me out theres no other way
aang tries but all his attempts produce nothing
oh no gets on top of a rock to try and distract the sabertooth mooselion woohoo look at me
the mooselion charges again but is again held off
please dont leave me again
i wont
he stands his ground and at the last second throws the mooselion back with a blast of air the beast leaves suddenly slight clapping can be heard cut to shot of toph sitting on a rock nearby
what are you doing here
just enjoying the show
what you were there the whole time
pretty much
why didnt you do something sokka was in trouble i was in trouble you could have gotten him out and helped us get away
guess it just didnt occur to me throws a nut down and attempts to crack it with the staff
grabs hold of it enough i want my staff back takes it away
do it now
what
earthbend twinkle toes you just stood your ground against a crazy beast and even more impressive you stood your ground against me youve got stuff
but
do it
aang slams the ground and sends a rock into the canyon wall
you did it youre an earthbender
i cant believe it
sarcastically awww this is a really wonderful touching moment so could you get me out of here so i can give you both a big snuggly hug
no problem sokka
actually you should probably let me do that youre still a little new to this you might accidentally crush him
yeah no crushing please
toph kicks up the rock and yanks him out nightfall hits katara meets up with them
you found him embraces sokka
the whole time i was in that hole not knowing if i was going to live or die it makes a man to think about whats really important i realized
interrupting sokka hey katara look what i can do bends a rock and slams it on the ground
you did it i knew you would whispering to toph you tried the positive reinforcement didnt you
happily yep it worked wonders
appa appa i can earthbend now the key is being completely rooted physically and mentally unmovable
appa licks him and sends him flying a few feet sokka laughs hysterically and aang laughs as well meanwhile zuko has tracked down a storm seeking lightning
youve always thrown everything you could at me well i can take it and now i can give it back yelling as loud as he can at the storm come on strike me youve never held back before
no lightning strikes tears stream down zukos cheeks and he yells at the top of his lungs
fade to credits
the episode begins with a view of the mountains the camera pans down to show a back shot of aang sitting in cross legged in a prairie on the ground looking over a vast open savanna landscape the landscape is mostly barren save for small shoots of grass which bend in the breeze a range of mountains can be seen in the distance the ground in front of aang is littered with holes
cut to a shot of the group from the front of appa sokka toph katara and momo standing behind aang the avatar is holding a thin wooden flute in both hands
whats out here
shot changes to show appa sokka toph katara and momo standing behind aang who holds a flute
puts her hand on the ground a lot actually theres hundreds of little 
turns around and silences toph shh i know you can see underground but dont ruin the surprise just watch blows a note on the flute a groundhogtype creature pops out of a hole in the ground and mimics the note yeah plays another note and another groundhog mimics it im putting an orchestra together

theres no time for vacations
im learning the elements as fast as i can i practice hard every day with toph and katara ive been training my arrow off
walks next to aang yeah whats wrong with having a little fun in our down time
even if you do master all of the elements then what its not like we have a map of the fire nation gestures to the side sarcastically should we just head west until we reach the fire lords house knocking on an imaginary door knock knock hello fire lord anybody home i dont think so we need some intelligence if were going to win this war
aang plays a note on the flute and a groundhog pops up underneath sokka and sings the note
all right well finish our vacations and mockingly then well look for sokkas intelligence aang laughs

the bartender uses two swords to slice a bowl from a large chunk of ice he cuts down some mangos from the overhanging fruit and dices them up he chops up a piece of fruit and pours a jug of milk into the bowl still using the swords he throws a decorative umbrella and straw into the bowl and serves it to zei who gives the bartender a coin

reading from the parchment the darkest day in fire nation history its got a date at the top but it doesnt say anything else he looks around making sure no one is watching before prying open the frame with his sword and taking the parchment
walks in with katara and zei sokka where are you going
running down a section of a library i want to know what happened to the fire nation on their darkest day this could be promising aang katara and zei follow him the information on the fire nation should be right up here
looking at a room full of ashes firebenders
they destroyed everything having to do with the fire nation
thats so unfair just when i think im one step ahead of the fire nation it turns out they beat us here a long time ago collapses on his knees i need to know what happened on the darkest day hears whimpering and looks at the entrance to see the knowledge seeker standing on its hind legs hello little weird fox guy
the knowledge seeker gets on its four legs and points outside the room
seems its trying to assist you
um sure i guess ill follow you
they follow the knowledge seeker to a large round door with a texture lining the bottom sides of the wall the knowledge seeker enters a small door in the texture the large door opens showing the knowledge seeker standing behind it team avatar and zei walk toward the center of the room the knowledge seeker pushes a lever beside the calendar wheel and the domed ceiling changes from day to night
this room is a true marvel a mechanical wonder its a planetarium that shows the heavens moving
the domed ceiling changes back into day
uh this is beautiful but how is it helpful
maybe these dials represent dates and times sokka try entering that date from that parchment you took
mock whispering shh katara not in front of the fox hes with the owl
the knowledge seeker whimpers sokka glances at the parchment and changes four of the calendar wheels he pushes the lever and the domed ceiling changes from day to night
wow i got to hand it to you sokka you picked the best minivacation for sure
the ceiling changes from night to day and the planetarium suddenly grows dark
hey wait what happened to the sun
narrows his eyes great you must have broken it
walks next to aang its not broken shot changes to show the sun piece of the planetarium covered by the moon piece the sun is behind the moon its a solar eclipse its literally the darkest day in fire nation history now i get it grabs aangs shoulders and shakes him something awful happened on that day i dont know what but i do know why firebenders lose their bending during a solar eclipse pushes aang back sorry
that makes sense i mean think what the lunar eclipse at the north pole did to the waterbenders this is huge
the knowledge seeker gets on its hind legs and begs
to the knowledge seeker fine you earned it tosses the fox a snack from his bag to aang and katara weve gotta get this information to the earth king at ba sing se well wait for the next eclipse then well invade the fire nation when theyre totally helpless the fire lord is going down
enters the shot from behind sokka mortals are so predictable and such terrible liars sokka gulps shot changes to show wan shi tong talking to them from the entrance you betrayed my trust from the beginning you intended to misuse this knowledge for evil purposes
you dont understand if anyones evil its the fire nation you saw what they did to your library theyre destructive and dangerous we need this information
you think youre the first person to believe their war was justified countless others before you have come here seeking weapons or weaknesses or battle strategies
we had no choice please were just desperate to protect the people we love
and now im going to protect what i love flaps his wings and the library starts shaking
what are you doing
im taking my knowledge back no one will ever abuse it again
sand pours from the ceiling hes sinking the building weve gotta get out of here
im afraid i cant allow that you already know too much pecks at them but misses
wan shi tong pursues them as they run out the planetarium the camera pans up to the surface appa snarls as the library starts sinking and the ground starts shaking
i already told you i dont wanna snuggle appa stands up and hurries away from the library toph looks at the sinking library library sinking running up to the library library sinking punches both fists into the library to stop it from sinking her feet slip in the sand so she pauses to solidify it hiyah struggles to stop it from sinking again
the camera pans down to an aerial view of team avatar and zei running through the library they round a corner and wan shi tong continues pursuing them
stops running and turns back toward wan shi tong great knowledge spirit i beg you do not destroy your vast collection of priceless tomes
aang uses air suction to move zei out of wan shi tongs attack aang fires an air blast at wan shi tong sending the spirit falling off the side of the bridge
runs back to katara zei and sokka weve gotta get back to the surface
sokka lets go

struggling whos there
the sandsailers circle appa and a sandbender jumps out cut to inside the library where sokka and aang run across a bridge and reach the entrance to the planetarium
why are we doing this
because if this calendar can tell us about eclipses in the past then maybe it can project when the next one will be
you cant possibly check every single date
adjusting the calendar wheel i dont have to we just need to check every date before sozins comet arrives because after that well try not to think about that
sokka finishes adjusting the wheels and aang pushes the lever the camera fades from the moon traveling across the ceiling to sokka adjusting the wheel calendar before switching to the ceiling changing from night to day the camera fades to aang looking at the night sky to the moon traveling across the ceiling to the calendar wheel to sokka adjusting the wheel to the sun and moon traveling close to each other to sokka trying again
pushing the lever come on eclipse

switch to a front view of zuko and iroh iroh theatrically lets out several more groans of pain zuko pull at the reins annoyed by the performance displayed by his uncle as they dismount the ostrich horse is alarmed by something zuko immediately takes on a firebending form ready to defend himself
annoyed what now
the rough rhinos ride through the thicket at both sides of the road zuko and iroh were traveling on mongkes rhino steps the ground forcefully breaking the surface mongke is shown pulling back the reigns zuko keeps up his defensive position looking at the men that surrounded them irohs face clears up as he stands up and places a hand on zukos shoulder
colonel mongke what a pleasant surprise
if youre surprised were here then the dragon of the west has lost a few steps
the rough rhinos prepare themselves for battle each readying their own weapon of expertise

the archer shoots a lit arrow at zuko he quickly reacts by knocking the arrow away and releasing a fire blast burning a hole in the surprised archers bow
mongke joins the fight by directing some fire blasts at iroh iroh deflects each and every one of them as mongke is busy with iroh zuko runs up and jumps on the back of the rhino with two spinning fire kicks he sends colonel mongke flying
iroh runs up to the ostrich horse jumps on and rides toward zuko who awaits him standing on the rhino of colonel mongke as he jumps on another rough rhino immediately starts the pursuit the rider throws a grenade at the fleeing ostrich horse it explodes right in front of it but iroh and zuko ride through the explosions smoke

katara turns around to encourage the others
come on guys weve got to stick together
sokkas clothes stick to toph he tries to free himself by pushing her away
if i sweat anymore i dont think sticking together will be a problem
an irritated toph places her hand on sokkas face and pushes him to the ground freeing them both
katara can i have some more water
okay but weve got to try to conserve it
katara bends three small blobs of water out of her pouch and into the mouths of sokka toph and momo sokka circulates the water in his mouth before swallowing it
as he points to his mouth were drinking your bending water he tries to define the taste of the water smacking his lips disgustedly he exclaims you used this on the swamp guy urch
it does taste swampy
momo lets out a sad cry in protest of the waters flavor after also smacking his lips katara sadly puts the cork back on her water sack
sad tone im sorry its all we have
not anymore look
katara looks in the direction sokkas pointing he walks over to the cactus and cuts off a piece with his machete he happily drinks the fluid thats inside while momo crawls over to him
worried sokka wait you shouldnt be eating strange plants
she drags toph along on her arm as she runs toward sokka he and momo are quenching their thirst with plenty of cactus juice he cuts open another part of the cactus excitedly offering its content to a skeptic looking katara
theres water trapped inside these
backing away from sokka and the cactus i dont know 
while cactus juice drips off his chin suit yourself its very thirst quenching though
he gives katara a big smile like a true salesman cut to closeup of his left eye as his pupil dilates rapidly he tries to shake off the feeling by rapidly shaking his head he starts to trip
in a strange echoing voice drink cactus juice itll quench ya nothings quenchier he crawls over the ground as a caterpillar before jumping back to the front pushing his face toward the camera with a big smile its the quenchiest
katara gives sokka a very weird look she grabs his cactus juice and pours it away
okay i think youve had enough
who lit toph on fire
katara wants to react on sokkas comment but is distracted by a sound in the sky she looks up to see momo flying around in circles increasing his speed before plummeting into the ground head first katara picks up and cradles the unconscious animal
can i get some of that cactus
wrapping her arm around tophs shoulders i dont think thats a good idea come on we need to find aang
katara leads toph away sokka stays behind staring blankly at the sky katara retraces her steps and pulls sokka along by his arms cut to an overview shot of the endless desert
in awe how did we get out here in the middle of the ocean
katara sighs as the scene cuts to aang flying over the desert in search of appa he blows his bison whistle
appa he glides down and lands on a dune appa
the camera circles around aang while he stares across the horizon it begins to dawn on him that he is not going to find his friend out here the tears well up in his eyes
no  yelling no
overcome by anger he slams his staff on the ground creating a large mushroomshaped cloud of sand dust that was kicked up by aangs blow washes over katara sokka and toph as they climb over another dune
what is that

the man quietly backs away from xin fu and yu
no shes not im certain her father wants her alive

cut to katara toph and sokka it is nearly twilight and they are still walking in a single file through the desert a shadow passes over their heads and aang lands behind them kicking up a small cloud of sand as the sand clears aang is still down
im sorry aang i know its hard for you right now but  we need to focus on getting out of here
she walks over to him and puts a hand on his shoulder to comfort him he pulls away

sokka and momo lie side by side on their backs arms and legs stretched out sokka smiles blissfully
pointing up at the sky why dont we ask the circle birds
katara directs her gaze to the sky and sees four buzzard wasps circling above their heads she looks at every other member in the team aang still sits down sulking and toph staggers a bit sokka sniggers a bit while momo lazily claws at the buzzard wasps
grabs her head in annoyance ugh  were getting out of this desert and were going to do it together aang get up everybody hold hands we can do this we have to
she takes one more look at the buzzard wasps in the sky before pulling aang along by his staff aang holds on to tophs hand and she holds on to sokkas in turn a big grinning sokka pulls momo along by his tail who lazily tries to fly in the other direction
the sun is setting as they all stagger up a large dune with katara still in the lead
i think we should stop for the night
the rest of the group sighs and falls down of exhaustion
is there any more water
this is the last of it everyone can have a little drink
sokka crawls toward katara with momo riding on his back when she begins to bend the water out of her pouch momo leaps forward at the water causing it to fall in the sand
theatrically panics grabbing his head in despair momo no youve killed us all
katara calmly holds her hand over the moist spot of sand and begins to bend the water back into her pouch before giving it to toph to drink
no he hasnt
relieved oh right bending
sokka let me see the things you got from the library
he immediately backs away and defensively grabs his back full of scrolls
offended what i didnt steal anything who told you that pointing an accusing finger at momo it was you you ratted me out
sokka i was there
katara takes the bag from sokka and start to examine the scrolls
sadly it doesnt matter none of those will tell us where appa is
no but we can find out which way ba sing se is we can use the stars to guide us she pulls out a map of the stars that way we can travel at night when its cool and rest during the day
she turns around and sighs at the sight of the rest of the group they are all lying there exhausted from the long walk and their grief for the loss of appa
just try to get some sleep well start again in a few hours
fade to zuko and iroh sitting at a table in the tavern at the misty palms oasis
no one here is going to help us these people just look like filthy wanderers
so do we pointing at something behind zuko ah this is interesting i think i found our friend
as zuko turns around to see where iroh is pointing at the camera pans over his shoulder to reveal an old man sitting at a pai sho table
you brought us here to gamble on pai sho
i dont think this is a gamble
zuko and iroh walk toward the pai sho table the camera zooms toward xin fu and yu who are sitting on a bench at the other side of the tavern xin fu jumps up with the intention to grab them but yu places a hand on his shoulder to restrain him
lets take them now
this place is full of desperate characters if they find out were collecting a bounty we might have to fight them all just to keep our prize patience
cut to iroh and zuko approaching the pai sho table
may i have this game
gesturing iroh to sit down the guest has the first move iroh places the lotus tile in the center of the board i see you favor the white lotus gambit not many still cling to the ancient ways he cups his hands toward iroh
those who do can always find a friend
he copies the gesture of the old man also cupping his hands toward him
then let us play
the old man places a tile on the board quickly followed by a tile placed by iroh seemingly without even looking at what the other person is doing the two man quickly place their tiles on the board zuko sits down and watches intently as the two man place one tile after the other when they are done their tiles form the shape of a lotus flower
welcome brother the white lotus opens wide to those who know her secrets
what are you old gasbags talking about
i always tried to tell you that pai sho is more than just a game
iroh rolls a tile over his knuckles and clutches it
cut to a shot of xin fu and yu xin fu ran out of patience and jumps up
im not waiting all night for these geezers to finish yapping he walks over to the pai sho table followed by yu its over you two fugitives are coming with me
quickly places himself before iroh and zuko preventing xin fu and yu from reaching them i knew it you two are wanted criminals with a giant bounty on your heads
i thought you said he would help
places a hand on zukos shoulder to reassure him he is just watch
to yu and xin fu you think youre going to capture them and collect all that gold
gold
every person in the bar looks up when they hear the word gold some of them stand up pulling a knife ready to attack
uh  maybe we shouldnt
camera shows a closeup of a grinning xin fu as he moves toward zuko and iroh two men jump in front of him to block his path with a reverse roundhouse kick the earthbender bends a rock from the ground and easily pushes them out of his way
yu readies himself for battle he sinks the first person to charge him into the ground meanwhile xin fu kicks two sandbenders away while he is lifting another one up in the air and holding a fourth one back with his other hand after he kicks another sandbender away he twists his waist sending the two men he is holding flying one of them crashes into the wall behind the bar
when there is no one left to fight xin fu and yu realize that their prey has escaped during the chaos xin fu growls in frustration and slams his two fists on the ground erecting a giant pillar of earth under a downed sandbender shooting him out of the window and against a palm tree
cut to a scorpion walking over a rock the camera shows how momo is patting the sand he used to cover up sokka while he is sleeping he jumps away as katara approaches sokka to wake him up
come on get up we need to go
sokka drowsily sits up and smiles like a drunken idiot toph also erects herself smacking her lips
yesterday my mouth tasted like mud now it just tastes like sand i never thought id miss the taste of mud so much
katara goes to aang to wake him up but he interrupts her before she can touch him
im awake i couldnt sleep
well we need to get moving if we want to get out of this sand pit
aang and katara spot something large in the sky he quickly sits up cut to a shot of a large bison shaped object floating by the bright full moon aangs expression brightens up in an instant
joyfully appa
appau200c but why would princess yue need himu200c shes the moon grabs momos tail using it to rub his cheek she flies by herself
a closer shot of the floating object reveals that it is just a small desert cloud
sadly its just a cloud wait a cloud offers he pouch to aang here fly up and bend the water from that cloud into my pouch
aang gives katara an angry look before snatching the offered water pouch out of her hands the group gazes at him as he quickly passes two times over the cloud the few remains of the cloud evaporate he throws the pouch at katara when he lands and she peeks in
disappointed wow  theres hardly any in here
lashes out im sorry okay its a desert cloud i did all i could whats anyone else doing pointing his staff at katara what are you doingu200c
she returns his attack with a shocked look on her face
trying to keep everyone together lets just get moving we need to head this direction
katara looks at her charts once more and leads the group in the chosen direction they are walking silently through the desert until toph trips and falls flat on her face aang and katara are looking at toph while sokka and momo just stand there staring blankly to the sky toph sits up and rubs her right foot
ow crud i am so sick of not feeling where im going pointing toward the little rocklike shaped object she tripped over and what idiot buried a boat in the middle of the desertu200c
a boatu200c
katara runs over to inspect the object
believe me i kicked it hard enough to feel plenty of vibrations
sokka turns around swinging like a string puppet to see what katara is so excited about katara begins to rub of the sand of the object that appears to be made of wood aang steps forward suggestively holding up his staff as soon as katara backs away aang swings his staff around creating a mighty gust of wind revealing a boat of some sort katara crawls aboard and examines it
its one of the gliders the sandbenders use and look its got some kind of compass on it tapping the compass i bet it can point us out of here aang you can bend a breeze so we can sail it were going to make it
shot of sokka laughing childishly while burying momo in the sand
cut to a shot of a small village at the edge of the desert where zuko and iroh follow the pai sho player into a flower shop
it is an honor to welcome such a highranking member of the order of the white lotus being a grand master you must know so many secrets
annoyed now that you played pai sho are you going to do some flower arranging or is someone in this club going to offer some real helpu200c
you must forgive my nephew he is not an initiate and has little appreciation for the cryptic arts
the pai sho player leads iroh toward a door with a peephole in it he knocks two times a man slides open the small window in the door and peeks through
who knocks at the guarded gateu200c
one who has eaten the fruit and tasted its mysteries
iroh smiles as the door opens to let him and the pai sho player through when zuko attempts to follow them the door slams shut in front of him he looks at the door with a pout when iroh opens the small window
im afraid its members only wait out here
an annoyed zuko frowns and crosses his arms as he rests against a nearby table he leans over to sniff the plant on the table
switch to a shot of the desert where the sandsailer is making great speed katara navigates it through the desert while aangs driving it forward using strong gusts of wind
the needle on this compass doesnt seem to be pointing north according to my charts
katara places her charts over the compass sokka sits beside her dangling his legs over the edge and holding momo by the tail who glides in the opposite direction
dreamily take it easy little lady im sure the sand folks who built this baby know how to get around here
katara looks annoyed at sokka when she focuses her attention back toward the horizon in front of her she gasps is comprehension when she sees a giant rock in the distance
thats what the compass is pointing to that giant rock it must be the magnetic center of the desert
ecstatic a rocku200c yes lets go
hopeful maybe we can find some water there
darkly maybe we can find some sandbenders
aang continues to send gusts of wind into the sails of the glider directing it toward the rock switch to a shot of the glider at the base of the rock the suns already rising when team avatar reaches the top
ahhh  finally solid ground
toph happily lets herself drop flat on her back moving her arms and legs back and forth creating a rock angel after she is done the group starts to explore the caves that decorate the top of the rock they enter a round tunnel the caves surface is covered with a yellow gooey substance
breathes deeply i think my head is starting to clear out the cactus juice and look
sokka dips his hand in the yellow goo and tastes it sharing his find with momo they both spit it out and sokka makes a disgusted gagging noise
tastes like rotten penguin meat awww i feel woozy
irritated youve been hallucinating on cactus juice all day and then you just lick something you find stuck to the wall of a caveu200c
i have a natural curiosity
i dont think this is a normal cave this was carved by something
yeah  look at the shape
closeup of her feet theres something buzzing in here camera pans up to her something thats coming for us
the camera shows how the group runs out of the cave back into the open toph and aang scream as the first buzzard wasp emerges aang pulls toph down as it flies over their heads a second wasp dives directly toward the camera
cut to a shot of the giant rock from a distance followed by a shot of the hive as more buzzard wasps swarm out and surround the group aang blasts the first wasp to come near them away with a strong air current
a second wasp lands on a nearby rock the moment it touches it toph turns around to send the wasp flying again shooting up the rock from underneath it
another buzzard wasp flies between sokka and toph she hears it fly behind her so she lifts the rock beside her and throws it in the general direction of the sound the giant rock is only inches apart from crushing sokka
surprised what are you doing that rock almost crushed me
sorry i cant tell where they are in the air
a loud buzzing signals the passing of another wasp sokka readies his machete and runs after it
i got this one
he ferociously swings his weapon back and forth at the camera
sokka theres nothing there
the camera pans back he lowers his machete looking around in search for his imagined foe
i guess my heads not as clear as i thought
cut to a closeup of a crouched up momo in the background katara backs a few steps in aangs direction
we have to get out of here im completely out of water to bend
a buzzard wasp swoops in from the sky and snatches up a screeching momo as it flies away from the hive and the benders
momo im not losing anyone else out here
full of anger he takes off on his glider in hot pursuit of momo and the wasp katara and sokka watch him go
come on were going down
they descend along a narrow ledge katara leads toph by hand
toph shoot a rock right there fire
katara places toph in the right direction toph kicks up some rocks and shoots them forward the incoming buzzard wasp is shot down taking several blows to the head sokka cheers swinging his machete in the air
yeah you got it she got it rightu200c
yes now lets move
katara leads toph on as they start to run along the ledge
shift to a closeup of aang he is still chasing the buzzard wasp that took momo a grave expression casts shadows on his face he dives emerging again straight underneath the wasp as he turns he directs a strong gust of wind at the wasp with a kick of his leg the gust forces the wasp to release momo out of its clutches momo tumbles down but quickly regains control and begins to soar next to aang aang looks from momo toward the rising sun at the horizon with an angry glare he notices that the wasp is getting away aang glides down flying close to the ground using the speed of his descent he closes his glider and swings his staff down a powerful wall of air splits the sand racing toward the escaping wasp the animal is hit in mid air knocking it to the ground with a dark glare aang just stares at the downed wasp before walking back in the direction of the giant rock momo follows him quickly frightened by this merciless outburst of power
cut back to a shot of the giant rock where buzzard wasps circle around sokka and the rest whove reached the sandsailer at the base by now katara looks over tophs shoulder acting as her eyes
on your left
toph reacts immediately and shoots a rock at her left the buzzard wasp takes the rock full in the chest shrieking on impact before tumbling down
the camera pans out showing many more wasps hovering in the air suddenly gigantic pillars of sand rise from the ground and scare off the swarm katara sokka and toph lower their arms they had lifted to shield their heads from the sand as the wind blows the dust away the camera pans to the left revealing several sandbenders aang lands before katara sokka and toph ready to face the sandbenders
cut back to a shot of the flower shop in the desert village where a sleeping zuko is startled by the squeaking of the door iroh steps through as zuko takes on a defensive stance
whats going on is the club meeting overu200c
everything is taken care of were heading to ba sing se
iroh and fung bow to each other in respect
ba sing se u200cwhy would we go to the earth kingdom capitalu200c
calmly the city is filled with refugees no one will notice two more
we can hide in plain sight there and its the safest place in the world from the fire nation even i couldnt break through to the city happily shrugs his shoulders
a bell signals that someone has entered the shop a young man approaches the group holding up some papers
i have the passports for our guests but there are two men out on the street looking for them
xin fu and yu can be seen through a small window in the door of the flower shop they are holding up a wanted poster that depicts iroh and zuko to man walking by
you seen these guysu200c
shift back to a shot of the base of the giant rock where the leader of the sandbenders confronts aang and the rest
what are you doing in our land with a sandbender sailer u200c from the looks of it you stole it from the hami tribe
we found the sailer abandoned in the desert were traveling with the avatar she gestures at aang the leaders eyes widen a bit at this information our bison was stolen and we have to get to ba sing se
a young man to the right of the leader takes a step forward and aggressively addresses katara
you dare accuse our people of theft while you ride in on a stolen sand saileru200c
closeup of tophs misty green eye narrowing as she hears the young mans voice
quiet ghashiun no one accused our people of anything if what they say is true we must give them hospitality
sorry father
tophs eye widens
i recognize the sons voice hes the one that stole appa
are you sureu200c
i never forget a voice
aangs tunic flutters around him as he charges forward threateningly brandishing his staff toward ghashiun
angry you stole appa where is he u200cwhat did you do to him
ghashiun cowers back
theyre lying theyre the thieves
with an angry frown and a growl of frustration aang smacks his staff on the ground obliterating one of the sandbenders sailers with a powerful blade of air
enraged where is my bisonu200c
the scene changes again to the flower shop where a man exits the door pulling two big flowerpots on a wooden wagon after he leaves xin fu and yu walk toward the door xin fu slams the door open with such ferocity that an overhanging plant comes crashing down he shoves zukos and irohs wanted poster under the nose of the florist
hey you where are these menu200c i got a tip that theyre in your shop
calmly as you can see no one is here but us
we know all about your secret back room to xin fu kick it down
xin fu charges the door like a mad bull and knocks it down along with the surrounding wall with one mighty kick
hey that room is for flowers only
some unlucky soul has an incomplete pai sho set
yu picks up a lotus tile that lies in the center of the room and shows it to xin fu who angrily knocks it out of his hands
lets go back to finding the girl
the scene switches to the man pulling the wooden wagon with the two large pots over some dunes zukos and irohs head emerges from underneath the flowers they briefly peek around before sinking back into their pots
cut back to the desert where aang is confronting the sandbenders
you tell me where he is now
to emphasize his order aang sends a strong blast of air toward another sailer the sandbenders watch in shock as it blows up
to ghashiun what did you dou200c
iit wasnt me
you said to put a muzzle on him
enraged you muzzled appau200c
aangs eyes and tattoos start to glow as he enters the avatar state with a swing of his staff he destroys the last of the sandbenders sailers
im sorry i didnt know that it belonged to the avatar
with the voices of all the avatars tell me where appa is
frightened i traded him to some merchants hes probably in ba sing se by now they were going to sell him there the sandbenders raise their hands as if to ward off the avatars bright angry glare please well escort you out of the desert well help however we can
the wind around avatar aang starts the swirl as his anger is reaching its peak sokka pull toph along with him as he starts to make a break for it running away from his enraged friend
just get out of here run
aang drops his staff the wind around him forms a fast moving sphere knocking up sand high into the sky as everyone runs away katara stays put staring sadly at the ground the sandstorm engulfs her and aang completely obscuring them from the sight of the others they brace themselves as the whirlwind swoops over them
aangs air sphere slowly lifts him up in the air his teeth clenched and his hands cramped with rage katara grabs his right arm preventing him from rising any further the terrible face of an outraged avatar looks down upon her only to be met by kataras sincere sad expression she pulls him back to the ground and presses him close against her chest sokka and toph lower their arms as the wind becomes less violent tears are streaming down the avatars glowing eyes katara tries her best to hold on as her own tears well up the air sphere slowly dissolves away as aang leaves the avatar state his rage subsides to make room for pure heartbreaking sadness
fade to credits
the team is situated at the waterfall pond sokka is surveying a map toph is sitting with her feet in the water moving it back and forth aang is swimming while katara is located at the top of the lake near the waterfall aang goes underwater for a moment and bends an ice cube around himself for amusement
excitedly waterbending bomb yeah jumps into the water
the splash sends aang out of the water breaks his ice prison and soaks sokka toph and the maps which he tried to protect
sarcastically sure five thousand yearold maps from the spirit library just splash some water on em
sorry wrings her hair dry and bends the water off the map
so did you figure out what route were going to take
okay we just got out of the desert so we must be around here and we need to go to ba sing se which is here it looks like the only passage connecting the south to the north is this sliver of land called the serpents pass
you sure thats the best way to go
its the only way i mean its not like we have appa to fly us there
quietly shush up about appa cant you at least try to be sensitive
katara its okay i know i was upset about losing appa before but i just want to focus on getting to ba sing se and telling the earth king about the solar eclipse
surprised oh  well okay im glad youre doing better
then to ba sing se we go no more distractions
suddenly three refugees arrive
hello there fellow refugees
so you guys are headed to ba sing se too
sure are were trying to get there before my wife ying has her baby
great we can travel through the serpents pass together
the three refugees look up in shock
the serpents pass only the truly desperate take that deadly route
deadly route punches sokka in the arm great pick sokka
well we are desperate
you should come with us to full moon bay ferries take refugees across the lake its the fastest way to ba sing se
and its hidden so the fire nation cant find it
hmm  peaceful ferry ride or deadly pass
at full moon bay
i cant believe how many peoples lives have been uprooted by the fire nation
were all looking for a better life safe behind the walls of ba sing se
a ferry departs zuko and iroh are on board
who would have thought after all these years id return to the scene of my greatest military disgrace  turns away for a second before turning back with a floral hat on his head as a tourist
look around were not tourists were refugees sips food and spits it out ugh im sick of eating rotten food sleeping in the dirt im tired of living like this
arent we all my names jet and these are my freedom fighters smellerbee and longshot
hey longshot nods

what sort of king is he eating like
the fat happy kind at this irohs mouth hangs open as he starts to drool you want to help us liberate some food
tosses the bowl of rotten food into the water im in
jet smirks 
back at the station
i told you already  no vegetables on the ferry one cabbage slug could destroy the entire ecosystem of ba sing se security
a platypus bear destroys the cabbage cart
ahhh my cabbages he is carried away
next
um four tickets for the ferry to ba sing se please

uh  no one told us we had to have passports
dont you know who this is hes the avatar
ah i see fifty avatars a day and by the way not a very impressive costume the screen pans to show several impostors notices momo besides no animals allowed do i need to call security

that wont be necessary
next

suddenly a security guard actually suki without makeup grabs sokka

suki embraces her
sokka its good to see you
later in a different location of the station the gang and suki talk
you look so different without your makeup and the new outfit
that crabby lady makes all the security guards wear them and look at you sleeveless guy been working out
ahhh ill grab a tree branch and do a few chin touches every now and then nothing major

yeah after you left kyoshi we wanted to find a way to help people we ended up escorting some refugees and weve been here ever since momo jumps up next to her hi momo good to see you too scratches his head near his ear so why are you guys getting tickets for the ferry wouldnt you just fly across on appa
appa is missing we hope to find him in ba sing se
im so sorry to hear that to aang are you doing okay

avatar aang you have to help us someone took all of our belongings our passports our tickets everythings gone
ill talk to the lady for you
back at the desk
no passports no tickets stamps a denied stamp on aangs forehead

no exceptions if i just gave away tickets willynilly to anyone there would be no more order you know what that means no more civilization
what if we gave them our tickets
no

next
dont worry youll get to the city safely ill lead you through the serpents pass
moments later
i cant believe we gave up our tickets and now were going through the serpents pass
i cant believe youre still complaining about it
in her normal kyoshi warrior attire im coming too
are you sure thats a good idea
sokka i thought youd want me to come
i do its just
just what
nothing im glad youre coming
outside at the pass
this is the serpents pass i thought it would be a little more windy you know like a serpent huh i guess they misnamed it
look at this writing how awful
what does it say
it says abandon hope
how can we abandon hope its all we have
i dont know the monks used to say that hope was just a distraction so maybe we do need to abandon it
what are you talking about
hope is not going to get us into ba sing se and its not going to help find appa we need to focus on what were doing right now and thats getting across this path
okay if you say so
within the pass
the fire nation controls the western lake rumor has it theyre working on something big on the other side of it and dont want anyone to find out what it is
they all pass by a sailing fire nation ship a part of the rock gives out causing than to fall toph stops it from falling and lifts him back up with earthbending
im okay the rock falls to the water which the fire nation ship notices it fires
theyve spotted us lets go lets go
aang gets on his glider and deflects the fireball back another fireball hits the mountain causing several pieces of rock over suki to fall sokka pushes her out of the way toph bends out a part of the mountain to keep the rocks from falling on sokka
suki are you okay you have to be more careful come on
pretending to be sokka thanks for saving my life toph hey no problem sokka
hours later at sunset the travelers set up their camp sokka approaches suki
suki you shouldnt sleep there who knows how stable this ledge is it could give away at any moment moves her sleeping bag
sokka im fine stop worrying
youre right youre right youre perfectly capable of taking care of yourself wait oh never mind i thought i saw a spider but youre fine
back on the ferry zuko jet and smellerbee sneak up to the food storage area jet breaks the door open with his twin tiger hook swords and he and zuko take some food
guards coming
longshot fires an arrow with a rope attached to it allowing the three to slide down it longshot pulls it away before the guard notices back at the pass aang is standing at the edge of the rock looking out at the ocean blankly katara approaches him
you know its okay to miss appa aang remains silent whats going on with you in the desert all you cared about was finding appa and now its like you dont care about him at all
you saw what i did out there i was so angry about losing appa that i couldnt control myself i hated feeling like that
but now youre not letting yourself feel anything i know sometimes it hurts more to hope and it hurts more to care but you have to promise me that you wont stop caring  holds out her arms come on you need a hug
bows before her thank you for your concern katara exits
katara shows visible concern
in another part of the pass sokka stands by himself until suki approaches
its a beautiful moon
yeah it really is
look i know youre just trying to help but i can take care of myself
i know you can
then why are you acting so overprotective
its so hard to lose someone you care about something happened at the north pole and i couldnt protect someone i dont want anything like that to ever happen again
i lost someone i care about he didnt die he just went away i only had a few days to get to know him but he was smart and brave and funny 
jealous who is this guy is he taller than me
no hes about your height
is he betterlooking
it is you stupid
oh
the two prepare to kiss but sokka pulls back at the last moment
i cant
im sorry
no you shouldnt be exits
back on the ferry jet passes out food to other travelers the other freedom fighters zuko and iroh sit together
so smellerbee thats an unusual name for a young man
maybe its because im not a man  im a girl walks away
calling out to her oh now i see its a beautiful name for a lovely girl
longshot approaches smellerbee and gestures at her
i know youre right as long as im confident with who i am it doesnt matter what other people think thanks longshot
longshot nods at her jet approaches zuko and iroh
from what i heard people eat like this every night in ba sing se i cant wait to set my eyes on that giant wall
it is a magnificent site
so youve been there before
once when i was a  different man
ive done some things in my past that im not proud of but thats why im going to ba sing se for a new beginning a second chance
thats very noble of you i believe people can change their lives if they want to i believe in second chances
back at the serpents pass the travelers notice that a section of the pass is below the sea level and not able to be navigated
everyone single file she divides the water allowing everyone to walk through the drowned out path aang i need help aang helps by creating an air bubble
momos curiosity is aroused by the fish he dives in the water only to return back when he sees a large shadow the rest of them notice
what is that thing
the shadow breaks through the water breaking the divide toph quickly uses her earthbending to raise the ground they are standing on above the water the shadow is actually a large serpent which appears from the water with a shriek
i think i just figured out why they call it the serpents pass suki you know about giant sea monsters make it go away
just because i live near the unagi doesnt mean im an expert
holds up momo oh great and powerful sea serpent please accept this humble and tasty offering thank you
sokka
blasts the serpent back with a burst of air ill distract it katara get everyone across takes off on his glider
katara freezes the water to create an ice trail everyone except for toph crosses katara tries to ice up the serpent but it fails
toph come on its just ice
feels the ice but her sense of sight is restricted actually im going to stay on my little island where i can see the serpent takes out half the island okay im coming slowly crosses the ice
youre doing great just follow the sound of my voice
its hard to ignore
youre almost there
the serpent slams down the ice trail dropping toph into a struggle to stay above water
help i cant swim
im coming toph
before he can do anything suki jumps in for the save
help
toph falls below the water but suki pulls her up before she drowns
thinking it is sokka oh sokka you saved me kisses suki on the cheek
actually its me
oh  well  chuckles embarrassed you can go ahead and let me drown now
meanwhile the serpent is caught in a whirlpool created by aang and katara the force of it slams the serpent into the mountain causing it to fall back below water upon seeing the two return the rest of the travelers cheer moments later near ba sing ses wall
theres the wall now its nothing but smooth sailing to ba sing se
groans in pain oh no
whats wrong
the babys coming
panicked what now cant you hold it in or something
sokka calm down i helped grangran deliver lots of babies back home
this isnt the same as delivering an arctic seal this is a real  human  thing
its called a baby and i helped her deliver plenty of those too aang get some rags sokka water toph i need you to make an earth tent a big one toph earthbends the rock to form a tent suki come with me
back on the ferry jet approaches zuko
you know as soon as i saw your scar i knew exactly who you were youre an outcast like me and us outcasts have to stick together we have to watch each others backs because no one else will
ive realized lately that being on your own isnt always the best path
the ferry closes in on the walls 
back at the pass ying is breathing heavily as the baby delivery continues
youre doing great ying sokka wheres that water now get ready to push one  two  sokka enters  three push

the two share a deep kiss aang and momo fly to the top of the outer wall of ba sing se however aang quickly notices a large drill with a fire nation insignia heading for the wall
sorry momo appas going to have to wait
fade to credits
the episode opens where several fire nation tanks rumble across the terrain a large metal mechanism following close behind the camera zooms out to a shot of the fire nation drill slowly moving its way toward the outer wall of ba sing se several sections of the drill extend forward releasing steam as spikes are driven into the ground the drills command module ascends where inside are princess azula her friends mai and ty lee war minister qin and several operators of the drill
this drill is a feat of scientific ingenuity and raw destructive power once it tunnels through the wall our troops will storm their city the earth kingdom will finally fall and you can claim ba sing se in the name of your father nothing can stop us
looking through the telescope hmmm what about those muscley guys down there
she peers through a periscope at several earth kingdom troops using earthbending to create large trenches fire nation forces following them in hot pursuit
strikes the periscope roughly alarming ty lee please the drills metal shell is impervious to any earthbending attack
oh im sure it is war minister qin but just to be on the safe side  sharply while looking at the two girls mai and ty lee take the earthbenders out
swinging a knife around her finger relieved finally something to do rises and walks out
the scene changes to where katara sokka and toph are escorting than and his family to the city aang appears flying in on his glider with momo behind him he lands momo perched on his shoulder
surprised aang what are you doing here i thought you were looking for appa
i was but something stopped me something big
the scene switches to the base of the outer wall where aang and toph use earthbending to transport everyone up the wall
now whats so big that appa has to wait
camera zooms out to drill that
the group arrives at the top of the outer wall
despairingly we made it to ba sing se and were still not safe no one is huddles with family members
what are you people doing here civilians arent allowed on the wall
im the avatar take me to whoever is in charge
the scene changes to a portion of the outer wall where a roof rises overhead supported by tall arches an earth kingdom general sits behind a desk
happily it is an honor to welcome you to the outer wall young avatar but your help is not needed
not needed
calmly not needed i have the situation under control i assure you the fire nation cannot penetrate this wall many have tried to break through it but none have succeeded
what about the dragon of the west he got in
slightly taken aback well  uh technically yes but he was quickly expunged confidently nevertheless that is why the city is named ba sing se its the impenetrable city they dont call it na sing se laughs but subsequently turns serious that means penetrable city
yeah thanks for the tour but we still got the drill problem
not for long to stop it ive sent an elite platoon of earthbenders called the terra team
thats a good group name very catchy
the scene cuts to where the terra team is launching their assault on the fire nation drill they manage to overthrow one tank and get closer to the drill
ready  attack
the earthbenders wedge large earth spikes into the metal shell of the drill to halt it however the drills segments separate reducing the columns to crumbles the terra team narrowly manages to conjure earth shields to defend themselves against an assault of flying daggers hurled by mai she and ty lee are seen sliding down the shell of the drill the scene cuts to the side of the drill where ty lee lands gracefully onto the ground she effortlessly manages to defeat the earthbenders through an acrobatic display utilizing chi blocking
upon witnessing the defeat of the terra team were doomed flails arms in panic
slaps him across the face get a hold of yourself man
rubbing cheek youre right im sorry
maybe youd like the avatars help now
meekly stands before the avatar humbly yes please
the scene changes to where aang and the rest are overlooking the wall at the drill
the question is how are we going to stop that thing all turn their heads to sokka
why are you all looking at me
youre the idea guy
complaining so im the only one who can ever come up with a plan thats a lot of pressure
and also the complaining guy
that part i dont mind
the scene changes to where a ticket woman is inspecting zuko and irohs tickets
so mr lee and mr ummm  mushy is it
its pronounced mushi
annoyed you telling me how to do my job
approaches the ticket booth uh no no but may i just say youre like a flower in bloom your beauty is intoxicating
flirtatiously youre pretty easy on the eyes yourself handsome raorr welcome to ba sing se stamps their tickets
disgusted im going to forget i saw that grabs ticket and walks away
camera changes to view of jet overlooking zuko now under the adopted alias lee
i think lee would make a good freedom fighter hes just trying to find his way in the world like us
you dont know anything about him jet
i know he didnt get that scar from a waterbender
besides i thought we were going straight now
we are and the new freedom fighters could use a guy like lee what do you think longshot
longshot looks over at him silently with a meaningful look on his face and blinks his eyes
i can respect that
meanwhile back at the outer wall katara attempts to heal a member of the terra team
whats wrong with him he doesnt look injured
his chi is blocked stops healing who did this to you
two girls ambushed us one of them hit me with a bunch of quick jabs and suddenly i couldnt earthbend anymore and i could barely move then she cartwheeled away
eyes widen in realization ty lee she doesnt look dangerous but she knows the human body and its weak points its like she takes you down from the inside
excitedly ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh
yes
what you just said thats how were going to take down the drill the same way ty lee took down all those big earthbenders
by hitting its pressure points
looking out over the wall with a determined look well take it down from the inside
the scene cuts to the fire nation drill the camera pans to where aang katara sokka and toph are crouching together in one of the abandoned trenches of the terra team
gesturing toward the drill once i whip up some cover youre not going to be able to see so stay close to me
she steps outside the trench and with a powerful stomp of her foot sending a mass of flying debris clouding toward the drill
run
the group races into the dust cloud behind toph the scene cuts to the command module where ty lee is peering at the cloud through the periscope
hey look at that dust cloud periscope view shows front of drill and billowing cloud its so  poofy cut back to ty lee who looks away from the periscope with a spacedout expression poof
dont worry princess im sure its nothing azula casts a doubtful look
the scene changes to outside where the group is standing in the midst of the dust beside the drill toph earthbends a hole into the ground
everyone into the hole
she and the others jump into the hole and the ground above them closes shut the camera pans to underground where it is pitch black
its so dark down here i cant see a thing
sarcastically oh no what a nightmare
sheepishly sorry
they make their way to the surface underneath the drill where sokka spots an opening
there
aang leaps up to the bar hanging from the opening and dangling upsidedown from his legs hoists sokka and katara into the drill he realizes toph is not following them sokka sticks his head out of the drill
toph come on
no way am i going in that metal monster i cant bend in there ill try to slow it down out here
okay good luck he and aang disappear into the drill
toph earthbends a wedge of rock into the drill however it is proving to be a difficult task as it pushes her back the scene changes to inside the drill where sokka is leading the others through a tunnel of valves and pipes
i need a plan of this machine some schematics that show what the inside looks like then we can find its weak points
where are we going to get something like that sokka unexpectedly cuts off a steam valve with his machete what are you doing someones going to hear us
thats the point i figure a machine this big needs engineers to run it and when something breaks 
they come to fix it
aang and katara smile at each other moments later an engineer wearing a mask is seen walking down the misty hallway to the site of the damage
appears behind him hi
she freezes the mist covering the engineer in a thin layer of ice sokka runs up to the frozen engineer and takes his schematics
thisll work thanks
the trio runs off leaving the helpless engineer who drops his spear unintentionally the scene changes to where sokka and the others are studying the plans
it looks like the drill is made up of two main structures theres the inner mechanism where we are now and the outer shell the inner part and the outer part are connected by these braces if we cut through them the entire thing will collapse
aang and katara nod in agreement the scene changes to the train station where zuko iroh and the three freedom fighters are awaiting their train the camera focuses on zuko and iroh who sit in the waiting area jet approaches and sits next to zuko
so you guys got plans once youre inside the city
get your hot tea here finest tea in ba sing se
waves hand ooh jasmine please
the tea seller pours tea into a leaf cup for iroh iroh sips the tea but soon grimaces at its repulsive taste
blaugh ugh coldest tea in ba sing se is more like it what a disgrace
hey can i talk to you for a second
he motions for zuko to follow him zuko sighs and reluctantly rises the two walk several feet away from irohs spot
you and i have a much better chance of making it in the city if we stick together you want to join the freedom fighters
thanks but i dont think you want me in your gang
come on we made a great team looting that captains food think of all the good we could do for these refugees
walking away i said no
have it your way
he catches sight of iroh who is sipping his now steaming hot tea causing his eyes to widen in shock and realization zuko approaching iroh glances over his shoulder at jet who narrows his eyes and walks away angrily he knocks the tea cup out of irohs hand
hey
gritting in a whisper what are you doing firebending your tea for a wise old man that was a pretty stupid move
mourning i know youre not supposed to cry over spilled tea but  sniffs the cup is shown overturned in a puddle its just so sad
the scene switches to the interior of the drill where sokka is leading the others through a door onto a massive steal beam
wow it looks a lot thicker in person than it does in the plans were going to have to work pretty hard to cut through that
crosses her arms whats this we stuff aang and i are going to have to do all the work
turns and gestures to self look im the plan guy you two makes rapid chopchop gestures are the cut stuff up with waterbending guys strikes a heroic pose together were team avatar
katara and aang shoot each other awkward looks the scene cuts to one where the two are positioned on either side of one brace using waterbending they slice through the metal sharply the shot changes to when the brace is sliced halfway through both katara and aang are bent over and gasping in exhaustion
pumping arms in the air cmon team dont quit now katara grinds her teeth as she seethes with rage were 
explodes with frustration grrr
katara shoots a menacing glare while pulling out her water whip and threatening to strike him with it cut to sokka who stands wideeyed arms still in air
i mean recovers and points reassuringly youre almost there
the two resume work slicing the brace with every lash of the water whip the cut through the brace enlarges and sokka grows more and more eager at last a cut is made clean through the brace however to their disappointment the brace budges mere inches from its position
panting in exhaustion at this rate we wont do enough damage before the drill reaches the wall
i dont know how many more of those i have in me
the drill suddenly creaks
do you hear that we took it down we better get out of here fast
the trio run for the door only to halt upon hearing an announcement being made through overhead speaking tubes
congratulations crew the drill has made contact with the wall of ba sing se cuts to him standing in the command module start the countdown to victory
cheers erupt from the crew the camera cuts to azula a threatening look of determination on her face aang katara and sokka look at each other in shock and dismay the camera cuts to a scene of the drill hammering through the wall sending loose boulders in every direction the scene changes to one of a stream of a saturated rock and water solution traveling through tubes and making its way through the back entrance of the drill cuts to sokka who is desperately attempting to move the brace
pushing against brace cmon brace  budge makes several more attempts to move it
this is bad really bad
were putting everything weve got into busting these braces but its taking too long
struck with realization maybe we dont need to cut all the way through toph has been teaching me that you shouldnt give one hundred percent of your energy into any one strike rises sokka take a fighting stance youve got to be quick and accurate hit a series of points and break your opponents stance strikes sokka several times and when hes reeling back you deliver the final blow hits him softly on the head his own weight becomes his downfall literally
as aang is speaking sokka kneels over
so we just need to weaken the braces instead of cutting all the way through
then ill go to the top of this thing and deliver the final blow
rising and boom it all comes crashing down
everyone inside that wall the whole world is counting on us
the whole world minus the fire nation that is
sokka grins while the other two simply stare at each other exasperated the scene cuts to toph under the drill putting all her strength into keeping the rock column stable as she is slowly pushed back by the force of the drill
straining as the drill continues to push her back cmon twinkle toes hurry up
the scene changes to where aang and katara are making rapid progress slicing through several braces halfway to weaken them
thats enough we need to get to the next one
the scene changes to outside the drill where earthbenders are sending boulders down at the drill from the wall the scene changes to the command module where the war minister receives shocking news from engineers communicating through speaking tubes
war minister an engineer was ambushed his schematics were stolen
qin is clearly surprised while azula narrows her eyes in suspicion
war minister a brace on the starboard side has been cut clean through its sabotage sir
sharply lets go ladies
the scene changes to where the trio continues to slice through the braces
good work team avatar now aang just needs to  glances up in horror duck
he ducks just in time to evade the blue fire blast sent his way by azula who runs out and stands on another brace followed by her friends
barely misses another fire blast whoa
wow azula you were right it is the avatar cut to a closeup of ty lee she smiles flirtatiously at sokka  and friends
smiles and waves hey
katara approaches her brother and drags him away clearly annoyed ty lee swings herself forward toward aang who quickly airbends her away the trio escape the scene and race through the drills hallways they come to an intersection
guys get out of here i know what i need to do
wait throws him her water skin you need this water more than i do
aang catches the water skin and starts running again azula and her team reach the intersection
follow them the avatars mine
mai and ty lee begin chasing katara and sokka while azula chases after aang meanwhile the two siblings have arrived at the end of the hallway where there is a closed hatch
reads a sign nearby while sokka struggles to open the hatch slurry pipeline what does that mean
having successfully opened hatch which leads to a canal channeling slurry its rock and water mixed together it means our way out
the two begin descending into the pipe when mai and ty lee arrive they manage to escape into the canal just as a flurry of daggers is sent their way the camera cuts to a shot of them floating through the slurry mai and ty lee run over and peer into the pipeline
holds her hands over the slurry ugh disgusting
cmon you heard azula we have to follow them
she can shoot all the lightning she wants at me i am not going in that wall sludge juice shivers in disgust
ty lee shrugs and leaps through the pipeline into the slurry mai shudders with a final expression of disgust and closes the hatch the scene cuts to where aang races past several engineers through the drill the camera cuts to the rear of the drill where a flood of slurry is continually being released katara and sokka slide through the slurry onto the ground with ty lee following them in hot pursuit katara uses waterbending to stop the flow of slurry and plug up the back entrance of the drill thus trapping ty lee
hatefully and tauntingly why dont you try blocking my chi now circus freak
katara keep that up the pressure will build up in the drill then when aang delivers the final blow itll be ready to pop
the scene changes to where aang and momo have made their way to the top of the drill
halting this looks like a good spot momo looks up to find boulders being hurtled down the wall nearly crushing him yelling general sung tell your soldiers to stop shooting rocks down here
frantically soldiers whatever you do dont stop shooting rocks down there
the soldiers nod and launch another round of rocks toward the drill aang leaps out of the way of the oncoming boulders and begins slicing at the hull of the metal using water from kataras water skin the scene changes to where katara continues to hold ty lee captive in the slurry
good technique little sister keep it up dont forget to breathe
irritated you know im just about sick and tired of you telling me what to do all day youre like a chattering hogmonkey
screaming just bend the slurry woman
frustrated katara bends a wave of slurry into her brother with her free hand knocking him down into the foul muck
approaching katara you guys need some help
toph help me plug up this drain
the two cooperate with each other to bend the slurry sending ty lee farther into the drill and causing the pipes to begin to expand under the pressure the scene cuts to where aang continues to slice the metal of the drill
exhausted what id give to be a metalbender
momo suddenly shrieks and aang deflects a blue fire blast just in time
assuming a fighting stance momo get out of here
azula appears before the avatar and a battle ensues between the two azula shoots fire blasts at aang who manages to block them using airbending she continues the fire attacks only to have each one of her strikes deterred by water whips she eventually manages to vaporize the water sending aang back the two narrowly dodge the several boulders that are hurtled toward them at that moment aang uses earthbending and airbending to send rocks at azula who manages to avoid them all azula sends another powerful firebending assault that slams aang into the outer wall of ba sing se leaving him unconscious
the camera view briefly changes to where the front of the drill is seen having completely dug its way through the outer wall camera changes to azula as she walks over to him with fire in her right hand preparing to deal a deadly final strike but aang awakens and sends her skidding back using an earthbending gauntlet a flood of slurry is released as the drill bores deeper into the wall coating the two azula slides toward a helpless aang attempting to halt herself by windmilling only to collide with him the force of the collision sends both sliding off opposite sides of the drill azula is able to stop her descent by grinding her feet into the drills side while momo drags aang up to the top with the help of aangs airbending
thanks momo i owe you one runs over to the wedge he sliced in the drill now all i need  a boulder falls before him actually that is what i need for once
he uses airbending to position the boulder over the x mark in the drill using earthbending he cuts the rock several times creating a wedge that fits inside the middle of the hole he begins sprinting toward the wall scales up its side by riding an air scooter and once he arrives at his highest point rockets at lightning speed toward the bottom as he propels himself downward azula catches sight of him and fires at him she misses by mere seconds and is sent back forcefully as aang leaps and slams down on the wedge creating a large ripple effect the impact of the blow causes the sliced braces inside the drill to collapse and the pipes to burst releasing a torrent of slurry slurry begins to seep from the drill the scene cuts to katara and toph who remain in their bending stances
woohoo
here it comes
she earthbends katara sokka and herself onto a rock pillar to avoid the flood of slurry slurry gushes from the rear of the drill and ty lee slams into the wall of the rock pillar as she is forcefully pushed forward by the flood the drill begins to release steam and its segments begin to collapse on the other side of the wall the drill is seen coming to a halt
the camera zooms out on the destroyed drill the scene cuts to aang covered in slurry momo licking him as he wipes it away near his face a huge smile spread across his face cut to war minister qin who stares at the slurry from inside the command module completely shocked cuts to general sung atop the outer wall covered in the muck cuts to ty lee as she attempts to clear away the mess cut to shot of azula skidding down the drill also covered in slurry she lands by ty lee causing the acrobat to be covered in slurry once again a hatch opens revealing mai who is completely clean
dryly we lost
the scene changes to the train station

cut to long feng blowing on his own highpitched whistle long feng steps out of the shadows appa growls at him and takes a step back leaving a single footprint in the mud long feng earthbends the slab of rock beneath him causing it to swirl around and capture appa underground shot of appas footprint in the mud fades to a further shot of the dust around the slab of rock dissipating fade to credits
the episode opens to team avatars place of stay in ba sing se where sokka is drawing inaccurate pictures of appa for missing posters katara and aang enter
cheerfully we found a printer to make our posters reveals the poster and aang smiles and points at it
hey i thought designing the lost appa poster was my job ive been working all day on my appa shows his crudely drawn picture of appa with a proud smile cut to an exasperated aang while katara tries to hold back her laughter
sokka the arrow is on appas head
dismayed this is his head points to the sketch
takes the picture from sokka looks confused why are feet coming out of it
snatches back the picture indignantly those are his horns hangs his head i havent seen him in a while okay
mockingly it looks just like him to me
thank you i worked really suddenly remembering that she is blind why do you feel the need to do that
lets just stick with the professional version
sokka angrily rips up his drawing
excitedly come on lets get busy holds up some pamphlets
cut to aang and momo dropping dozens of posters all over ba sing se one poster falls in front of the camera and the scene changes to tea shop where zuko and iroh are working iroh serves tea to two customers who enjoy it they approach him
so youre the genius behind this incredible brew the whole city is buzzing about you i hope pao pays you well
good tea is its own reward
but it doesnt have to be the only reward how would you like to have your own tea shop
frontal view pao looks around concerned my own tea shop this is a dream come true

sorry pao but thats business for you am i right

uh senior executive assistant manager
iroh hands him the pot of tea and bows to the customer agreeing to the terms zuko walks by as pao walks away sadly
did you hear nephew this man wants to give us our own tea shop in the upper ring of the city
thats right young man your life is about to change for the better
sarcastically ill try to contain my joy walks outside slams door shut
as he walks outside he grabs a falling appa poster he climbs to the top of a house and notices several of them falling he searches the skies for any sign of the avatar
back at the house sokka and katara are playing a game toph is just relaxing as aang reenters
i just finished dropping all the leaflets has anyone come in with news about appa
its only been a day just be patient aang sits
a knock at the door and aang jumps up and runs to the door
wow youre right patience really pays off opens the door joo dee
hello aang and katara and sokka and toph
they approach as joo dee enters what happened to you did the dai li throw you in jail
what jail of course not the dai li are the protectors of our cultural heritage
but you disappeared at the earth kings party
oh i simply took a short vacation to lake laogai out in the country it was quite relaxing
but then they replaced you with some other woman who also said her name was joo dee
surprised im joo dee
why are you here
dropping fliers and putting up posters isnt permitted within the city not without proper clearance
we cant wait around to get permission for everything
you are absolutely forbidden by the rules of the city to continue putting up posters
angrily yelling during this brief argument aang is shown as a chibi we dont care about the rules and were not asking permission were finding appa on our own and you should just stay out of our way slams the door as she exits
that might come back to bite us in the blubber
calming down i dont care from now on we do whatever it takes to find appa
yeah lets break some rules takes out a side of the house with earthbending
momo flies out the broken side of the house and they all exit two dai li agents watch overhead from a house roof across the street 
the scene changes to the royal palace where long feng meets with that particular joo dee two dai li agents stand guard
im very disappointed in your work with the avatar and his friends joo dee i had hoped that you would be able to control this situation
i am so sorry but they dont trust me anymore starts getting upset i dont think i can keep working like this begins to sob
joo dee the earth king has invited you to lake laogai
camera zooms toward her eye as its iris dilates i am honored to accept his invitation
nods good now go await further orders joo dee nods and begins to exit long feng gets up and moves to the fireplace if the avatar keeps searching for his bison it could upset the delicate balance weve worked so hard to achieve in this city it could even cost us control of the earth king
should we take care of him
no its much too dangerous for us to confront him directly lets see if we can still handle this quietly
at iroh and zukos place of stay which is about to change zuko enters irohs room iroh is packing his clothes
so i was thinking about names for my new tea shop how about the jasmine dragon its dramatic poetic has a nice ring to it
shows iroh the flyer the avatar is here in ba sing se and hes lost his bison
grabs the flyer we have a chance for a new life here cut to zuko looking out a window if you start stirring up trouble we could lose all the good things that are happening for us
turns to iroh good things that are happening for you have you ever thought that i want more from life than a nice apartment and a job serving tea
there is nothing wrong with a life of peace and prosperity i suggest you think about what it is that you want from your life and why
i want my destiny
what that means is up to you zuko walks away the tea weevil no thats stupid
cut back to team avatar who are working to put up more posters
well split up to cover more area toph i guess you should just come with me
peevishly why because you think i cant put up posters on my own angrily takes the paintbrush of glue from sokka and throws glue on the wall she puts up a poster but it is backward its upsidedown isnt it ill just go with sokka
they all go their separate ways with toph following sokka cut to an open square where katara is putting up a poster on a stone plinth near a flowing water stream suddenly behind her she hears a familiar voice call out
katara
jet is seen emerging from an alleyway at the edge of the square katara wheels around with a startled gasp
walks closer smiling confidently i think i can help you kataras shocked blush transforms into a look of pure outrage with a sweep of her arms she bends up water from a lake directly at him while screaming in rage jet looks at the wave in fright katara ive changed
the wave hits jet sending him back quite a distance
bending up remaining water from the wave tell it to some other girl jet turns the water to ice which sends jet back to a wall
blocks the ice with his swords i dont want to fight you im here to help
throws his swords down and reaches for something behind his back katara quickly fires more ice crystals which pin him to the wall the rest of the team approaches
katara what is it
jets back closeup of jets face cut to aerial view before switching to a closer view of the group we cant trust anything jet says
but we dont even know why hes here
i dont care why hes here whatever the reason is it cant be good
im here to help you find appa opens his hand and reveals he is holding a missing appa poster
turning from the leaflet back to katara katara we have to give him a chance
i swear ive changed i was a troubled person and i let my anger get out of control but i dont even have the gang now ive put all that behind me
youre lying
walks up to jet and feels the wall he is pinned to hes not lying
how can you tell
i can feel his breathing and heartbeat when people lie theres a physical reaction hes telling the truth
katara we dont have any leads if jet says he can take us to appa we have to check it out
all right points and looks angrily at jet but were not letting you out of our sight
she stabs her finger at jet once more for emphasis eyes narrowed cut to jet entering a dimly lit warehouse which sits empty except for a few sacks and a pile of canvas and rope
this is the place i heard about
theres nothing here
preparing to waterbend in defense if this is a trap
i told you i work nearby two guys were talking about some giant furry creature they had i figured it must be appa
he was here she shows them a clump of appas fur
sadly we missed him an old white haired man with a pushbroom crosses behind the slumping aang
they took that big thing yesterday aang straightens with a shocked look shipped him out to some island about time ive been cleaning up fur and various uhhh  leavings all day
aang swiftly moves closer to the man what island wheres appa
foreman said some rich royal type on whaletail island bought him up guess for a zoo or such though could be the meat thatd be good
weve got to get to whaletail island pauses wheres whaletail island dejectedly
looking at map far very far puts the map on the ground as they all gather round here it is its near the south pole almost all the way back home
aang it will take us weeks just to get to the tip of the earth kingdom and then well need to find a boat to get to the island
i dont care we have a chance to find appa we have to try
must be nice to visit an island i havent had a vacation for years
dont you have some more hair to clean up
shuffle on i get you no more need for old sweepy 
youre right aang right now our first concern has to be finding appa we can come back when we have him
all right lets get moving
ill come with you
we dont need your help
why wont you trust me walks after sokka and aang
gee i wonder
after jet walks away was this guy your boyfriend or something
what  no
smiles i can tell youre lying  katara runs away from her
back within the city
we can take the train out to the wall but then well have to walk
dont worry on the way back well be flying
were finally leaving ba sing se spreads her arms outward in celebration worst  city  ever
smellerbee and longshot appear in the background and notice jet
surprised jet
looks at jet angrily i thought you said you didnt have your gang anymore
turns to look at smellerbee confused i dont
runs up to jet and hugs him we were so worried how did you get away from the dai li camera quickly zooms in to kataras shocked face
shocked the dai li
i dont know what shes talking about
he got arrested by the dai li a couple of weeks ago we saw them drag him away
why would i be arrested ive been living peacefully in the city
feeling the ground between jet and smellerbee this doesnt make any sense theyre both telling the truth
thats impossible
no its not toph cant tell whos lying because they both think theyre telling the truth jets been brainwashed
thats crazy it cant be glances to the sides stay away from me
they all surround him cut to the moon in the night sky cut to a dai li agent walking the streets zuko disguised as the blue spirit runs by
out of my way skinny
the agent prepares to use his rock glove but pauses when the disguised man turns into an alley the agent runs to the alley and sees a figure that appears to be him he fires his rock gloves at the figures chest and head knocking off the stuffed figures head and knocking it down
huh
there is the whisper of a drawn blade behind him and zuko still disguised captures him and places one of his swords to the agents neck
if you dont want to end up like him youll do what i say
back in an unknown building team avatar longshot and smellerbee all surrounding a seated jet
the dai li must have sent jet to mislead us and that janitor was part of their plot too
i bet they have appa here in the city maybe hes in the same place they took jet where did they take you
nowhere i i dont know what youre talking about
we need to find a way to jog his real memories
teasingly maybe katara should kiss him that should bring something back
maybe you should kiss him sokka
hey just an idea
a bad one
ooh wait ive got it
sokka plucks a straw from his mattress pokes it into jets mouth in trademark fashion and regards him thoughtfully
i dont think its working spits it out
try to think of something from your past that triggers your emotions
the fire nation remember what they did to your family
close your eyes picture it
jet closes his eyes while sweat beads start to form on his forehead his eyes suddenly snap wide open and he sees images of himself at a younger age watching his town burning down and mongke looking back at him
sweating no its too painful
maybe this will help takes water and puts it around his ears using healing to clear his mind
jet looks up from the floor and sees an image of long feng standing above a lake long feng stares at jet and jet sinks down under the lake into an underground room he sees an image of a dai li agent shining a spinning light in his face
they took me to a headquarters under the water like a lake
wait remember what joo dee said she said she went on vacation to lake laogai
stands up thats it lake laogai
fade to an aerial shot of lake laogai the camera pans down to show team avatar jet longshot and smellerbee standing at the edge of the lake
so wheres this secret headquarters
under the water i think
theres a tunnel right there by the shore
toph points to the side and whistles as she walks to the edge of the shore she uses her earthbending to bring up a slab of rock with an entrance she moves the rock out the way with the same technique they all look down at the tunnel and momo flies away cut to them inside the secret headquarters jet checks to make sure the coast is clear and they walk down a long hallway
its all starting to come back to me
jet walks past a room where a member of the dai li brainwashes a group of women
im joo dee welcome to ba sing se
im joo dee welcome to ba sing se
were so lucky to have our walls to create order
were so lucky to have our walls to create order
i think there might be a cell big enough to hold appa up ahead i think its through here opens a door
cut to appa chained up as a door opens in his cell and appa wakes up cut to zuko standing at the door disguised as the blue spirit
expecting someone else
jet opens the other door an overhead shot reveals several dai li agents waiting on the ceiling the door closes suddenly behind them lights turn on revealing the agents
now thats something different
you have made yourselves enemies of the state take them into custody
the dai li agents jump off the ceiling and surround them two agents fire rock gloves but toph breaks them up and sends the two agents flying through the air with rock pillars jet runs toward the agents and breaks two other gloves fired by agents with his swords and trips another a full battle ensues aang deals with a pair of dai li agents sokka and katara destroy two dai li gloves but a second pair grabs them
toph saves them by creating a rock wall and she raises ground up toph knocks away the four dai li agents that attack her but a glove captures her and jet swings by to free her the agent fires his other rock glove and longshot fires an arrow which destroys the glove jet jumps in front of longshot to hold off more of their rock attacks long feng escapes
knocks away two agents with airbending long feng is escaping
jet and aang chase him they head into another part of the headquarters with many pipes of all sizes sticking out of the walls with some of them pouring out water but are sealed in by long feng
all right avatar youve caused me enough problems this is your last chance  if you want your bison back
you do have appa tell me where he is
agree to exit the city now and ill waive all charges against you and allow you to leave with your lost pet
gets in a fighting position youre in no position to bargain
am i not
gets into a fighting position youre definitely not
jet the earth king has invited you to lake laogai
closeup of his eye his iris dilates i am honored to accept his invitation
jet attacks aang cut to appa growling at the disguised zuko appa tries to strike zuko but his chained feet hold him back
youre mine now
the door opens and zuko gets into a fighting stance iroh enters
uncle
so the blue spirit i wonder who could be behind that mask 
sighs and takes off the mask what are you doing here
i was just about to ask you the same thing what do you plan to do now that youve found the avatars bison keep him locked in our new apartment should i go put on a pot of tea for him
first i have to get it out of here
starts yelling and then what you never think these things through points at him this is exactly what happened when you captured the avatar at the north pole you had him and then you had nowhere to go
i would have figured something out
no if his friends hadnt found you you would have frozen to death
i know my own destiny uncle
is it your own destiny or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you
stop it uncle i have to do this
im begging you prince zuko its time for you to look inward and begin asking yourself the big questions who are you and what do you want
zuko screams loudly throwing down his swords and blue spirit mask cut to the brainwashed jet continuing to swing at aang
jet its me aang runs back you dont have to do this
im afraid he no longer has a choice
jet resumes his attempts at attacking aang who dodges them and uses airbending to knock him back jet uses his hook swords to stop himself and he pants heavily
jet im your friend look inside your heart
do your duty jet
he cant make you do this cut to a closeup of jets face as he hangs his head while panting and sweating youre a freedom fighter
at these final words jet straightens in shock everything goes white and he has a rapid flashback of his past as a freedom fighter seeing longshot smellerbee pipsqueak and the duke and him with katara the freedom fighters cheer fades to him with smellerbee and longshot before showing him sitting down with iroh and zuko fade to him giving the passengers food and quickly to him being dragged away by the dai li fade more rapidly to jets brainwashing and to long feng on lake laogai cut to his burning village to iroh to him with zuko to him with katara to him watching his burning village crying cut to him in a fire nation camp to him with katara and to him being brainwashed cut back to him crying while watching his village burn as mongke watches the flashback ends and jets irises return to normal
do it do it now
jet fires a sword at long feng which misses long feng counters with an uplifted rock which strikes jet down aang runs toward jet as long feng escapes through a pipe in the wall
escaping upward to a pipe foolish boy youve chosen your own demise exits
im sorry  aang
dont be
the rest of the group arrives all struck with sorrow and shock as they gather around jet katara stares openmouthed at jet her hands hovering near her mouth in shock snapping out of it she withdraws water from her water skin with which she covers her hands and it begins to glow as she kneels down next to him cut to a shot from over her shoulder with jet glancing at her while she rubs her hands over his chest in an attempt to heal him after rubbing his chest three times the glow fades the water stains jets clothing and katara looks back over her shoulder toward the rest of the group
this isnt good
you guys go and find appa well take care of jet
were not going to leave you
theres no time just go well take care of him hes our leader
they stare at longshot in surprise
dont worry katara ill be fine smiles a little
katara closes her eyes in painful sadness and opens them again as she rises team avatar begins to exit
whispering to sokka hes lying 
cut to a closeup of smellerbee crying longshot watches team avatar completely leave through a tunnel that is earthbent open before turning the other way to the other exit and standing guard prepping an arrow smellerbee is seen kneeling next to jet rubbing her hands back and forth over him with her right hand on his forehead
team avatar reaches appas hold only to discover that it is empty
appas gone long feng beat us here
if we keep moving maybe we can catch up with them
they find an exit back to the beach as they make their escape several dai li agents jump out from behind them
you think we can outrun them
i dont think its gonna matter
another group of dai li agents plus long feng stand in front of them all the agents box them in lifting up the ground on both sides dai li agents stand on all three walls momo flies to aang
what is it momo
momo flies to the sky suddenly appa flies down
appa
appa smashes through the rock walls scattering the dai li agents aang and toph use earthbending to knock other nearby agents off a cliff and into the lake appa confronts long feng
i can handle you by myself
long feng charges at appa but appa grab his leg and throws him skipping into the lake appa spits out long fengs shoe the team cheers and they run toward appa
yeah appa
happily crying i missed you buddy
appa closes his eyes a tearyeyed katara somberly looks over lake laogai as they fly over it on appa aang places his hand on her shoulder the team all gathers in a group hug zuko and iroh emerge from the dai li headquarters
you did the right thing nephew zuko looks at his blue spirit mask as iroh rests a hand on its shoulder leave it behind
zuko walks to the edge and tosses the mask into the water where it slowly sinks to the bottom of the lake fade to credits
the episode opens just outside the vast waters of lake laogai team avatar has stopped on a tiny islet in the center of the lake aang is embracing appa happy upon reuniting with him
i missed you more than youll ever know buddy momo flies into appa to hug him too appa licks aang which causes aang to laugh
sokka approaches katara and toph
look we escaped from the dai li we got appa back im telling you we should go to the earth king now and tell him our plan were on a roll
one good hour after weeks of trouble isnt much of a roll
we can build on it if we want to invade the fire nation when the eclipse happens well need the earth kings support
what makes you think well get it i dont know if youve noticed but things dont usually go that smoothly for our little gang
i know but ive got a good feeling about this this time will be different
sokka long feng is in control of the city his conspiracy with the dai li is too powerful i think we should just keep flying and leave this horrible place behind us
im with sweetness ive seen enough of ba sing se raises arms and opens eyes wide and i cant even see
aang flies into the shot
but now that we have appa back theres nothing stopping us from telling the earth king the truth about the conspiracy and the war
see aangs with me puts his arm around aang and smiles its the whole reason we came here in the first place we have to try
thinks for a moment well i guess if the earth king knew the truth things could change sokka and aang smile
stands up i dont trust the new positive sokka points at sokka in an accusing manner long feng brainwashed you didnt he
aang notices a few ships in the lake
thats probably the dai li searching for us to katara so
katara thinks for a moment before looking at sokka
determined lets fly
they fly toward the palace now with no saddle holding onto appas fur for dear life especially toph
can we please buy a new saddle riding bareback is terrifying buries face in appas back
they get closer to the palace
there it is that whole thing is the palace the earth kings chamber should be in the center
we have to be careful long fengs probably warned the king that were coming
why would you assume that if you ask me i think were just gonna sail right in and a giant rock almost hits them aahh
what was that
surfacetoair rocks sees more being launched more incoming
they dodge a few more rocks one gets launched right at aang but he destroys it with his hand another is launched at them head on but aang slices it cleanly in two by swinging his staff at the rock to augment his earthbending he launches himself from appa to the front of the palace and slams his staff into the ground generating a massive earthen wave to knock back the palace guards appa lands and roars at the captains ostrich horse which causes it to drop the captain and run off as they continue toward the earth king more guards appear and launch earth cubes at the gang toph and aang use earthbending to block the attacks while katara uses waterbending to subdue the guards
water whips two guards sorry
katara turns around and strikes down more guards with her waterbending though closes her right eye in a sympathetic flinch for a moment as she does so as more guards rush toward them in an attempt to halt team avatars progress toph uses her earthbending to flip the tiles of the walkway trapping them between them and ensuring a clear passage for the team
sorry we just need to get through to see the earth king
more guards appear on the opposite end of a bridge and launch two giant statues at them toph and aang create an earth igloo to block the statues katara creates an ice ramp to jump to the other side of the bridge and waterwhips the guards into the water aang freezes them in the water as the rest all jump across more surfacetoair rocks appear as guards are coming down a giant staircase toph uses earthbending to change the stairs into a ramp causing them all to fall she and aang use earthbending to escalate themselves up the stairs
seriously were actually on your guys side pauses for a moment sorry
more guards come and aang and toph push them away with earthbending
in there they enter the palace
they come to an area with three doors more guards appear and toph easily defeats them all
toph which way to the earth king
how should i know im still voting we leave ba sing se
toph defeats more guards while sokka opens the doors to find the earth king the first room is empty as is the second outside the second door a royal guard goes flying to the right offscreen sokka bursts into a third room startling a woman
burglar tries to run trips and falls flat on her face
shuts the door sorry wrong door
meanwhile zuko and iroh return from lake laogai the former seems ill
you did the right thing letting the avatars bison go free
i dont feel right gets dizzy and passes out
zuko rushes to him
back at the palace the team arrives at a pile of rubble sokka climbs atop it and sees a gigantic door
now thats an impressive door its gotta go somewhere drops down from the rubble and attempts to kick the door open yaaah the door does not move even slightly sokka starts trying to push it open but to no avail toph and aang jump in from behind and bust the door down knocking sokka forward in the process he starts rubbing the back of his head a little warning next time
they arrive in the earth kings chamber with kuei sitting in his throne long feng and his dai li agents stand in their way the team takes fighting stances against them
we need to talk to you
turns to face the earth king theyre here to overthrow you
no were on your side were here to help
you have to trust us
stands up with a rising aggravated tone you invade my palace lay waste to all my guards break down my fancy door and you expect me to trust you
he has a good point
if you are on my side then drop your weapons and stand down
they look at each other for a moment aang drops his staff katara puts her water whip back in her water skin sokka drops his machete and toph drops the boulder she is levitating
smiles see were friends your earthiness gives a slight nervous chuckle
the king says nothing and just continues to frown grimly long feng signals the dai li to cuff their arms with rock gloves
smiles sinisterly detain the assailants
the dai li rush behind team avatar
but we dropped our weapons were your allies
make sure the avatar and his friends never see daylight again the king looks at him shocked
the avatar points at sokka youre the avatar
uh no him nudges his head at aang
effortlessly breaks free of his earth cuffs and raises his arms over here reattaches the cuffs
what does it matter your highness theyre enemies of the state
perhaps youre right sees bosco sniff and lick aang who laughs and smiles at long feng though bosco seems to like him looks back at the team ill hear what he has to say long feng glares at aang
walks forward well sir theres a war going on right now for the past one hundred years in fact the dai lis kept it secret from you its a conspiracy to control the city and to control you
a secret war thats crazy
completely
long feng didnt want us to tell you so he stole our sky bison to blackmail us and blackmail is the least of his crimes he brainwashed our friend
quickly turns to face the king all lies ive never even seen a sky bison your majesty frankly i thought they were extinct
sits down your claim is difficult to believe even from an avatar
whispers in his ear these hooligans are part of an anarchist cell that my agents have been tracking for weeks if you listen to them youre playing right into your own destruction
thinks for a moment i have to trust my advisor
the agents start taking the team away but sokka stops for a moment
wait turns to face the king with a big smile i can prove hes lying long feng said hes never seen a sky bison ask him to lift his robe
what i am not disrobing the king looks thoughtful before looking at sokka suspiciously
aang and sokka smile slyly and nod at each other aang blows a large gust of air at long fengs legs lifting his robe and revealing a bite mark left by appa
right there appa bit him
never met a sky bison huh
lowers his robe that happens to be a large birth mark sarcastically thanks for showing everyone
well i suppose theres no way to prove where those marks came from
of course there is
the group gets appa and brings him in he opens his mouth aang points at the bisons teeth and at long fengs mark
yup that pretty much proves it team avatar cheers but it doesnt prove this crazy conspiracy theory team avatar becomes downcast though i suppose this matters worth looking into team avatar look at each other approvingly while long feng glares at the king before walking away with his agents
back in iroh and zukos apartment zuko is asleep he wakes up
youre burning up dips a cloth in water you have an intense fever places the cloth on zukos forehead this will help cool you down
so thirsty sits up but iroh makes him lie back down
grabs a bucket with a spoon in it takes out the spoon heres some clean water to drink sits him up slightly stay under the blankets and sweat this out
zuko grabs the spoon from iroh and drinks the water he tosses the spoon aside and grabs the bucket he drinks from it while spilling some out he tosses the bucket aside and lies back down iroh pulls the covers more over him meanwhile on a train passengers are shocked to see the earth king who is standing in the middle of the cart surrounded by guards
feeling strange from exposition so this is what a train is like i didnt realize it would be this  public
so youve never been outside the upper ring before
ive never been outside the palace katara and sokka look at each other the earth king looks outside and sees aang flying on appa now thats the way to travel looks at katara and sokka so may i ask where were going
underneath lake laogai your kingliness to the dai lis secret headquarters youre about to see where all the brainwashing and conspiring took place
cut to the shores of lake laogai the team stand on the shore beside the earth king and his guards toph steps to the edge of the water and with a hop reveals the the secret path to the hatch door entrance though discovers it has been destroyed
its gone
oh dont tell me  gives a thumbs up and a fake smile thats okay still got my positive attitude
the dai li mustve known we were coming and destroyed the evidence
looks suspicious hm  sarcastically that seems awfully convenient
hey if anything this proves the conspiracy exists even more
long feng was right this was a waste of time turns to leave if youll excuse me im going back to the palace
smiles with realization the wall theyll never be able to cover that up in time
oh yeah hops to in front of the king if you come with us to the outer wall we can prove to you that the secret war is real
no earth king has ever been to the outer wall walks past aang i dont have any more time for this nonsense aang looks depressed
runs up to them if you come with us this time you can ride on appa the earth king stops as appa lows in the background a pleased smile grows on his face
en route to the outer wall the earth king is riding on appa holding on for dear life and screaming at the top of his lungs in fear his clothes flapping in the wind
first time flying
its both thrilling and terrifying
yeah i hate it too
i have to be honest with you part of me really hopes that what youre telling me about this war isnt true
i wish it wasnt
meanwhile at the apartment iroh again places the moist cloth over his feverish nephews forehead zuko is having a dream that he is the fire lord with no scar on his eye one red and one blue dragon appear and start circling around the pillars on each side of him the blue dragon starts circling around zuko
in azulas voice its getting late are you planning to retire soon my lord
im not tired
into zukos ear relax fire lord zuko just let go give in to it shut your eyes for a while
zuko slowly starts to shut his eyes but widely opens them upon hearing the other dragon
in irohs voice no fire lord zuko do not listen to the blue dragon you should get out of here right now go before its too late both dragons are poised to either side of zuko
sleep now fire lord zuko
the dragons disappear and the room theyre in as well as the guards watching zuko crumble to nothing the blue dragon reappears in front of him two golden eyes appear followed by the face of the blue dragon which closes rapidly
sleep voice grows louder and more hostile as it continues talking just like mother
charges at zuko and opens its mouth inside the dragons mouth zuko sees his mother ursa within that darkness the camera draws closer to ursa who drops her hood
zuko help me a distraught zuko is seen in her eyes
zuko disappears through the floor the sleeping zuko starts sweating meanwhile team avatar arrives at the outer wall and sees the drill
points at the drill its still there
shocked what is that
its a drill a giant drill cut to the drill made by the fire nation to break through your walls cut to a closeup of the king who looks horrified
on top of the wall theyre looking down at the drill
i cant believe i never knew he looks to his right as kuei hears something
appears on an earth elevator with two dai li agents i can explain this your majesty walks toward the king this is nothing more than  a construction project gestures his hand to the drill
sarcastically really then perhaps you could explain why theres a points to the drill as kuei follows to where she is pointing cut to the fire nation insignia clearly shown on the drill fire nation insignia on your construction project
the king looks at him suspiciously well its imported of course you know you cant trust domestic machinery looks at them worried surely you dont believe these children instead of your most loyal attendant
looks at team avatar and long feng dai li arrest long feng i want him to stand trial for crimes against the earth kingdom
long feng and team avatar look shocked the two agents behind long feng share glances launch shackles onto his arms and pull him in
you cant arrest me you all need me more than you know he is taken away
happily looks like long feng is long gone ha ah yeah ive been waiting to use that one katara gives him an unimpressed look
that night at the palace the earth king is talking with team avatar
i want to thank you young heroes for opening my eyes all this time what i thought was a great metropolis was merely a city of fools and that makes me the king fool buries his face in one of his hands were at war with the fire nation
thats why we came to ba sing se your highness because we think you can help us end the war
momo climbs up kueis arm we dont have much time theres a comet coming this summer its energy will give the firebenders unbelievable strength theyll be unstoppable
but there is hope before the comet comes we have a window of opportunity a solar eclipse is coming the sun will be completely blocked out by the moon and the firebenders will be helpless
what are you suggesting sokka
thats the day we need to invade the fire nation cut to a closeup of the king cut back to sokka the day of black sun
i dont know that would require moving troops out of ba sing se wed be completely vulnerable
youre already vulnerable the fire nation wont stop until ba sing se falls you can either sit back and wait for that to happen or take the offensive and give yourself a fighting chance
thinks for a moment as everyone waits anxiously very well you have my support
team avatar celebrates someone else arrives
your majesty walks up to team avatar and bows to the king i apologize for the interruption
to team avatar this is general how hes the leader of the council of five my highest ranking generals
we searched long fengs office i think we found something that will interest everybody team avatar look at each other
in long fengs office a soldier is carrying a box of papers to the desk
there are secret files on everyone in ba sing se including you kids
secret files
takes out a scroll and reads the side toph beifong hands the scroll to general how who hands it to toph who hands it to katara
opens the scroll and reads it its a letter from your mom your moms here in the city and she wants to see you tophs eyes widen with shock
long feng intercepted our letters from home shakes her head thats just sad
takes out another scroll and hands it to aang aang
this scroll was attached to the horn of your bison when the dai li captured it
opens the scroll and reads it its from the eastern air temple
is there a letter for me and sokka by any chance
looks in the box im afraid not
he and katara become downcast oh
but there is an intelligence report that might interest you hands a scroll to katara
opens the scroll and reads it a small fleet of water tribe ships
shocked appears on kataras side what that could be dad
reads the report with excitement protecting the mouth of chameleon bay her and sokkas eyes widen led by hakoda katara and sokka turn to each other in excitement it is dad
meanwhile at the apartment iroh is pouring tea
you should know that this is not a natural sickness but that shouldnt stop you from enjoying tea feeds zuko the tea
whats happening
your critical decision what you did beneath that lake it was in such conflict with your image of yourself that you are now at war within your own mind and body feeds zuko more tea
whats that mean coughs continuously and lies down
you are going through a metamorphosis my nephew it will not be a pleasant experience but when you come out of it takes a cloth and wipes zukos head you will be the beautiful prince you were always meant to be
back in long fengs office
i cant believe it theres a man living at the eastern air temple he says hes a guru
whats a guru some kind of poisonous blow fish
no a spiritual expert he wants to help me take the next step in the avatar journey he says he can teach me to control the avatar state
and i cant believe we know where our dad is now

this is all such big news where do we even start
i hate to say it but we have to split up
worriedly split up we just found appa and got the family back together now you want us to separate
you have to meet this guru aang if were going to invade the fire nation you need to be ready

overjoyed with tears welling in his eyes stands up and dances happily you are the nicest  sister  ever throws his arms around katara and kisses her on the cheek
easy there big brother  gives a slight chuckle though youre right i am
outside the palace team avatar is preparing to leave the king walks down to them katara is petting appa aang turns to face her
katara i need to tell you something starts blushing ive been wanting to say it for a long time
what is it aang
rubs the back of his head katara i he is cut off by sokka
throws aang in a headlock all right whos ready to get going on our little menonly man trip noogies aang katara looks at him annoyed
aang and sokka they look at him i wish you a good journey ba sing se owes you its thanks we look forward to your safe return aang katara and sokka bow
sokka starts climbing atop appa a soldier walks up to the king

hugs toph with aang sokka looks away crossing his arms me too
yeah
everyone goes to hug him aahh great thats enough smiles okay we love each other pats aang and katara on the head seriously
appa flies off back at the apartment iroh and zuko are asleep zuko wakes up and walks into the bathroom he washes his face with water when he looks in the mirror he sees himself with no scar no hair and an arrow tattoo on his head resembling aang he looks horrified he screams himself awake and breathes heavily he touches the scar on his face and closes his eyes meanwhile appa is flying sokka and aang sokka is resting across appas back
you see aang a little positive thinking works wonders we got the king on our side we got long feng arrested and when we get back sukis waiting for me
yeah girls are waiting for us thanks positive attitude
everything is gonna work out perfectly from now on and forever aang turns around and smiles at him
in a prison long feng is sitting in his cell a dai li agent appears outside of the cell
slides a tray of food underneath the door dinner long feng grabs some food the council of five and the military are loyal to the earth king long feng looks at him but the dai li remains loyal to you long feng sir walks away as long feng eats his food while smiling sinisterly
meanwhile at a random house toph is outside she exhales deeply and knocks on the door it opens on its own
enters hello mom anyone home walks to the center of the room she senses something but is quickly captured in a metal box hey who do you think youre dealing with
xin fu the head of a fighting promotion toph was in and master yu tophs former earthbending master appear
one loudmouthed little brat who strayed too far from home
back at the palace three kyoshi warriors are walking up to the king and bow
in our hour of need it is with the highest honor that i welcome our esteemed allies the kyoshi warriors
the warriors look up
we are the earth kings humble servants
the middle warrior is shown to have gold eyes showing that it is really azula mai and ty lee disguised as kyoshi warriors whom they have previously defeated
fade to credits
the episode starts with a view of the exterior of zuko and irohs apartment cut to the interior iroh is preparing food when zuko awakens
whats that smell
its jook im sure you wouldnt like it
sniffs actually it smells delicious id love a bowl uncle holds a bowl up
now that your fever is gone you seem different somehow
optimistically its a new day weve got a new apartment new furniture and todays the grand opening of your new tea shop moves to a table and sits things are looking up uncle irohs shocked expression changes to a smile
aang and sokka fly on appa to a water tribe camp where hakoda is
you havent seen your dad in over two years you must be so excited
almost throwing up i know i should be but i just feel sick to my stomach holds his stomach
dont be nervous hes going to be so happy to see you he puts his hand on sokkas shoulder who smiles
so what about you are you nervous to meet this guru
not at all im ready to master the avatar state ill do whatever it takes sokka gets off appa see you in a week yip yip
aang and appa fly away sokka arrives at the camp where all the warriors greet him warmly
sokka good to see you
he looks and sees the main tent inside hakoda sokkas father is looking at a map with more warriors including bato now with scars on his arm bato nudges hakoda and hakoda becomes happy upon seeing sokka
sokka
hi dad
the two embrace back at the earth kings royal palace the kyoshi warriors azula mai and ty lee in disguise sit before king kuei
look bosco the kyoshi warriors are here to protect us arent you excited bosco yawns its been a difficult week for me my most trusted advisor long feng and his dai li agents tried to take control of ba sing se from me
its terrible when you cant trust the people who are closest to you
pets bosco but there is good news as we speak the council of five is meeting to plan an invasion of the fire nation this summer on the day of a solar eclipse
for a second azulas eyes slightly widen with shock and worry upon hearing this but she quickly hides it
really now that sounds like a fascinating and brilliant plan glances off as mai and ty lee look at each other
cut to the council of five meeting where katara and momo are present
general fongs base will serve as the launching point for the attack in exactly two months the army and navy will invade the fire nation on the day of black sun
momo jumps on the map and begins knocking over the pieces
or we could send in momo to do some damage chuckles cause the  sorry
uses earthbending to stand the pieces back up scaring momo all we need is the earth kings seal in order to execute the plan sends the scroll across the table to katara
ill get these scrolls to him right away thank you general how
aang continues his journey to the eastern air temple he spots guru pathik who is meditating and lands appa
uhhh  hello youre guru pathik right aang approaches pathik the person who attached the note to appas horn
indeed i was a spiritual brother of your people and a personal friend of monk gyatso
in your note aang sits you said you could teach me how to gain control of the avatar state how
you must gain balance within yourself before you can bring balance to the world and the first step to gaining balance begins with this hands aang a yellow beverage in a wooden cup drink up
takes it and looks at it drinks it and quickly spits it out to his left in disgust uggh it tastes like onion and banana juice
thats because it is pathik empties another bowl and holds it over his head yum yum
aang blinks in disbelief meanwhile xin fu and master yu are working to bring toph back to the beifong estate
i believe we need to go right
what are you talking about the beifong estates this way
im quite certain youre mistaken
banging at the cell hey can you two old ladies quit your bickering for a second i got to go to the bathroom
oooh  uhhh okay but make it quick getting up with a key in hand
stopping yu whats wrong with you
ooh very sneaky toph nice try but you cant trick me sits down
let me out of here so i can kick both your butts
quit your banging bangs the metal box you might think youre the greatest earthbender in the world but even you cant bend metal
toph looks sad as she places her hand on a side of the metal box the scene cuts to that night and where azula mai and ty lee are staying which is a small building in the upper ring mai and ty lee are removing their makeup a smiling ty lee is looking in a mirror she is wiping the last traces of her kyoshi makeup from her face mai is seated next to ty lee still working on her own face
we have been presented with an extraordinary opportunity girls
mai finally gets to wear makeup thats not totally depressing azula walks past toward a window
with large dark splotches of black makeup dripping down her eyes sarcastically ha ha
im talking about conquering the whole earth kingdom the two girls turn with shocked looks for one hundred years the fire nation has hammered away at ba sing se from the outside but now were on the inside and we can take it by ourselves
admiringly gosh youre so confident i really admire that about you
from the inside were in perfect position to organize a coup and overthrow the earth king the key is the dai li whoever controls the dai li turns back into the room controls ba sing se
back to the eastern air temple at a creek
in order to master the avatar state you must open all the chakras aang tell me everything you know about chakras
rubs eyes what are chakras
oh i see i guess well start with the basics as he explains he points to the water and the moss within the water flows through this creek much like the energy flows through your body as you see there are several pools where the water swirls around before flowing on these pools are like our chakras
so chakras are pools of spiraling energy in our bodies
exactly if nothing else were around this creek would flow pure and clear however life is messy and things tend to fall in the creek and then what happens
the creek cant flow
yes but if we open the ponds between the pools  he removes moss blocking the exit for the water
the energy flows
in another part of the temple a cavern
there are seven chakras that go up the body each pool of energy has a purpose and can be blocked by a specific kind of emotional muck be warned opening the chakras is an intense experience and once you begin the process you cannot stop until all seven are open are you ready
momentarily looks down ill do whatever it takes
first we will open the earth chakra located at the base of the spine it deals with survival and is blocked by fear what are you most afraid of let your fears become clear to you
aang sees images of things that cause him great fear including the blue spirit attacking him general fong sinking katara into the ground himself merging with la at the north pole fire lord ozai and sozins comet which make him scream
aang your vision is not real you are concerned for your survival but you must surrender those fears let your fears flow down the creek aang clears the image away you have opened your earth chakra aang wipes sweat off his forehead
later behind a waterfall
next is the 
water chakra
brilliant maybe one day you will be a guru too this chakra deals with pleasure and is blocked by guilt now look at all the guilt with burdens you so what do you blame yourself for
sees the image of him leaving home i ran away sees images of him in the avatar state at general fongs base i hurt all of those people
accept the reality that these things happened but do not let them cloud and poison your energy if you are to be a positive influence on the world you need to forgive yourself
scene cuts to the next day at the water tribe camp
this bay leads directly to the outskirts of ba sing se weve been using these tangle mines to stop the fire nation ships from getting through
filling the mine with skunk fish and seaweed before moving away your father invented tangle mines himself
destructive buoyant and  sniffs and immediately becomes disgusted aggh ehhh terrible smelling
very perceptive the mines are filled with skunk fish and seaweed when a ship detonates the mine the seaweed tangles up the propeller and the foul smell forces people to abandon the ship i call it the stink and sink
laughs good one dad
nearby unamused youre definitely your fathers son
approaching hakoda our scouts have spotted four fire nation ships
bato get these mines loaded up the rest of you men prepare for battle
the warriors run off to prepare as sokka looks around before looking back to his father
uhhh  what should i do dad
arent you listening i said the rest of you men get ready for battle
sokka smiles and departs back in ba sing se at the jasmine dragon zuko and iroh observe the happenings standing at the back
who thought when we came to this city as refugees that id end up owning my own tea shop follow your passion zuko and life will reward you
congratulations uncle
i am very thankful
you deserve it the jasmine dragon will be the best tea shop in the city
no im thankful because you decided to share this special day with me it means more than you know the two embrace
now lets make these people some tea walks away to the back
yes lets make some tea
back to the eastern air temple aang and pathik sit on a ledge
third is the fire chakra located in the stomach
holding his stomach my fire chakra would like to eat something other than onionbanana juice
chuckles good one moving on this chakra deals with willpower and is blocked by shame what are you ashamed of cuts to aangs vision of his first attempt at firebending which resulted in him accidentally burning kataras hands what are your biggest disappointments in yourself
im never going to firebend again i cant
you will never find balance if you deny this part of your life you are the avatar and therefore you are a firebender aang breathes deeply hmmm  that chakra opened less like a flowing creek and more like a  burping bison
loud belch tastes like onions and bananas but strangely something else pickles pathik shrugs
back at the palace two dai li agents hide on two pillars and secretly spy on a conversation between mai and ty lee the former is sitting on the stairs and the latter is practicing chi blocking and acrobatics
sighs im tired of wearing this girly disguise i dont know how anyone could fight in this
maybe thats why it was so easy to beat the kyoshi warriors and take their clothes
how much longer do we have to serve the earth king if i have to clean up one more pile of bear poop im going to throw up
princess azula promised we would go back to the fire nation as soon as we captured the avatar we just have to be patient
stands up shush up do you want the whole palace to know were fire nation
sorry
the agents smile and climb away azula who was hiding behind another pillar walks up to them
good work girls im sure the dai li will deliver the message
back at the air temple
the fourth chakra is located in the heart it deals with love and is blocked by grief aang smiles and looks at a air nomad statue nearby before looking sad lay all your grief out in front of you
aang sees images of many airbenders including gyatso and yangchen he smiles upon seeing them but becomes saddened as they start to vanish into smoke
you have indeed felt a great loss the airbenders appear floating in the clouds but love is a form of energy and it swirls all around us aang is lifted into the air and sees the air nomads floating in the smoke the air nomads love for you has not left this world it is still inside of your heart and is reborn in the form of new love
the smoke in front of aang forms a face and shows the first thing he saw upon waking up from his iceberg katara back in the real world aang is starting to cry tears of joy
let the pain flow away aang wipes away his tears very good
can i have some onionbanana juice please
inside another part of the temple
the fifth in the chain is the sound chakra located in the throat it deals with truth and is blocked by lies the ones we tell ourselves
aang flashes back to when he katara and sokka first began their journey to the north pole
why didnt you tell us you were the avatar
back to the real world aang finds himself answering the question
because i never wanted to be
you cannot lie about your own nature you must accept that you are the avatar aang inhales and seeing an image of himself on a cliff looking down at the ground exhales and accepts his nature very good aang you have opened the chakra of truth
outside the temple interior
the sixth pool of energy is the light chakra located in the center of the forehead it deals with insight and is blocked by illusion the greatest illusion of this world is the illusion of separation things you think are separate and different are actually one in the same
an image is shown of the world with the four nations territories marked like the four nations
the image changes so the territories become the same color yes we are all one people the territories become separate again but we live as if divided
were all connected everything is connected
thats right even the separation of the four elements is an illusion if you open your mind you will see that all the elements are one four parts of the same whole even metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined
as pathik speaks the camera fades to xin fu and yu trying to take toph home she feels around the metal cage with seismic sense and feels tiny particles of earth in the metal she smiles exhales deeply and begins to push against the metal
struggling come on metal budge she punches a hole in the metal and shakes her hand in pain wooo toph you rule
she takes another punch as we cut back to ba sing se katara walks by the jasmine dragon
what do you say momo a cup of tea before we get back to the king arrives at the shop table for two please
uncle i need two jasmine one green and one lychee
im brewing as fast as i can
katara notices zuko and iroh stunned she runs away from the shop
the scene returns to aang and pathik who sit at the top of the temple at night
this is the last chakra isnt it
yes once you open this chakra you will be able to go in and out of the avatar state at will and when you are in the avatar state you will have complete control and awareness of all your actions
lets do this
the thought chakra is located at the crown of the head it deals with pure cosmic energy and is blocked by earthly attachment meditate on what attaches you to this world images of katara appear before aang now let all of those attachments go let them flow down the river forgotten
coming out of his meditation what why would i let go of katara i  i love her
learn to let her go or you cannot let the pure cosmic energy flow in from the universe
why would i choose cosmic energy over katara aang throws his hands up how could it be a bad thing that i feel an attachment to her three chakras ago that was a good thing
you must learn to let go
back at the palace katara runs to inform the earth king only to encounter the kyoshi warriors
thank goodness youre here suki something terrible is going on the fire nation has infiltrated the city i just saw prince zuko and his uncle azula widens her eyes in surprise and smiles slyly we have to tell the earth king right away
oh dont worry ill be sure to let him know
katara notices suki has gold eyes and is shocked upon realization that the kyoshi warriors are actually azula mai and ty lee she prepares to attack but ty lee quickly jumps forward and blocks her chi
while the three girls gather around the fallen katara pans to camera looking up to the three girls so zuzus in the city too i think its time for a family reunion momo flies off
back at the temple
im sorry but i cant let go of katara
aang to master the avatar state you must open all the chakras surrender yourself
okay ill try
now think of your attachments and let them go let the pure cosmic energy flow
aang sees an image of him letting katara go and a bridge that will lead him to avatar state mastery as he is being surrounded by energy however he hears a shriek from katara and sees a vision of her in chains he runs away from the end of the road this cuts his connection to the avatar state which drops him back to reality
kataras in danger i have to go prepares to exit
no aang by choosing attachment you have locked the chakra if you leave now you wont be able to go into the avatar state at all
aang hesitates but leaves anyway leaving pathik concerned meanwhile the journey to take toph back to her home is stopped when xin fu and yu hear a loud noise they go to investigate and notice a hole in the cage and that toph is gone
its another one her tricks
theres a giant hole in the box how is that a trick
from behind them its not its the real deal
she earthbends the two men together throws them in the cage and metalbends the cage shut
jumps on top of the box i am the greatest earthbender in the world dont you two dunderheads ever forget it stomps on the box and exits using earth surfing
inside the box im going to be stuck in here forever with you arent i
i have to go the bathroom xin fu groans and slams his head against the box
back at the water tribe camp hakoda approaches sokka
ready to go knock some fire nation heads
you dont know how much this means to me dad ill make you proud and ill finally prove to you what a great warrior i am
placing his hand on sokkas shoulder sokka you dont have to prove anything to me im already proud of you and ive always known youre a great warrior
really
why do you think i trusted you to look after our tribe when i left
just as the two are boarding the ship aang and appa appear aang shows a clear look of concern
this cant be good news
aang and sokka depart just as theyre leaving sokka looks back at hakoda who looks back and grins back in ba sing se azula is led into a prison by two dai li agents she is taken to long fengs cell
what is this about your agents show up in the middle of the night and drag me down here you will not treat a kyoshi warrior this way
but youre not a kyoshi warrior are you standing princess azula of the fire nation
what do you want
i want to make a deal its time that i regain control of ba sing se and you have something i need
oh
the earth kings trust
why should i help you
because i can get you the avatar
smirks im listening 
long feng smiles back at the jasmine dragon a royal messenger enters
a message from the royal palace
reads through becomes shocked and smiles i  i cant believe it
what is it uncle
excited great news weve been invited to serve tea to the earth king runs off
zuko smiles as he continues sweeping back in the prison hold the door to long fengs cell is closed azula leaves long fengs presence and gives a smirk fade to credits
ostrich horses are drinking water from a river as appa aang and sokka fly over them
so what kind of trouble is katara in
i dont know in my vision i just knew she needed help
it would be nice if your avatar powers could be just a little more specific from time to time he looks down and notices a mound of earth passing nearby heading to the wall what is that
they fly down and follow the mound toph is seen still earth surfing aang and sokka come down beside her
need a ride
toph becomes startled at the sound of sokkas voice and falls backward off of the mound sokka and aang cringe upon seeing her fall scene changes to azula speaking to the dai li
while pacing back and forth the earth king and the council of five do not trust the dai li they imprisoned your leader long feng soon they will turn on all of you and eliminate you seizing power today is a matter of life and death as she talks an agent with a mustache starts looking nervous and slightly lowers his head this coup must be swift and decisive the earth king and each of the five generals must be taken out simultaneously long feng has placed you in my command while we overthrow the government walks over to her left to another agent with a tiny vertical scar on his right cheek when she nears him she stares sideways at the agent while still addressing all the agents if i sense any disloyalty any hesitation any weakness at all she stops right in front of the scarred agent i will snuff it out she continues walking with the eyes of the now nervous scarred agent following her that is all
the dai li leave and azula walks up to ty lee who is pouring tea
nice speech azula it was pretty and poetic but also scary in a good way she hands the cup to azula camera pans over to a closeup of mai
amused yeah i thought you were going to make that one guy pee his pants
there are still a few loose ends the avatar and my brother and uncle
scene fades to outside the royal palace where zuko and iroh begin walking toward it
many times i imagined myself here at the threshold of the palace camera pans to show the earth kingdom emblem above the palace doors but i always thought i would be here as a conqueror instead we are the earth kings personal guests here to serve him tea destiny is a funny thing
it sure is uncle
scene changes back to appa toph aang and sokka still flying back to the palace toph is seen holding onto sokkas arm so she does not fall
so how did it go with the guru did you master the avatar state
uh 
aang looks down and thinks back to what guru pathik said before he left
if you leave now you wont be able to go into the avatar state at all
fades back to the present
aang are you okay
im great it went great with the guru i completely mastered the avatar state he laughs nervously and looks down yeah
scene changes back to the royal palace where zuko and iroh are sitting at a table in a room waiting for the earth king iroh pours some tea into a cup
whats taking so long
maybe the earth king overslept
dai li agents begin to circle around the two
somethings not right
azula walks past the dai li and comes in front of her brother outside the circle of dai li agents
its tea time
he quickly stands up azula
have you met the dai li theyre earthbenders but they have a killer instinct thats so firebender i just love it
camera pans over to show iroh picking up his cup of tea
did i ever tell you how i got the nickname the dragon of the west
im not interested in a lengthy anecdote uncle
its more of a demonstration really
iroh begins drinking his tea zuko looks over at him and smiles before going behind him iroh begins breathing fire cut to a corridor outside the room as a fire blast makes a hole in the wall allowing iroh and zuko to escape the dai li agents begin shooting some rock gloves at them but miss as zuko and iroh turn around the corner iroh generates lightning and destroys the wall in front before jumping down into a bush below zuko stops at the edge
come on youll be fine
no im tired of running its time i faced azula
zuko turns around and walks back iroh smacks his head upon hearing this and runs away
youre so dramatic what are you going to challenge me to an agni kai
yes i challenge you
no thanks
zuko shoots a fire blast toward her but two dai li agents intervene and pull up a section of the floor making a wall they shoot some rock gloves at zukos feet making him lose his balance he puts his right hand down but another rock glove traps that one azula turns around smiling and walks away as the agents capture him scene changes to inside the throne room where sokka toph and aang confront kuei
kataras fine you have nothing to worry about
but in my vision i felt so sure she was in trouble
well she met with the council of generals to plan the invasion and since then she been off with your friends the kyoshi warriors
see aang shes with suki theyre probably back at our apartment right now talking about makeup or something
okay maybe youre right
believe me if there was any danger at all boscos animal instincts would sense it
bosco lifts up his head from sleeping to look at the three scene changes to inside the crystal catacombs where katara is pacing back and forth she stops pacing upon hearing a hole open up above
youve got company
he throws zuko in who rolls down and lands in front of katara
zuko
kataras shocked face becomes an angry one as zuko sits up and the hole closes behind him the scene changes to toph aang and sokka reaching their house on appa the three jump off and run inside to see if katara was in there momo runs up to them
momo
momo climbs up aang onto his shoulders toph looks around
theres no one else here
katara is in trouble i knew it
oh no
wait someones at the door someone knocks on the door a second later actually i know who it is its an old friend of mine she walks over to the door and opens it showing iroh behind the door glad to see youre okay
i need your help
sokka and aang become shocked and angry upon seeing him and get into a fighting stance toph calmly smiles and waves at him momo flies away upon seeing him
you guys know each other
i met him in the woods once and knocked him down then he gave me some tea and some very good advice
may i come in toph nods and he walks in before turning to the group princess azula is here in ba sing se
she must have katara
she has captured my nephew as well
then well work together to fight azula and save katara and zuko
approaching aang and pointing at him whoa there you lost me at zuko
i know how you must feel about my nephew moving forward to place his hands on sokkas shoulders but believe me when i tell you that there is good inside him
pushing iroh away good inside him isnt enough why dont you come back when its outside him too okay
kataras in trouble all of ba sing se is in trouble working together is our best chance
sokka understands and nods iroh begins walking back to the door
i brought someone along who might help us
they all walk outside toph puts a couple earth pillars around the nervous dai li agent and makes him stand up iroh walks over to him and takes the gag off his mouth revealing this to be the scarred agent
azula and long feng are plotting a coup theyre going to overthrow the earth king
my sister where are they keeping katara
in the crystal catacombs of old ba sing se deep beneath the palace
iroh aang toph and sokka run away to help katara and the earth king scene fades to the jail where long feng is he meditates in his cell while a dai li agent informs him of what is going on
the movements of the earth king and all the generals have been plotted out stepbystep
good and the fire nation princess is cooperating
oh yes more than cooperating shes really taken charge shes terrifying and inspirational at the same time its hard to explain
the dai li agent walks away scene changes to inside the crystal catacombs where katara is yelling at zuko who sits with his back turned
why did they throw you in here zuko says nothing oh wait let me guess its a trap so that when aang shows up to help me you can finally have him in your little fire nation clutches
zuko turns his head to look at her turns back and looks at the ground again
continuing to lament youre a terrible person you know that always following us hunting the avatar trying to capture the worlds last hope for peace but what do you care youre the fire lords son spreading war and violence and hatred is in your blood
you dont know what youre talking about
angrily i dont how dare you you have no idea what this war has put me through sits down me personally she sits down and touches her necklace begins to cry the fire nation took my mother away from me
he turns around to face katara im sorry pauses thats something we have in common
katara looks back surprised and wipes away the tears from her eyes the scene changes to toph feeling the ground below finding the crystal catacombs
well whatd you know there is an ancient city down there but its deep
she makes a tunnel through the ground beginning to lead to the catacombs sokka is seen thinking of a plan
we should split up aang you go with iroh to look for katara and the angry jerk remembers iroh is there and places his left hand on irohs right shoulder no offense
shrugging none taken
and ill go with toph to warn the earth king of azulas coup
aang and iroh are seen walking through the tunnel down to the catacombs iroh is bending a small fire for light and aang is earthbending the way down
so toph thinks you give pretty good advice and great tea
the key to both is proper aging whats on your mind
aang earthbends again before replying
well i met with this guru who was supposed to help me master the avatar state and control this great power but to do it i had to let go of someone i love he and iroh stop and i just couldnt
perfection and power are overrated i think you were very wise to choose happiness and love
earthbends again what happens if we cant save anyone and beat azula without the avatar state what if im not powerful enough
i dont know the answer sometimes life is like this dark tunnel you cant always see the light at the end of the tunnel but if you just keep moving aang earthbends the rocks away one last time irohs fire blows out he smiles you will come to a better place
camera pans over a large area of the catacombs scene changes to toph and sokka climbing the stairs with momo flying behind them
theres general how
sokka puts his arm out in front of toph and pulls her behind a pillar general how continues walking toward the stairs the dai li agents can be seen hiding beside the pillars before putting cuffs on his wrists and pulling him down to his knees another agent drops in front of how
whats going on here
youre under house arrest
the coup is happening right now weve gotta warn the earth king
sokka toph and momo run to head to the earth king one of the generals is seen walking when some chains fly up and trap him general sung is taken by some chains into a dark area two other generals are seen in their headquarters when the dai li toss some chains to circle around their legs and pull them up scene changes to the throne room where toph sokka and momo have just reached the earth king
thank goodness were in time
in time for what
yeah what are you in time for cartwheels to sokka cutie
uh im kinda involved with suki
who
toph knocks her away from sokka with earthbending in which she flips up above them
theyre not the real kyoshi warriors
kuei gasps surprised
sorry to disappoint you
she shoots some of her daggers at toph who uses an earth shield to stop them and kicks the shield to mai who jumps over it toph brings up another pillar knocking her ty lee comes up in front of sokka laughing she starts trying to jab him but he evades all of them
oooh its like were dancing together
azula is seen holding kuei at flamepoint
this fight is over
toph and sokka surrender and ty lee chi blocks them momo tries flying away but a dai li agent traps him with a rock glove azula shoves kuei down
get them all out of my sight
toph sokka kuei and bosco are all taken to prison long feng walks into the room with some dai li agents behind him
now comes the part where i double cross you dai li arrest the fire nation princess none of the dai li agents move to long fengs disappointment i said arrest her what is wrong with you
its because they havent made up their minds theyre waiting to see how this is going to end
what are you talking about
i can see your whole history in your eyes you were born with nothing so youve had to struggle and connive and claw your way to power but true power the divine right to rule is something youre born with the fact is they dont know which one of us is going to be sitting on that throne and which one is going to be bowing down long feng looks worried but i know and you know she sits down on the throne and crosses her legs well
walks up and bows to her youve beaten me at my own game
dont flatter yourself you were never even a player
the scene changes to zuko and katara in the crystal catacombs
apologetic im sorry i yelled at you before
it doesnt matter
its just that for so long now whenever i would imagine the face of the enemy it was your face
my face i see he touches his scar
no no thatsthats not what i mean approaches zuko
its okay i used to think this scar marked me the mark of the banished prince cursed to chase the avatar forever but lately ive realized im free to determine my own destiny even if ill never be free of my mark
maybe you could be free of it
what
i have healing abilities
its a scar it cant be healed
holds up a vial this is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole it has special properties so ive been saving it for something important moves in front of zuko i dont know if it would work but 
katara puts one hand on zukos scar only to be interrupted by aang and iroh
aang
aang looks surprised as katara hugs him but aang looks over kataras shoulder to glare at zuko cut to zuko who gets a hug from iroh and glares back
aang i knew you would come she hugs aang again
uncle i dont understand what are you doing with the avatar points to aang
saving you thats what
zuko takes one step in aangs direction but iroh stops him
zuko its time we talked to aang and katara go help you other friends well catch up with you they walk away katara looks back at zuko before moving on
why uncle
youre not the man you used to be zuko you are stronger and wiser and freer than you have ever been and now you have come to the crossroads of your destiny its time for you to choose its time for you to choose good
zuko yells as crystals grow to encase iroh he assumes a fighting position to prepare for the intruders a different shot shows azula along with two dai li agents sliding down from the sides of the chamber
i expected this kind of treachery from uncle cut to iroh still trapped in crystals cut to a side shot where zuko protects his uncle but zuko prince zuko youre a lot of things but youre not a traitor are you
release him immediately
its not too late for you zuko you can still redeem yourself
to zuko the kind of redemption she offers is not for you
why dont you let him decide uncle to zuko i need you zuko ive plotted every move of this day makes a fist this glorious day in fire nation history and the only way we win is together at the end of this day you will have your honor back you will have fathers love you will have everything you want
zuko i am begging you look into your heart and see what it is that you truly want
you are free to choose
she gestures at the two dai li agents to leave who earthbend themselves out the camera cuts to zuko multiple times as he contemplates his choice as azula leaves to follow aang and katara cut to aang and katara running through the crystal catacombs
weve got to find sokka and toph
a bolt of blue lightning attacks them from behind aang stops it using earthbending the camera zooms back toward azula the source of the lightning katara uses waterbending to stop another lightning attack the mist from the vaporized water allows azula to jump onto a crystal and firebend two blasts of blue fire together aang and katara use waterbending to stop the blasts azula finishes her jump by landing on a rock pillar aang uses earthbending on the pillar and azula gasps once she notices the pillar crumbling she jumps off and lands between katara and aang she points at both of them preparing to attack
a fire blast stops her from attacking and they look to see the source of the fire blast to be zuko zuko looks from azula to katara and aang choosing who to attack aang gasps once he realizes zuko will attack him and aang uses airbending to jump away from the blast azula starts dueling with katara and zuko throws multiple fire blasts at aang the scene changes to kuei sokka and toph in a prison cell sokka looks out the doors barred window
see any dai li agents nearby
nope all clear
toph cracks her knuckles and places her hands against the cell door preparing to metalbend it cut to outside the prison cell in the where the door crumples and gets thrown away from the doorway
lets go
im not leaving without bosco
sokka grabs the earth kings hand and follows the rest of the group cut back to zuko and aang fighting aang airbends the air currents around him to make a humanshaped gust of air at zuko knocking him down aang attacks zuko with more airbending but zuko maneuvers around the attacks and gets back up on his feet he fires more blasts at aang who is clinging on to a rock pillar aang jumps onto a clump of crystals to avoid the attack furious zuko summons a greater blast of fire aang earthbends some crystals to protect him but the crystals shatter sending aang flying to another clump of crystals zuko uses fire whips to attack aang once again but aang jumps to another patch of crystals and zuko keeps attacking
cut to azula running away from katara who sends a wave of water that cuts her hair cut back to zuko who is still using his fire whips to attack aang who is now jumping along the caves ceiling aang kicks down a stalactite and follows it using earthbending to increase its impact and sending zuko flying the scene focuses on azula and katara katara encases herself in water and uses it to stop azulas firebending attacks one water tentacle captures azulas hand and another one captures her foot zuko frees his sister using firebending to break the tentacles azula looks toward the crater aang had created with the stalactite aang crawls out exhausted azula runs toward aang cut to zuko and katara fighting katara still has water whips on her hands and zuko starts using his fire whips
i thought you had changed she grunts
i have changed
zuko fires another blast cut to azula and aang standing opposite each other a closer shot of azula and aang as they prepare to fight azula uses firebending to charge at aang aang earthbends crystals around him into a crystal encased armor and charges at azula azula stops and uses her firebending to break aangs crystal armor and send him flying back into an old building cut to mai ty lee and bosco in the earth kings throne room
to bosco come on its easy you just walk on your front paws instead of your rear ones she demonstrates like this
suddenly the floor traps ty lees hands and her feet when they touch the ground bosco starts clapping the view changes to reveal kuei toph and sokka
that is a nice trick
sokka takes out his boomerang and toph earthbends a large block of the ground in preparation to fight against mai the camera zooms toward mai
just take the bear
cut to bosco
runs to bosco bosco
the scene changes back to zuko and azula both fighting katara hopelessly outnumbered katara gets knocked down aang jumps from the old building and earth surfs toward zuko and azula to stop them from attacking katara a dai li agent breaks aangs surf knocking him down more dai li agents gather behind zuko and azula katara starts regaining her focus and dai li agents surround her katara uses the octopus form to defend herself aang stands up and surveys the scene
theres too many he looks a katara
from aangs memory the only way is to let her go
im sorry katara
closing his eyes he turns away from azula and zuko and earthbends a crystal shelter tent aang starts meditating inside aangs mind a giant version of himself in the avatar state the avatar spirit holds an airbending sphere with a normalsized version of himself in the avatar state back in the crystal shelter aang enters the avatar state and the crystal shelter starts glowing alerting those outside inside the shelter aang opens his glowing eyes and breaks the crystal above him the camera shows katara looking up to aang now rising in to the air with hope but before aang can let katara go and control the avatar state a bolt of lightning strikes him in the back cut to azulas eyeball watching aang getting struck before it zooms out to show her in a lightning summoning position with her fingers smoking the avatar spirit lets go of aang and falls out of the plane of existence as aang falls down katara tears now falling down her face creates a wave to catch aang the wave knocks down the dai li agents she looks down at aang and back up with tears in her eyes zuko and azula prepare to attack aang and katara but a blast of fire stops them iroh jumps down from the wall of the cave and shields aang and katara from zuko and azula
youve got to get out of here ill hold them off as long as i can fires some blasts at zuko and azula
katara walks away slowly with aangs body to a waterfall and she uses waterbending to lift her and aang up its path iroh holds off the dai li agents until after aang and katara leave he submits to the dai li who use earthbending to encase him in crystals zuko looks at iroh and iroh closes his eyes and turns away cut to bosco kuei toph sokka aang and katara riding on appa appa moans sadly cut to a closer shot of katara placing aangs body on appa katara opens the vial around her neck and uses water healing on aangs wounded back the glowing from the spirit water stops and katara starts crying aangs tattoos glow for a second and aang gasps katara looks at aang who smiles a little and she holds him closer cut to the earth kings throne room with azula sitting down at the throne with zuko at her left
weve done it zuko its taken a hundred years but the fire nation has conquered ba sing se

no he betrayed you she stands up from the throne zuko when you return home father will welcome you as a war hero
but i dont have the avatar what if father doesnt restore my honor
he doesnt need to zuko she puts a hand on zukos shoulder today you restored your own honor
zuko looks turns away uncertain of himself cut to an aerial view of ba sing se cut to appas passengers
the earth kingdom  has fallen
the camera pans down to show katara who sits next to an unconscious aang and looks up appa flies over the walls of ba sing se fade to credits
the episode opens on board a fire nation ship where aang finally regains consciousness the camera zooms out on his face as he opens his eyes and rises from his bed visibly shaken and in pain
what happened sees the fire nation designs and flag and immediately assumes he has been captured oh no
he leaves his room carefully creaking open the door and peering outside for any sign of fire nation soldiers using his glider as a crutch aang stumbles across the hall occasionally leaning on the wall for support due to being weak he stops at a turn in the hallway upon hearing two guards who are actually pipsqueak and the duke talking to each other
you hear something aang retreats behind the wall where he dons a determined look and quickly steps out to send a weak air blast at them which only ruffles their clothes and moves past the hallway hes awake the two begin chasing aang who struggles to escape stop wait
aang manages to reach the deck of the ship however he stumbles on the stairway and drops his staff it slides over to where hakoda and bato disguised as fire nation soldiers are petting momo
confused momo
momo runs toward aang jumps on his shoulder and licks his face toph and katara standing near the edge of the ship hear the events
twinkle toes thats got to be you

sokka breathes heavily appears to be passing out
uhoh somebody catch him hes going to
the screen becomes black as aang collapses to the floor katara running short of catching him the shot cuts to the entire group including appa surrounding aang who is now in kataras arms meanwhile on another ship zuko is heading toward the fire nation mai joins him

the two kiss mai exits and zuko stays there with an expression of relief on his face we return to the ship where team avatar is on aang is awake once again he sits in front of katara also sitting surrounded by toph and sokka appa rests behind them aang receives a robe to cover him
why are we on a fire nation ship why is everyone dressed this way and why am i the only one whos completely out of it katara and aang are left alone

confused look what not at all why would you say that
aang shrugs and murmurs as if to say i dont know but gasps in pain
maybe we should go upstairs helping aang up you need a healing session
back in aangs room on the ship katara bends some water onto the scar left by azulas lightning attack
tell me where the pain feels most intense
mmm a little higher uhhh
aang briefly flashes to the battle where he rises into the avatar state
wow youre definitely in the right area there
i can feel a lot of energy twisted up around there begins to remove the water let me just see if i can
aang again flashes back to the battle to the moment where he was attacked before moving on to the scene where katara is looking over him crying after that he snaps back to reality
i went down i didnt just get hurt did i it was worse than that i was gone but you brought me back
i just used the spirit water from the north pole i dont know what i did exactly
turning to look at her you saved me
placing a hand on the side of his face you need to rest
the scene switches to the fire nation capital li and lo addressing a crowd below
your princess azula clever and beautiful disguised herself as the enemy and entered the earth kingdoms capital in ba sing se she found her brother zuko and together they faced the avatar 
and the avatar fell and the earth kingdom fell
azulas agents quickly overtook the entire city they went to ba sing ses great walls 
and brought them down
the armies of the fire nation surged through the walls and swarmed over ba sing se securing our victory
a flashback shows the dai li taking down ba sing ses walls and the fire nation troops entering the city as earth kingdom citizens look on with fear tanks are seen approaching the ba sing ses royal palace before flashing back to li and lo with azula approaching between them
now the heroes have returned home
your princess azula  crowd cheers
and after three long years your prince has returned 
zuko
zuko approaches with a worried expression crowd cheers we now go back to team avatars ship sokka sits on a crate with a map with the others surrounding him as he narrates past events
after what happened at ba sing se we had to get you to safety we flew back to chameleon bay where we found my father and the other water tribe men flashback preparing to leave by taking off his earth king robes revealing traveling robes beneath the earth king decided he wanted to travel the world in disguise so he set off alone bosco is shown taking off his own attire and hat before kuei jumps on bosco and they set off well not completely alone cut back to sokka continuing the story soon the bay was overrun by fire nation ships rather than fight them all we captured a single ship and made it our disguise since then weve been traveling west we crossed through the serpents pass a few days ago weve seen a few fire nation ships but none have bothered us
so what now
weve been working on a modified version of the invasion plan
its sokkas invasion plan
yes sokkas plan we wont be able to mount a massive invasion without the earth kings armies but the solar eclipse will still leave the fire nation vulnerable
so were planning a smaller invasion just a ragtag team of our friends and allies from around the earth kingdom we already ran into pipsqueak and the duke
eating noodles with the duke on his shoulder good to see you again aang
and the best part is the eclipse isnt even our biggest advantage whispers we have a secret  you
me
yep the whole world thinks youre dead isnt that great
aang is shocked cut to aang looking out to the water from a side of the boat
the world thinks im dead how is that good news thats terrible
approaching aang no its great it means the fire nation wont be hunting us anymore and even better they wont be expecting you on the day of black sun
no no no no no you have no idea this is so messed up
another fire nation ship approaches
ill handle this the avatar is back opens glider and grunts in pain
approaching aang aang wait remember they dont know were not fire nation
sweating aang puts his glider away
everyone just stay calm he and bato put their helmets on bato and i will take care of this
pipsqueak and the duke cover appa and momo while aang toph sokka and katara hide in a square hole
i hate not being able to do anything
hopefully you wont need to
crew from the other ship boards team avatars ship
commander why are you off course all western fleet ships are supposed to be moving toward ba sing se to support the occupation
actually were from the eastern fleet we have orders to deliver some cargo
ahhh  eastern fleet well nice of admiral chan to let us know he was sending one of his ships our way
im sure admiral chan meant no disrespect sir
i mean how hard is it to write a quick note and send a hawk our way
next time well send bato and hakoda glance at each other two hawks to make sure you get the message
the two bow to each other and hakoda and bato exit
sir  admiral chan has been on leave for two months at ember island
what why doesnt anyone ever tell me anything somethings not right they should have known that i think this is a captured ship whispering just stay quiet until were safely across the ramp then well sink this ship
toph hearing this emerges
they know
she metalbends the bridge between the ships off the captain and his guards fall into the water katara creates a large wave which separates the other ship from theirs team avatars ship departs quickly the captain and his guards from the other ship climbs back on board theirs by rope ladder meanwhile back at the fire nation capital zuko feeds turtle ducks in a lake with some bread azula joins him
you seem so downcast has mai gotten to you already though actually mai has been in a strangely good mood lately
i havent seen dad yet i havent seen him in three years since i was banished
so what
so i didnt capture the avatar
who cares the avatar is dead  zuko looks away unless you think he somehow miraculously survived
zuko flashes back to when katara explained about her vial of spirit water
during flashback this is water from the spirit oasis at the north pole it has special properties so ive been saving it for something important
back to the present
no theres no way he could have survived they glare at each other
well then im sure you have nothing to worry about
back at the ocean the second ship begins firing at team avatars toph takes an earthbending stance while the duke stands behind her to guide her
load the toph
pipsqueak drops a boulder in front of toph who begins earthbending it at the attacking ship it hits a catapult as another fires others try to fight back with a series of rocks that toph earthbends at the other ship with the dukes guidance toph earthbends another piece of rock and sends it to intercept the oncoming fireball aang inside the ship with sokka makes a move to help but is stopped by sokka in frustration he bangs his head against his staff the other ship fires a harpoon piercing a hole in team avatars ships bottom as water flows in katara noticing this freezes the water below to plug the hole
im gonna give us some cover
she brings up vapor from the water to create a fog screen however a fireball makes its way through and destroys the rocks that toph had being used
cut back to aang and sokka in the ship
i just cant stand by and do nothing runs out
following aang no grabs the staff youre still hurt and you have to stay secret just let us handle this
fine grabs his staff and walks away
two fireballs hit the ship causing a fire katara quickly extinguishes it with waterbending
how are we doing
things couldnt get much worse a serpent rises from the water near their ship the universe just loves proving me wrong doesnt it
you make it too easy
the serpent is hit by a fireball from the other ship in anger it wraps itself around the other ship allowing team avatars ship to escape
thank you the universe
team avatars ship arrives a port in a town aang is alone in his room until the rest of the gang enter
hey aang were going into town to find some dinner
clutching his stomach well i am pretty hungry maybe dinners a good idea
here offering a fire nation bandana tie this around your head it will cover your arrow
im not going out if i cant wear my arrow proudly he lies back down
aang come on be practical
placing a hand on sokkas shoulder you guys go ahead without us well catch up to you toph and sokka exit katara sits on aangs bed placing a hand on his shoulder i think i understand why being a secret bothers you so much you dont want people to think you failed
youre right i dont but the problem is i did fail
aang thats not true
getting up it is true i was in ba sing se i was there but i lost and now the earth kingdom is fallen for good
its not for good getting up too remember theres still a plan the invasion
and i hate the invasion plan too rips down the fire nation flag covering his staff i dont want you or anyone else risking your lives to fix my mistakes ive always known that i would have to face the fire lord but now i know i need to do it alone
moving to comfort him aang 
katara please just go  please
exiting is there anything you need
i need to redeem myself i need my honor back
back at the fire nation capital zuko returns to the royal palace and prepares to face his father ozai he breathes deeply and enters we briefly see ozai before cutting back to team avatars ship katara returns to aangs room
i brought you some food notices aang has gone missing oh no  drops the food tray and runs
cut to aang flying on his glider back at the royal palace zuko bows before ozai
youve been away for a long time i see the weight of your travels has changed you you have redeemed yourself my son approaches zuko the camera pans up to view ozais full face for the first time welcome home
aang struggles to remain in flight against his injuries back on the ship katara runs toward bato and hakoda she is in tears
ill leave you two alone exits
whats wrong katara
he left
what
aang he just took his glider and disappeared he has this ridiculous notion that he has to save the world alone that its all his responsibility
maybe thats his way of being brave
its not brave its selfish and stupid we could be helping him and i know the world needs him but doesnt he know how much we need him too how can he just leave us behind
youre talking about me too arent you
how could you leave us dad she attempts to wipe away the tears i mean i know we had grangran and she loved us but we were just so lost without you
hakoda moves to comfort her as she turns away
im so sorry katara
embraces hakoda i understand why you left i really do and i know that you had to go so why do i still feel this way im so sad and angry and hurt
i love you more than anything you and your brother are my entire world i thought about you every day when i was gone and every night when i went to sleep i would lie awake missing you so much it would ache
the scene switches to the royal palace
i am proud of you prince zuko i am proud because you and your sister conquered ba sing se i am proud because when your loyalty was tested by your treacherous uncle you did the right thing and captured the traitor and i am proudest of all of your most legendary accomplishment you slayed the avatar
shocked what did you hear
azula told me everything she said she was amazed and impressed at your power and ferocity at the moment of truth
aang continues his flight struggling he comes upon a fire nation blockade
a blockade
he takes a deep breath and swims under it upon emerging he finds a tree bark and rides it like a surfboard through the water a storm turns the seas very choppy he falls off and into the water and his staff flies away we return to the palace azula is asleep when zuko enters her room
whyd you do it
youre going to have to be a little more specific
why did you tell father that i was the one who killed the avatar
cant this wait until the morning
it cant
sighs and opens her eyes fine you seemed so worried about how father would treat you because you hadnt captured the avatar i figured if i gave you the credit youd have nothing to worry about
but why
getting out of bed call it a generous gesture i wanted to thank you for your help and i was happy to share the glory
youre lying
walking past zuko if you say so 
you have another motive for doing this i just havent figured out what it is
please zuko what ulterior motive could i have what could i possibly gain by letting you get all the glory for defeating the avatar approaching close to zuko she places a hand on his shoulder unless somehow the avatar was actually alive all that glory would suddenly turn to shame and foolishness but you said it yourself that was impossible zuko begins to leave sleep well zuzu
back in the sea aang struggles to stay above water or reach his glider after letting out a scream a wave overcomes him and he falls into the water he reemerges after a brief time
im not gonna make it i failed within the lightning strikes the spirit of roku appears before aang roku
you havent failed aang
but everyone thinks im dead again they think ive abandoned them and im losing this war im letting the whole world down
if anyone is to blame for the state of the world it is me i should have seen this war coming and prevented it you inherited my problems and my mistakes but i believe you are destined to redeem me and save the world
i dont know
moonlight shines on on aang as yues spirit appears above
you already saved the world and youll save the world again but you cant give up
the storm ends the spirit of roku disappears while yues spirit descends toward aang
youre right i wont give up
he creates a wave and surfs it with the tree bark yues spirit watches him leave and ascends back to moon aang is washed up at the base of a volcano on the same crescent island where rokus temple once was later momo finds him and licks his face waking him up katara sokka and toph find him reaching him via appa katara runs to hug him her worried look changing to happiness
youre okay
they all including momo and appa come together for a group hug
i have so much to do
i know but youll have our help
you didnt think you could get out of training just by coming to the fire nation did you
what about the invasion
well join up with my dad and the invasion force the day of the eclipse
notices aangs damaged staff has washed ashore hey whats  oh its your glider
its okay if someone saw it it would give away my identity its better for now that no one knows im alive
flies up and sticks it in the volcanos lava trails causing it to catch fire as they depart scene fades to credits
the episode opens with a shot of the incline leading to the royal caldera city as the camera pans above to an aerial shot of the city shot cuts to the fire nation royal palace before cutting to zukos bedroom to show zuko tossing and turning in his bed unable to sleep he opens his eyes and gets up donning a cloak cut to the rim of the volcano as he walks through a path cut to the capital city prison as zuko walks toward it cut to an overhead shot of him stopping and looking above cut to a guard walking around a balcony who spots him
whos there
zuko without speaking a word turns around and walks away the guard seeing zuko leave resumes his patrol scene changes to some islands at day time as a mysterious cloud goes toward one of the islands at an abnormal speed cut to the cloud descending on one of the islands
from inside the cloud i think i see a cave below
commanding sh keep quiet
aang airbends the cloud surrounding appa as the flying bison lands sokka jumps to the ground from appa and reconnoiters before crossing his arms and looking toward team avatar
great job with the cloud camo but next time lets disguise ourselves as the kind of cloud that knows how to keep its mouth shut he reconnoiters again
cut to the toph katara and aang standing in front of sokka who is reconnoitering sarcastically yeah we wouldnt want a bird to hear us chatting up there and turn us in
turning back toward the other three hey were in enemy territory he points above as camera zooms back to show four toucan puffins standing on a rock behind him those are enemy birds
one toucan puffin jumps onto sokkas head and screeches cut to the other three as they laugh and walk toward the cave with sokka following behind suddenly he jumps above them and comes diving down he looks suspicious as shot cuts to an aerial shot of him running into the cave followed by the rest of the group
well this is it cut to sokka standing in front of the other three this is how well be living until the invasion begins his head drops each time he says the word cave hiding in cave after cave after cave after cave 
cut to katara standing near aang from behind sokka sokka we dont need to become cave people what we need is some new clothes
yeah blending in is better than hiding out cut to aang and katara if we get fire nation disguises smiling we would be just as safe as we would be hiding in a cave
cut to toph who is sitting down with her legs slightly folded plus they have real food out there does anyone want to sit in the dirt and eat cave hoppers
toph punches the cave wall causing cave hoppers to jump out momo grabs one and eats it he turns around and spits out a cave hopper limb
looks like we got outvoted sport lets get some new clothes

glances around the room as the class recites the oath fire lord  forefathers 
with my mind i seek ways to better my country and with my feet may our march of civilization continue
firebenders  fire lord  wah bah blah blah the class snickers at him as they sit down as the teacher looks on with a stern expression
since its obviously hilarious to mock our national oath well begin with a pop quiz on our great march of civilization the class groans and picks up their pens question one what year did fire lord sozin battle the air nation army aang raises his hand kuzon
is that a trick question the air nomads didnt have a formal military sozin defeated them by ambush the entire class stares at him dumbfounded
well i dont know how you could possibly know more than our national history book unless you were there a hundred years ago
ill just write down my best guess
the camera fades to show the music teacher standing at a podium with the rest of the class before him playing instruments aang plays loudly in very discordant notes while moving dancing while sitting
kuzon
stopping i know im a terrible tsungi hornist
no child that hullabaloo going on with your feet is that a nervous disorder
i was just dancing you do dances here in the homeland right
not really no
dancing is not conducive to a proper learning environment young people must have rigid discipline and order
but what about expressing yourself
i know sometimes were so ruled by our love for our nation that we cant control our own bodies he puts his hand to his face at what he is saying before continuing on if you must you may march in place quietly next time the urge hits you
he settles back down to the podium and the class resumes playing aang plays a few notes marching in place and stops looking very dismayed at this cut to the school yard aang is walking through it and all the other students stop and stare at him murmuring among themselves
waves at aang uh hi kuzon i really liked that crazy dance you were doing
thanks on ji i could show it to you again if you like ah he jumps as a blast of fire hits the ground at his feet
whatd you say colony trash youre gonna show her something
nervously just some dance movements
nobody shows my on ji anything especially movements
hide attempts to strike aang but aang easily steps out of the way the other students gather around to watch hide continues trying to punch at aang but he continuously evades with ease much to hides frustration aang gets behind hides back and moves to the side to match hides movements aang knocks back hide by butting him hide tries to strike aang two more times but aang slides behind hide through his legs hide tries punching aang two more times and falls down as aang side steps and trips him the headmaster arrives and hide sniffles as he gets up to his knees he is seen with tears in his eyes as the headmaster talks
angrily picking fights on your second day we need to have a conference to discuss your punishment bring your parents to my office after school

he pulls her out into the room and whispers into her ear and everybody stops to stare at them as the two extend their arms to each other and begin circling each other and performing dance moves
aang everyones watching

waving a hand in the air this is incredible its like my inhibitions just disappear he sees the headmaster come into the cave and immediately stops dancing and attempts to shrink into his robes okay theyre back again
aang continues to dance past as everyone else stops until the headmaster talks

our detour into town today has completely thrown off our schedule its gonna take some serious finagling to get us back on track
sarcastically finagle away oh schedule master
well for starters it looks like well need to wake up fortythree minutes earlier every day
fortythree minutes
pointing to various spots on his schedule look we only have a few weeks to get to the fire lord in time for the invasion and the eclipse which by the way only lasts for eight minutes and we just lost a whole day so if we want to make up the time and stay on schedule we have to wake up early
well im not waking up early
or we could just cut out all of our eating breaks
what
no way
forget it
gets a sly look on his face i got it hows this from now on well take food breaks and potty breaks at the same time
katara toph and aang express their disgust at this idea with aang doing a spit take
hey it might be gross but its efficient either way we have to leave here first thing tomorrow morning
closeup of kataras face who looks distraught at sokkas words cut to an aerial view of the village the following morning and cut to the campsite appa lies on his side groaning while katara ministers to him
whats the matter katara
i think appas sick
panicking what appas sick thats awful
wow sokka i didnt realize you cared so much
of course i care i might as well just throw our schedule away now pulls out his schedule he stops and looks at the group cut to a shot of the rest of the gang giving him the evil eye and he quickly changes his tone rushing solicitously to appas side and im concerned because my big furry friend doesnt feel well
he must have gotten sick from being in the polluted water
he doesnt look sick you okay buddy appa groans and aang pulls out appas purple tongue his tongue is purple that cant be good katara can you heal him
it looks like he needs some medicine maybe we can find the right herbs in town
momo arrives and attempts to lick appas tongue before being pulled off by aang cut to the village which is bustling and lively one villager pole vaults from one house to another
is it just me or does this place seem different
yeah are the people  happier
the little boy from the previous day runs by bouncing a ball and katara smiles to herself the kids walk up to xudocks market
hey xu whats going on with everyone today
drinks from a ladle ah something amazing happened last night food was delivered to our village by a mysterious and wonderful person  the painted lady
the painted who now
the painted lady he places a miniature statuette of the spirit down on the counter shes part of our towns lore they say shes a river spirit who watches over our town in times of need i always thought she was just a legend until now
see we dont need to help these people they already have someone to help them all we need is medicine for our sick friend
medicine sorry all the medicine we have goes to the factory thats why theres so many sick people in our village
looks like we need to stay another night so appa can rest
sighs i guess youre right you got any more food to sell
goes under the counter and emerges holding a fish in each hand would you like the oneheaded fish or the twoheaded fish he turns the fish on the left sideways to show the second head
ponders twoheaded the rest of the group lowers their heads and small sweat drops appear what you get more for your money that way holds up the polluted fish
the rest of the group get even bigger exaggerated sweat drops as they express their disgust and run away from sokka who follows behind with the polluted fish 
fade to the village late that night a figure resembling the painted lady glides over the water on a carpet of fog and enters the village she steps into a hut where several people are sleeping on the floor and bends over each of them in turn healing them with a blue glow her last patient is the mother of the little boy seen earlier her son sleeping at her side he wakes as the painted lady turns to go and silently follows her out the door
thank you painted lady
the lady stops and nods her head before disappearing into the water cut to the village the next day dock polishes his figurine with a rag as sokka steps up to the counter
hi dock is xu around
let me check  he runs around the shop and ducks beneath the counter to switch hats hey there back again are ya
pushes sokka away we need more food slams the money on the counter our friend is still sick and we cant leave until hes better
xu obligingly presents them with a platter of polluted clams the camera pans in on the clams sokka comically slides in behind them and gives silent chuckle along with a comical annoyed symbol on his forehead it appears he has an idea brewing
oh well thats too bad maybe if you guys are lucky the painted lady will visit you in the night and heal your friend
picks up the clams sarcastically and maybe shell cook us a midnight snack and well all have a singalong
not getting the sarcasm sokka looks annoyed now yeah may be you know last night she visited us again healed most of our sick folks
is that why this place seems so festive
a villagers raises a large statue of the painted lady in the town square everyone cheers and applause
yep its all because of the painted lady
can you believe how much an entire village can be affected by one lady i mean  spirit
well i hope she returns every night otherwise this place would go right back to the way it was
gets annoyed why would you say that look how much better off these people are
yeah now but without her they wouldnt be able to fend for themselves if she really wanted to help she would use her spirit magic to blow up that factory he makes mocking gestures to indicate explosive spirit magic he crosses his arms with a smile katara gets even more annoyed the screen pans to the right to show aang who has his arms crossed not impressed
spirit magic doesnt work that way sokka its more like  he waves his body with arms in the air making similar gestures to indicate spirit magic katara storms away from the two
sokka wraps and arm over aangs shoulder and the two combined their little imitation but far more ridiculous wooooooooo  sokka chuckles
cut to katara on the edge of a dock looking out toward the factory cut to the campsite that night katara slips out of her sleeping bag and stuffs dried grass into it to disguise her absence she dons a makeshift painted lady costume wrapping a ragged gown around her katara bends the water to make a mirror so she can apply the markings she puts on a wide conical hat similar to the painted ladys but with a diaphanous white veil covering her face she glides away toward the village but not quietly enough she wakes momo and he wakes aang by jumping on him
whats the matter buddy katara leaves team avatar its her excited waves his hand to katara and puts on his headband hello painted lady spirit
katara shocked quickly flees from aang meanwhile aang uses his airbending to accelerate his run the camera moves to a hill as katara climbs up and continues on as aang easily keeps up
jumps up the hill excuse me i dont mean to bother you but my friends sick and were on kind of a tight schedule continues to follow her down the hill as she crosses the river wait but im a great bridge between your world and mine aang freezes some water to form stepping stones to cross the river i know hei bai were close personal friends katara moves faster and aang jumps on a wooden bridge katara runs out of the river onto the docks and notices aangs reflection in the water she looks up and sees aang running across a roof heeey he suddenly hits a pole katara flinches and feels sorry for him but continues on across the river to the other side she stops to look out at the village thinking she is safe but aang drops in front of her my names aang im the avatar lifts his headband and points at his arrow
using a disguised voice well hello avatar i wish i could talk but i am very busy
yeah me too i hate that looks at kataras face from behind the veil you know youre really pretty spirit i dont meet too many spirits but the ones i do meet not very attractive looks at katara suspiciously tries to look under the hat
giggles nervously thank you but
you seem familiar too
a lot of people say that
suspicious no you really seem familiar
look i really should get going covers her face and runs but aang uses his airbending and blasts her hat up into the air exposing her
katara
guiltily hi aang
shocked youre the painted lady pointing at katara but how
i wasnt her at first i was just trying to help the village takes her hat off but since everyone thought thats who i was anyway i guess i just kinda became her drops her hat on the ground
so youve been sneaking out at night wait is appa even sick
he might be sick of the purple berries ive been feeding him but other than that hes fine
i cant believe you lied to everyone so you could help these people
im sorry i know i shouldnt have 
happily no i think its great youre like a secret hero
well if you wanna help theres one more thing i have to do
aang gives her a curious look cut to the fire nation factory aang and katara run along the rivers edge toward it aang looks at the polluted water
you wanna destroy this factory
yes sokka was just kidding but he was right getting rid of this factory is the only way to help these people permanently
aang and katara enter and move to different sides of the factory katara uses waterbending to cut the metal hooks that hang barrels of a magma aang with protective gloves on overturns bigger hanging barrels smiling at his work aang uses earthbending to break apart the pipe system in the factory katara bends a huge wave of water through the windows and floods the factory the scene cuts to outside as the factory explodes from within and muck stops flowing from the pipes cut to aang and katara walking back to their campsite aang laughs and makes explosion noises
shhh quietly we dont wanna wake sokka she turns and sees that sokka and toph are awake hi sokka we were just out on a morning walk
angrily and disappointed oh really a morning walk dumps the hay out of kataras sleeping bag i know youre the painted lady i know youve been sneaking out at night and i know youve been lying about appa and been feeding him sticks out his own tongue purpleising tongue berries toph sticks out her tongue and shows that it is purple and holds up a bag of berries which momo starts eating katara what you did put our whole mission in jeopardy were leaving right now
katara walks past sokka sadly sokka confronts aang as he follows
and how long did you know about this
defensively hey i just found out this morning
aang sprints away with airbending the scene changes to the fire nation factory where a man can be seen coming out of the smoke and looking angrily toward the town cut to team avatar packing but they pause when they hear buzzing the factory workers are shown headed for the town on jet skis cut to the gang on a cliff looking down at the river below
approaching and kneeling down with the others whats going on
fire nation soldiers are heading toward the village

angrily no i will never ever turn my back on people who need me gets up im going down to that village and i am gonna do whatever i can

sokka you really do have a heart the two hug
wiping away tears he really does have a heart doesnt he

as roku turns back and starts to leave sozin full of rage jumps from his throne and delivers an immensely powerful fire stream as the flames go out roku is nowhere to be seen sozin widens his eyes in suprise expression becoming blank as he looks around suddenly roku bursts from the ground behind sozin revealing that he has burrowed into the ground with earthbending to defend from sozins attack before sozin can turn back roku delivers a powerful air blast at the fire lord which causes him to slam on the gates of the room as sozin falls down roku immediately earthbends a pillar of earth that lifts sozin into the air and pins him by the back of his robes to the ceiling cut to a closeup of avatar roku as he brings his hands together in front of his face and enters the avatar state cut to a shot of the entire throne room as roku breaks the pillars of the throne room cut to an aerial shot of the palace as it is destroyed cut to sozin uncovering his face roku airbends an air spout and raises himself to sozin

unfortunately my success didnt last long aang there was no way i could do it all
shot cuts to roku looking up the top of the volcano as the camera pans up and focuses on the mouth of the volcano it violently expels another giant wave of lava roku runs toward the volcano and leaps roku blows a powerful blast of air from his mouth at the lava which cools and hardens as roku lands on it suddenly a blast of poisonous gas spouts to his right he turns and covers his face he turns to the jet airbending it away suddenly lava appears on his right which he airbends and quickly another jet of gases blasts to his left and he quickly airbends it as well
to aang battling the elements was hard enough i had to do it while i could barely breathe the poisonous volcanic gases were overwhelming
cut to an overhead shot of the sky directly over the eruption lightning crashes around the crater as fang comes flying the summit emits another lava fountain fang pulls back narrowly escaping the blast and roars

roku turns his body from side to side and enters the avatar state with a powerful blow from his fist roku earthbends a tremor through the volcano breaking out the back side of the crater which lessens the lava flow as the lava flows down the second volcano erupts as roku no longer in the avatar state hopelessly drops his head cut to a view of roku from behind as sozin on a blue dragon appears

dont breathe the toxic gas
as the two run a jet of toxic gas shoots up directly next to sozin roku quickly airbends it away to protect sozin suddenly gas erupts directly into rokus face causing him to be disoriented
shaking cut to rokus point of view he lifts his hands to look at them as they blur out of focus its too much
overwhelmed by the poisons roku falls to his knees he looks up toward sozin and holds out his hand for help

annoyed oh sokka just hold hands
sokka stops talking and without moving he thrusts out his hand to hold kataras shot cuts to an aerial shot of team avatar holding hands and looking out toward the ocean fade to credits
the episode opens in fire fountain city where a giant statue of fire lord ozai roaring is shown with flames coming from the fists and out of the mouth the camera moves down to toph who is seen running from someone but turns around and is caught with a net and falls to the ground she angrily looks in front of her at someone
angrily how could you do this to me you betrayed me
the camera cuts to a shot of katara who is glaring back at toph
crosses her arms you brought this on yourself i had no choice turns away from toph with her arms folded
toph is dragged away in the net all the while glaring back at katara the screen fades to three days earlier toph and katara are seen facing each other each taking a fighting stance the latter controlling two streams of water in her hands aang appears on the screen tying his headband over his eyes like a blindfold
okay im ready for some training
he turns to face the girls and takes two steps forward in a stance similar to tophs upon impact with the second step he picks up vibrations from the ground with seismic sense he quickly dodges three earth pillars that appear out of the ground near him he hears a water attack coming from katara and redirects it at her he quickly launches a boulder at toph who catches it and stops it
good job twinkle toes visualize then attack
she launches the boulder back at aang who burrows into a hole with earthbending the boulder instead hits katara square in the chest knocking her down she stands back up and brushes dust off of her
maybe you should take your own advice toph
whats the matter cant handle a little dirt madame fussybritches
kataras eyebrow twitches and she glares at toph with her vein shown on her head before she angrily creates a wave and sends it at toph who gets splashed by it and becomes annoyed
oh sorry did i splash you mudslug
katara creates an ice ramp and toph creates an earth ramp both proceeding to head straight for each other they crash and both of the girls go flying
are we taking a break
meanwhile sokka is seen hiding behind aang with an evil smile he quickly gets up and charges at aang the background changes to a rushing one
screaming sneak attack
aang casually and still looking away from sokka creates an earth wall which stops sokka dead in his tracks he lowers the wall which causes sokka to fall down
while raising his blindfold and turning to face sokka sokka sneak attacks dont work if you yell it out loud
katara and toph are seen wrestling in a puddle of mud
hungry for a mud pie kicks mud in kataras face
wiping mud off of her face ill give you a mud pie
katara waterbends a stream of mud at toph knocking her down she quickly gets up and earthbends a pillar underneath katara which sends her flying toward a wall she starts running toward katara but stops at the last second when they hear aang
uh guys i thought we were supposed to be training me
takes a few steps forward covered in mud calmly very well pupil i believe weve had enough training for today turns and walks away
while katara cleans up earthbends the mud off of herself and runs toward aang and sokka lets go have some fun
yeah
simultaneously with aang yes
aang sokka and toph head to fire fountain city sokka is carrying his sword horizontally across his shoulders he looks up and sees messenger hawks flying in and out of a large coop
look at all those messenger hawks you know ive been thinking about getting one for myself that way i wouldnt have to talk to anyone i could just send them messages
i gotta say i like the idea of not talking to you sokka glares at her
while holding up a silver piece so guys what are we gonna get with our last silver piece
stops walking we can get more money they both look back at her right there points to an area beneath them aang and sokka move back to look where she is pointing
in the area is a table with two men sitting across from each other with people around them watching the action the table has three shells on it all upside down the first man places some money on the table and the second man a scam artist lifts the shells to reveal that the middle one has a rock underneath it he places the shells back down as they were and starts moving them around
this is where you seeing people are at a disadvantage everyone guesses wrong because the dealer moves the rock at the last minute but i can feel it with my earthbending as she says this the scam artist continues to move the shells around as the gambler tries to focus on the shell with the rock and right before stopping the scam artist quickly and inconspicuously earthbends the rock from underneath one of the shells into his sleeve
the scam artist stops moving the shells and arranges them how they originally were horizontally right in front of him the gambler points at the shell in the middle which the scam artist lifts to reveal nothing underneath the gambler stands up and walks away crying a few more people move and the dealer notices toph and that she is blind
to toph you there wanna play a friendly game
how can i possibly play waves her hand in front of her face im blind
you dont have to see to be lucky
toph sits in front of the table and feels around it pretending to be helpless she places their last silver piece on the table the scam artist shows the rock under the shell in the middle and starts moving them around this time he tosses one rock from his sleeves into each of the two empty shells toph senses this and smiles slyly when he stops toph points to the one on her left which has a rock underneath winning about two silver pieces
flameyo toph
wow fancy guessing you are amazing at this plays with a few silver pieces in his hands would you like to make the game a little more interesting
curiously more interesting how
points at sokkas sword well lets say you toss in your friends fine sword there grabs a big bag of money then ill put up twenty silver pieces against it and thats more interesting
grabs sokkas sword ill do it for forty silver pieces sokka stares at them with his mouth wide open
forty silver pieces it is drops some more money into the bag and starts moving the shells faster this time
the scam artist moves the first two rocks into his sleeves which toph senses as she smiles slyly again he attempts to do the same with the third rock but toph inconspicuously clutches her fist causing the rock to move back underneath the shell which the scam artist does not notice when he stops she smiles and points at the shell in the middle
moves his hand over to the shell about to lift it sorry little lady but lifts up the shell and sees the rock which shocks and confuses him huh stares closely at the rock
i won she grabs the bag of money and sokka grabs his sword as they run off
cut to toph aang and sokka heading back to camp laughing and carrying baskets full of goods katara is seen cooking something in a pot as they all drop their baskets onto the ground and katara looks at the baskets with curiosity
where did you guys get the money to buy all this stuff
toph got us money grabs an apple and takes a bite out of it as he sits down she scammed one of those guys in town who moves the shells around all sneakylike he mimics the scam artist moving the shells with his hand kataras expression shows disapproval
sits down too she used earthbending to win the game classic
ah so she cheated
starts to bite her apple but stops to defend herself hey i only cheated because he was cheating smiles i cheated a cheater closes her eyes in confidence whats wrong with that
im just saying this isnt something we should make a habit of doing
why because its fun and you hate fun
i dont hate fun places momo on her head like a hat while grinning unconvincingly see fun momo slips off her head screeches at her and runs away
stands up katara slightly lifts his headband to reveal his airbender tattoo and bows ill personally make you an avatar promise that we wont make a habit of doing these scams
the camera switches to the city where aang goes from bowing to doing tricks with the money in his hands and runs off a few citizens are seen playing a dice like game the two winners see toph holding a bag of money and call her over she tosses the two die one lands on three which is the highest number and the other is about to go from three to zero cut to toph who twitches her head to the left slightly without any of the others seeing causing the die to move back to the three meaning she wins much to the winners dismay and sokkas and aangs joy
cut to an area where a carnival is being hosted where a big man tries a testyourstrength game in which you need to use a hammer to launch a ball up to ring the bell but can only make it about halfway toph jiggles a bag of money and walks over aang and sokka watch from behind as she hands the man in charge of the game the money and places her hands on the hammer she struggles to move it over her head and behind her which makes all in the crowd snicker and laugh toph smiles again as she uses earthbending to launch the hammers head from behind her to the lever with great force the ball is launched so hard that it launches out of the game destroying the top of it which leaves everyone shocked she casually grabs her winnings and leaves as the ball crashes into a tent behind causing everyone to cringe at the sound and looks back to see the damage
the camera next cuts to a street where a carriage is being pulled by a dragon moose cut to a sideshot of the inside of the carriage where a noble opens his cup of tea to his delight and waves the aroma to his face toph emerges from a dark alley and creates a small rock right in front of one of the wheels to stop the cart she falls back pretending to have been hit the noble peeks outside the carriage window and sees toph he jumps out of the carriage and starts to run but is stopped by what looks like a fire nation guard who is really sokka in his wang fire costume he notices toph being run over and crosses his arms angrily at the noble who gets on his knees and begs sokka he places twelve small bags of money as bribery one after another in sokkas arms and sokka smiles and winks at him to assure him that sokka will keep this secret the camera cuts to back at camp
guys i think these scams have gone far enough if you keep doing them something bad is gonna happen
could you for once stop being such a sourpuss and just lighten up tosses some money to katara
angrily oh im sorry you think i should be more like you like some wild child tosses the money back at toph
yeah maybe maybe then youd see sokka grabs the money off the ground how great we have it i mean look at us leans back on the rock behind her and crosses her arms behind her head were traveling around the world making easy money having fun with no parents to tell us what to do

later on at camp sokka and aang are sitting together toph and katara are sitting at separate edges of the cliff their backs to one another
hey aang you wanna test out my messenger hawk with me ive got an idea

i think were gonna run into a similar problem hawky screeches sorry hawky looks like im gonna have to do this without your help walks to toph come on we need to talk
toph exhales annoyed the camera cuts to another area of the camp katara is bathing in a lake directly below a cliff sokka and toph walk up to the edge of the cliff and sit down not noticing katara
so lemme guess you brought me out here to tell me that your sisters not as annoying as i make her out to be
nah shes pretty much a pain katara looking up at their feet from below and behind glares and looks away shes always got to be right about everything and she gets all bossy and involved and in your business 
yeah i dont know how you could deal with it
actually in a way i rely on it katara looks back up at them
i dont understand
when our mom died that was the hardest time in my life our family was a mess but katara she had so much strength she stepped up and took on so much responsibility she helped fill the void that was left by our mom
i guess i never thought about that
im gonna tell you something crazy i never told anyone this before but honestly im not sure i can remember what my mother looked like it really seems like my whole life kataras been the one looking out for me shes always been the one thats there and now when i try to remember my mom kataras is the only face i can picture katara touched by what sokka says is reduced to tears
the truth is sometimes katara does act motherly but thats not always a bad thing shes compassionate and kind and she actually cares about me wipes away tears from her left eye you know the real me thats more than my own mom katara deeply touched by tophs words sinks slightly into the water toph punches sokka in the arm dont ever tell her i said any of this
hey my lips are sealed
at around nightfall katara is sitting next to momo who is napping with katara rubbing the top of his head katara is looking down in front of her saddened she sees sokka and toph walking toward her and walks up to toph when they reach each other sokka keeps walking
hi toph um i wanna
holds up her hand in a stop fashion katara stop you dont need to apologize i was the one being stupid these scams are out of control and im done with them
smiles actually i wasnt going to apologize i was gonna say  i wanna pull a scam with you aang and sokka stare at her from behind extremely shocked
also shocked what you wanna pull a scam
not just any scam the ultimate scam sokka and aang still staring at her with shock look at each other and faint foaming from the mouth slightly katara puts her arm around tophs shoulder who gives a sly smile whaddaya say toph just me and you one last go you in
excited you know im in now whats this idea of yours they walk away and leave aang and sokka behind who are now unconscious and foaming at the mouth
the scene changes to katara and toph going over the plan katara is looking at tophs wanted poster
the plan is simple this wanted poster says youre worth a lot of money ten times more than youve made in all of your scams so im gonna turn you in and collect the reward then you metalbend yourself out of jail and were on our way as she speaks the screen fades to the beginning of the episode where toph is seen running from the authorities and is caught in a net
angrily how could you do this to me you betrayed me
crosses her arms you brought this on yourself i had no choice turns away from toph
toph is dragged away in the net all the while glaring back at katara katara glances back slightly and gives a sly smile she is joined by the chief of authorities
you did the right thing by turning in the runaway
the right thing is its own reward
well im happy to hear you say that
pauses for a moment but i still want the actual reward
of course right this way
meanwhile a female guard drags toph into a jail she throws toph from the net into a wooden cell and closes it toph feels the floor of her cell but is shocked when she cant sense any earth in it she gets up and looks outside the cell at the guard
hey what kind of cell is this
a wooden one she walks away as toph becomes visibly worried
in an office the town authority grabs a box underneath a desk and looks around in it a door opens behind katara who is standing across the desk from the chief the chief closes the box and points at katara
thats her thats the girl you were looking for
katara turns and sees the assassin with the third eye tattooed on his head aka sparkysparkyboom man walk in leaving her shocked and horrified meanwhile at camp sokka and aang are worried the latter pacing back and forth
do you think this scam of theirs should be taking this long
i was just wondering the same thing wed better check it out to hawky and momo you two behave pointing at appa appas in charge appa lifts his head as the two animals start screeching at each other as soon as sokka and aang leave but stop as soon as appa roars at them
the camera cuts to tophs cell which now holds katara too they both are sitting on the floor downcast when toph suddenly realizes something
wait its a trap
sarcastically really no kidding is that why were sitting in a wooden cage right now gee howd you figure out it was a trap
not for us katara were the bait he wants aang kataras eyes widen with realization
i cant believe im so stupid see this is exactly why im against these scams i knew this would happen
but this was your idea
i know i wanted to show that im not so motherly i wanted to show you that i can have fun too
katara you are fun if nothing else youre at least fun to argue with
i know your relationship with your parents is complicated and i shouldnt have said what i said
its okay i was really mad when you said that because  well because maybe its true starts to cry i try not to think about it but when i left i probably really hurt them
katara embraces toph meanwhile sokka and aang walk around town looking for katara and toph the town is seemingly abandoned
where do you think they might be
where do you think anyone is the assassin is seen walking across a rooftop behind them aang hears him inhaling and becomes shocked when he turns and sees him sokka watch out he grabs sokka as they dodge a blast from the assassin and take cover behind an ozai statue its sparkysparkyboom man
you know im starting to think that name doesnt quite fit
the assassin jumps down from the roof and fires another blast at them they barely dodge it but get sent flying back by the blast which shakes the ceiling of toph and kataras cell toph is trying to break out while katara is sitting down
what are we gonna do
i dont know i wish we had some earth or water we need bendables
what about your meteor bracelet you can make a saw
i left it back at camp sits down i was worried they would take it
katara exhales deeply and wipes her forehead with the back of her hand her eyes widen with realization as she notices her hand is covered in sweat she smiles and quickly stands up to start running in place
confused um katara are you okay
just fine
still confused well what are you doing
im making my own water
katara stops running and wipes her forehead again this time she uses waterbending to use the midair sweat as blades to cut through the wooden cage toph stands up upon noticing this
amazed katara youre a genius a sweaty stinky genius
katara waterbends another blade of sweat this time from under her arms cut to aang and sokka being chased by the assassin the assassin fires a blast at them which they dodge but still get sent flying sokka crashes onto a wheelbarrow which they hide behind
this guy is too good he shoots fire from his brain
we should split up he cant chase us both
the assassin walks out of the smoke aang runs off from his left and sokka from his right the assassin fires a blast at the wheelbarrow and blows it up aang runs past him on a roof to his left the assassin quickly turns and fires another blast which sends aang flying into the ozai statue he falls from the statue to the ground he looks up and sees the assassin standing above him inhale about to fire another blast at aang but his head is suddenly encased in ice the assassin moves and aang sees katara sokka and toph standing behind the assassin
aang get up she helps him up and they run away
lets get out of here
the assassin breaks the ice with brute force he launches another blast at team avatar but toph quickly launches a boulder at the blast blowing the boulder up a pebble from the boulder flies toward the assassin and hits him square in his third eye which momentarily stuns and angers him he tries to fire another blast but with his chi is blocked he ignites the air around him and gets sent back headfirst into a wall when he stands up and shakes it off team avatar is gone
still running hey i got it the perfect name for that guy combustion man
good job sokka now lets get outta here before combustion man catches us
see it fits so well
later that night the gang flies to another camp spot on appa

fade to credits
narrating a preview previously on avatar 
youre looking at the only waterbender in the whole south pole this ship has haunted my tribe when grangran was a little girl it was part of the fire nations first attacks
the legend said the moon was the first waterbender our ancestor saw how it pushed and pulled the tides and learned how to do it themselves
i always noticed my waterbending is stronger at night
what are you doing
im making my own water
the episode opens to a waxing gibbous moon glowing in the night sky the scene cuts to a shot of a field of fire lilies a mountain in the distance cuts to a forested area where team avatar is camping out among the trees the darkness of the night gives the landscape an ominous feeling
telling a ghost story suddenly they heard something down the hall in the dark oooh  it came into the torchlight  and they knew the blade of wing fung was haunted draws sword stands up and points it toward the fire yells dramatically oohaaah
cuts to shot of the entire group sitting around the campfire aang is lying down katara is hunched over in a sitting position and toph sits casually all three looking unamused
unimpressed i think i like the man with a sword for a hand better
water tribe slumber parties must stink
no wait ive got one and this is a true southern water tribe story
sitting down is this one of those a friend of my cousin knew some guy that this happened to stories
no it happened to mom
upon hearing this sokka stiffens cuts to aang who sits up to listen intently
one winter when mom was a girl a snowstorm buried the whole village for weeks a month later mom noticed she hadnt seen her friend nini since the storm so mom and some others went to check on ninis family when they got there no one was home cuts to groundlevel shot of the group sitting around the fire the camera panning slightly to the right just a fire flickering in the fireplace while the men went out to search mom stayed in the house when she was alone she heard a voice in a scary voice its so cold and i cant get warm sokka stiffens in fear mom turned and saw nini standing by the fire she was blue like she was frozen mom ran outside for help but when everyone came back nini was gone
aang uses momos ears to cover his face in fear the camera shifts to show sokka hiding behind a gnarled tree stump
peering from behind a tree trunk whered she go
no one knows ninis house stands empty to this day but sometimes people see smoke coming up from the chimney like little nini is still trying to get warm
the camera zooms out to where the gang is all huddled by the fire suddenly toph straightens up and places her hands on the ground
gasping wait guys did you hear that aang katara and sokka clutch each other tightly too stiff to move with toph standing alertly i hear people under the mountain and theyre screaming
sokka assuming toph is joking relaxes his grip
pft nice try toph
cuts to shot of the campsite viewed through the ominous looking tree branches no im serious i hear something
youre probably just jumpy from the ghost stories 
it just  stopped
cuts back to him and katara still hugging sokka sitting close by all right now im getting scared
offcamera from behind group hello children
everyone screams in terror upon hearing the strange womans voice and scrambles from the ground an elderly woman emerges from the shadows
sorry to frighten you my name is hama cuts to sideview of the campsite you children shouldnt be out in the forest by yourselves at night cuts to groundlevel shot of hama standing over the fire i have an inn nearby why dont you come back there for some spiced tea and warm beds
sheepishly places arm behind head yes please
hama smiles and begins walking away the scene changes to a village her local inn lying atop a small hill cuts to inside the building where tea is being poured into a teacup cuts to shot of the group sitting around the kitchen table
thanks for letting us stay here tonight you have a lovely inn
sets teapot down arent you sweet walks over to her seat and sits down you know you should be careful people have been disappearing in those woods you were camping in
what do you mean disappearing
sets her teacup down when the moon turns full people walk in and they dont come out stand up and holds up her teapot cheerfully smiling who wants more tea
cuts to shot of the group who has by now fallen completely silent the camera panning to the right to show all of them sitting around the table
dont worry youll all be completely safe here clasps hands together and smiles why dont i show you to your rooms and you can get a good nights rest
the scene changes to sokkas room where he is lying in bed with momo asleep on the floor cuts to shot of him in bed as he rolls over a creaking noise comes from outside frightening him he draws his sword quickly while momo scampers under the covers
i know momo places sword back inside holster and sets it down this place is creepy lies back down on the pillow and pulls the covers over him i dont know if im gonna be able to fall asleep
the scene switches over to later in the night where sokka is fast asleep in his bed snoring and drooling on his pillow as it fades to the morning he is lying sideways next to the bed though still fast asleep cut to a closeup of his face as a shadow approaches him he slowly awakens rubbing his eye
offcamera wakey wakey cuts to shot of the innkeeper standing brightly over him time to go shopping
katara appears by her side dressed and happily smiling the camera shifts counterclockwise showing sokka later in the day dressed in his ordinary clothes standing in the marketplace where hama has just made her purchase a friendly old man smiles and waves to her as she walks away
that mr yao seems to have a thing for you maybe we should go back and see if hell give us some free komodo sausages
seriously you would have me use my feminine charms to take advantage of that poor man cheerfully i think you and i are going to get along swimmingly
the two walk off camera with katara smiling at this remark the scene switches over to two villagers having a conversation by a stand
you wont have any ash bananas till next week
well i have to send the boy to hing wa island to get them and its a twoday trip
oh right tomorrows the full moon
in a lowered voice exactly i cant lose another delivery boy in the woods
cuts to shot of aang sokka and toph walking through the marketplace aang carrying a package slung over his shoulder sokka carrying a package attached to his sword while toph carries a large round basket on her head
people disappearing in the woods weird stuff happening during full moons this just reeks of spirit world shenanigans
i bet if we take a little walk around town well find out what these people did to the environment to make the spirits mad
makes gesture with his hand and then you can sew up this little mystery licketysplit avatar style
proudly helping people  thats what i do
cuts to overhead shot of the group standing in the marketplace as he sokka and toph approach katara and hama
why dont you take all those things back to the inn i just have to run a couple more errands ill be back in a little while
walks up to her this is a mysterious little town you have here
extremely closeup ominously mysterious town for mysterious children
she smiles creepily and saunters away leaving sokka feeling suspicious the scene changes to a shot of hamas inn starting outside before moving inside where the gang is unpacking groceries sokka walks over to a counter and sets his basket down
that hama seems a little strange like she knows something or shes hiding something
unpacking items thats ridiculous shes a nice woman who took us in and gave us a place to stay picks up cabbage she kinda reminds me of grangran
but what did she mean by that comment mysterious children
gee i dont know maybe because she found four strange kids camping in the woods at night isnt that a little mysterious
im gonna take a look around walks away and up a flight of wooden stairs
appears along with the others at the bottom of the stairwell sokka sokka what are you doing offcamera as sokka peers around the inn you cant just snoop around someones house
itll be fine
offcamera while sokka peers into a room she could be home any minute
walking down hallway with the rest of the team sokka youre gonna get us all in trouble and this is just plain rude
tugging on a cupboard door im not finished yet grunts as he tries to pull it free come on 
the cupboard suddenly opens revealing several wooden puppets stowed inside the dolls fall forward held together only by their strings everyone gasps sokka withdraws his sword backs up and points it straight at the puppets
okay thats pretty creepy
walks over and closes the cupboard a bit weirded out so shes got a hobby theres nothing weird about that angrily sokka youve looked enough offcamera as sokka ascends into the attic hama will be back soon
just an ordinary puppetloving innkeeper huh well then why does she have a locked door up here
annoyed probably to keep people like you from snooping through her stuff
well see peers through the keyhole into the room cuts to shot of the attic from his perspective through the keyhole a small room can be seen with a chest lying on the ground in the middle the camera zooms in on the chest its empty except for a little chest
maybe its treasure
sokka grows excited his eyes growing wide and uses his sword to pick the lock
approaches him sokka what are you doing youre breaking into a private room
i have to see whats in there
the door unlocks and creaks open the four step cautiously inside sokka puts away his sword and approaches the small chest
we shouldnt be doing this
sokka picks up the chest and tries to pry it open only to discover it is locked
maybe theres a key here somewhere 
ooh hand it over
she takes the chest removes her meteor bracelet from her arm and earthbends it into the shape of a small key which she sticks into the keyhole of the chest
eagerly come on come on
annoyed katara appears from behind her peering nervously over her shoulder this isnt as easy as it looks
nervously guys i dont know about this 
this is crazy im leaving
suit yourself do it toph
katara turns to leave the moment toph signals that she has successfully opened the chest holding her thumb up all four eagerly surround the box in a comical fashion anticipating what they will find inside
offcamera from behind them ill tell you whats in the box
all except toph scream and turn sharply to find hama standing in the doorway cuts to shot of the group still looking stunned except toph sokka guiltily hands her the box cuts to shot from inside the chest as hama lifts the lid and reaches her hand inside cuts to closeup of sokka his eyes wide in anxiousness and a shot of hama still in the process of lifting the object cuts to shot of the team standing together from her perspective her left arm appears onscreen a blue whale tooth comb in her hand cuts to shot of her holding the comb smiling
surprised an old comb
its my greatest treasure its the last thing i own from growing up in the southern water tribe
the camera zooms in on katara and sokka who stare at her in astonishment
stunned youre from the southern water tribe
sets down comb just like you
how did you know
i heard you talking around your campfire
but why didnt you tell us
i wanted to surprise you i bought all this food today so i could fix you a big water tribe dinner of course i cant get all the ingredients i need here but ocean kumquats are a lot like sea prunes if you stew them long enough
sticking his tongue out in disgust great 
i knew i felt a bond with you right away
and i knew you were keeping a secret so i guess were both right grimaces as katara hits him in the arm but im sorry we were sneaking around
apology accepted turns to the side and motions with her hand now lets get cooking
the scene changes to later that night where aang races from the inn to the barn located toward the back of the property cuts to overhead shot of inside the barn where appa and momo lie the doors creak open and aang steps inside cuts to groundlevel shot of him standing before the bison tossing a cabbagelike vegetable into appas mouth momo dances in front of the bisons face and chitters irritated appa opens his mouth and releases the cabbage which momo grabs the lemur skitters away cuts to shot of hamas kitchen table as she sets down a bowl of soup cuts to shot of the entire room the team and the innkeeper sitting around the table sokka is seen chewing on a food item as hama takes her seat at the head of the table
whispering to toph id steer clear of the sea prunes
i thought they were ocean kumquats
close enough
who wants five flavor soup
all four raise their hands in acceptance hama situates her hands over the bowl and suddenly uses waterbending to summon a globule of soup and fill each of their bowls cuts to shot of the team looking at the spectacle in astonishment the camera panning to the right four streams of soup land gracefully into each of their bowls
delighted youre a waterbender faces hama in delight ive never met another waterbender from our tribe
cuts to sideview of her sadly thats because the fire nation wiped them all out i was the last one 
cuts to shot of sokka and katara katara clasping her hands together an expression of pity on her face
so how did you end up out here
grimly i was stolen from my home
the scene fades to a flashback of a much younger hama peacefully sauntering through her southern water tribe village
voiceover it was over sixty years ago when the raids started
she approaches her friend kanna and they share a laugh before they notice ashen snow falling from the sky the two race to the shores where five fire nation ships are rapidly approaching the tribe five fireballs are launched from trebuchets and strike the village fire nation soldiers swarm the area battling the waterbenders who desperately attempt to fend them off
voiceover they came again and again each time rounding up more of our waterbenders and taking them captive
the battle scene fades to another scene where hama and several other waterbenders use waterbending to capsize a fire nation vessel
voiceover we did our best to hold them off but our numbers dwindled as the raids continued
as she is narrating water tribe civilians who aided in the suspension of the vessel are seen slowly fading signaling their capture by the fire nation the camera rotates around her and zooms out revealing dozens of firebenders surrounding her
voiceover finally i too was captured
the younger hama is seen being led by fire nation soldiers onto one of their naval vessels having now been captured herself
voiceover i was led away in chains the last waterbender of the southern water tribe
a final scene shows her looking out onto her tribes members including her friend kanna in tears as the bow creaks upward the flashback ends now in present time katara is seen walking over to hama and placing her arms around her shoulder comfortingly
they put us in terrible prisons here in the fire nation i was the only one who managed to escape
how did you get away and why did you stay in the fire nation
im sorry its too painful to talk about anymore
we completely understand we lost our mother in a raid
sympathetically oh you poor things
aang and sokka cast their heads down solemnly
i cant tell you what it means to meet you its an honor youre a hero
i never thought id meet another southern waterbender id like to teach you what i know so you can carry on the southern tradition when im gone
yes yes of course to learn about my heritage it would mean everything to me
she bows to her newfound friend who smiles warmly the scene changes to the next day where hama and katara are strolling on the outskirts of hamas village
growing up in the south pole waterbenders are totally at home surrounded by snow and ice and seas but as you probably noticed on your travels that isnt the case wherever you go
i know when we were stranded in the desert i felt like there was almost nothing i could do
stops walking thats why you have to learn to control water wherever it exists
ive even used my own sweat for waterbending
smiling thats very resourceful katara youre thinking like a true master but did you know you could even pull water out of thin air
in a quick movement of her right arm hama uses waterbending to manipulate the water vapor in the air liquefying it and coating her fingertips
you have got to keep an open mind katara the water around her fingertips freezes creating ice claws theres water in places you never think about
she proceeds to fire the small daggers at a nearby tree while katara looks on in amazement
meanwhile aang sokka and toph are wandering about the landscape surrounding the village trying to uncover any signs of disruption that would anger the spirits
this has got to be the nicest natural setting in the fire nation i dont see anything that would make a spirit mad around here
the camera focuses on toph and sokka toph is standing casually near where sokka is deeply inhaling the aroma of a bundle of flowers
maybe the moon spirit just turned mean
angrily the moon spirit is a gentle loving lady she rules the sky with compassion and  lunar goodness
catches sight of a villager walking past excuse me sir can you tell us anything about the spirit thats been stealing people
only one man ever saw it and lived and thats old man ding
where does old man ding live
the scene changes to a field of fire lilies where hama continues to tutor katara in waterbending
wow these flowers are beautiful
theyre called fire lilies they only bloom a few weeks a year but theyre one of my favorite things about living here and like all plants and all living things theyre filled with water
i met a waterbender who lived in a swamp and could control the vines by bending the water inside
you can take it even further
in a sharp swiveling motion she draws water from dozens of the surrounding fire lilies and slices a nearby rock clean through
that was incredible sees the wilted lilies its a shame about the lilies though
theyre just flowers when youre a waterbender in a strange land you do what you must to survive tonight ill teach you the ultimate technique of waterbending it can only be done during the full moon when your bending is at its peak
cautiously but isnt that dangerous i thought people have been disappearing around here during the full moon
oh katara two master waterbenders beneath a full moon begins walking away i dont think we have anything to worry about
the two exit the field the scene fades to later that night where aang sokka and toph are approaching old man ding who is boarding up his windows
old man ding
huh accidentally hammers his thumb ow dang blame it what cant you see im busy got a full moon rising and why does everyone call me that im not that old attempts to lift a wooden plank off the ground but fails to do so sighs well im young at heart
aang approaches and helps ding lift the board
not ready to get snapped up by some moon monster yet at least
proceeds to nail the board to the window frame we wanted to ask you about that
did you get a good look at the spirit that took you
didnt see no spirit just felt something come over me like i was possessed forced me to start walking toward the mountain points to the mountain i tried to fight it but i couldnt control my own limbs it just about had me into a cave up there imitates a walking puppet and i looked up at the moon for what i thought would be my last glimpse of light cuts to shot of the trio sokka quivering in fear but then the sun started to rise and i got control of myself again i just hightailed it away from that mountain as quick as i could
why would a spirit want to take people to a mountain
oh no sokka and aang assume defensive positions i did hear people screaming under the mountain the missing villagers must still be there
they all stare at the mountain the scene changes to where aang sokka and toph are racing through the dark forest in search of the imprisoned villagers
feels the ground with her hand i can hear them theyre this way
the trio proceeds to sprint toward the mountain meanwhile hama and katara venture into the moonlit forest
can you feel the power the full moon brings
she inhales deeply through her nose and stretches her arms outward flexing her limbs which causes her veins to bulge out while katara looks on in disgust
for generations it has blessed waterbenders with its glow allowing us to do incredible things
the camera depicts a shot of her standing beneath the full moon
extreme closeup in a sinister tone ive never felt more alive
the scene changes to aang sokka and toph who have arrived at the mountain and are standing before the mouth of the cave
this is the place
i cant see anything down there
grabs sokkas hand thats why you have me lets go
the three descend into the dark cave and approach a solid metal door torches nearby using metalbending toph breaks it down while the trio proceeds to make their way through the tunnel aang and sokka lighting their path with the torches they arrive to see several villagers chained to the walls of the cave
were saved
toph unfastens her meteor bracelet and begins to unlock the prisoners shackles
i didnt know spirits made prisons like this who brought you here
it was no spirit
it was a witch
a witch what do you mean
speaking as toph unlocks her shackles she seems like a normal old woman but she controls people like some dark puppetmaster
gritting hama
yes the innkeeper
i knew there was something creepy about her
we have to stop hama
ill get these people out of here you go
aang and sokka flee from the scene while toph stays behind the scene switches to the forest a cat owl hoots and flies away the camera focuses on hama and katara their backs facing the camera the wind blowing their hair slightly looking toward the moon
what im about to show you cuts to closeup of hama glaring menacingly i discovered in that wretched fire nation prison
the scene fades to a flashback of a younger hama imprisoned within a cage she peers through the bars of her cell and looks down mournfully the camera zooms out to the entire prison room
voiceover the guards were always very careful to keep any water away from us they piped in dry air and had us suspended away from the ground before giving us any water they would bind our hands and feet so we couldnt bend a sideview is shown of fire nation guards giving water to a tied up prisoner any sign of trouble was met with cruel retribution cuts to shot of the full moon in the sky during present day and yet each month i felt the full moon enriching me with its energy cuts to shot of hama there had to be something i could do to escape scene fades to flashback of the prison then i realized that where there is life there is water a younger hama is shown bending the water inside an elephant rat that had wandered its way into her cage the rats that scurried across the floor of my cage were nothing more than skins filled with liquid and i passed years developing the skill that would lead to my escape a closeup is shown of hama smiling at her discovery the scene fades back to present day ominously bloodbending cut to a scared katara controlling the water in another body cut to ground shot of both hama and katara enforcing your own will over theirs the scene fades back to a flashback of young hama controlling a horde of rats using bloodbending once i had mastered the rats i was ready for the men
the camera switches over to show a fire nation guard strolling past the cages when a sudden feeling comes over him using bloodbending hama forces the guard to grab hold of his keys and unlock her cell thus marking her escape
voiceover and during the next full moon i walked free for the first time in decades the guard attempts to get up but hama quickly forces him back down to the ground she walks unsteadily away my cell unlocked by the very guards assigned to keep me in scene changes back to present day camera focuses on a closeup of hama once you perfect this technique you can control anything or looks at katara from the corner of her eyes sadistically anyone
unsure but  to reach inside someone and control them casts unsure glance off to the side i dont know if i want that kind of power
camera zooms out to the two standing in the forest the choice is not yours the power exists and its your duty to use the gifts youve been given to win this war closes up to hama katara they tried to wipe us out our entire culture your mother
closeup of her face i know
camera changes back to hama then you should understand what im talking about were the last two waterbenders of the southern tribe camera focuses on katara offcamera we have to fight these people whenever we can wherever they are with any means necessary
widens eyes in realization its you  angrily youre the one whos been making people disappear during the full moons
closeup of her face as she tilts her head downward they threw me in prison to rot along with my brothers and sisters they deserve the same you must carry on my work
points to hama stretching out her left hand i wont i wont use bloodbending and i wont allow you to keep terrorizing this town her hand suddenly twists to one side she tries desperately to stop it but fails to do so
now using bloodbending to subdue to her you shouldve learned the technique before you turned against me forces katara into a strained position its impossible to fight your way out of my grip i control every muscle every vein in your body
with swift motions of her hands and arms hama uses bloodbending to twist katara around and throw her from side to side she positions katara directly before her and uses a downward motion of her hand to force her into a submissive state
tearfully stop please 
hama laughs cruelly and keeps katara subdued the shot is showing the full moon slowly fades to a closeup of kataras face as she is crying several moments pass as the young waterbender begins to break free from hamas grip hama stares in shock as katara inhales deeply and rises now free from her grasp
determined youre not the only one who draws power from the moon assumes a fighting stance my bending is more powerful than yours hama your technique is useless on me
a waterbending duel ensues between the two katara pulls a ring of water around her waist and sends the stream of water at hama who halts it and sends it back to katara in a swift spinning motion katara sends the stream toward hama again who draws water from nearby trees deflects the attack and sends a highly pressurized water jet at her katara uses her hands to block the attack disintegrating the water into droplets upon seeing kataras bending prowess hama becomes shocked allowing for her opponent to use waterbending to knock her to the ground
shouts aahhh
sokka and aang approach the scene as hama rises to her knees
we know what youve been doing hama
give up takes a fighting stance youre outnumbered
no rising youve outnumbered yourselves
she begins bloodbending aang and sokka who yell in fear and sends them in kataras direction katara pushes them out of her way and draws water from the ground sending a stream at hama who in turn draws water from a vine and uses a water wheel to deflect the attack
unwillingly draws his sword katara look out forced to walk like a puppet while waving the blade back and forth rapidly its like my brain has a mind of its own stop it arm stop it
katara pulls up a ring of water and pushes sokka away
this feels weird
using waterbending to freeze him to a nearby tree im sorry aang
its okay
she catches sight of sokka still under hamas power unwillingly prepared to strike her with his sword she draws water from a vine and freezes his sword and hand to a tree as well
sinisterly dont hurt your friends katara and dont let them hurt each other
she uses bloodbending to break aang and sokka free from their ice encasement and send them colliding straight into one another with sokkas sword pointing straight at aang
horrified no
aang and sokka abruptly halt in their tracks and look at their hands in confusion the camera focuses in on hama who has suddenly stiffened and cuts to katara an unsure look on her face as she uses bloodbending to subdue the elder focusing first on hama who grunts in discomfort the camera turns to show the imprisoned villagers and toph approaching the scene before cutting to moments later when the elderly waterbender is arrested handcuffs placed around her wrists
youre going to be locked away forever
my work is done turns to katara congratulations katara youre a bloodbender
the camera focuses on katara who is clearly distressed and breaks down in tears hama is shown laughing evilly as she is dragged away by the villagers the camera returns to focus on katara who is crying underneath the full moon as aang arm around her and sokka hand on her back attempt to comfort her fades to credits
some koala sheep are sleeping as katara sokka aang toph and appa come out of the bushes sokka looks at a map while everyone else looks around momo jumps over on aangs shoulder as aang scratches his head
somewhat excitedly this is it the official rendezvous point for the invasion force
the camera pans to the left showing a vast area of the place
how did you pick this place
before we split up my dad and i found this island on the map its uninhabited and the harbors surrounded by the cliffs seemed like the perfect secluded place
nice choice sokka and were here four days ahead of schedule
anxiously wait four days the invasions in four days
yawns whatever thats like four days from now lets just calm down and
sokka falls asleep and begins snoring
sokkas got the right idea aang were here were ready the best thing we can do now is get plenty of rest lies down
halfheartedly i guess
everyone else falls asleep aang lies down and as he closes his eyes the camera zooms in on his face
scene briefly fades to black before changing to a large fire nation insignia which is revealed to be a door when the camera zooms back the door busts open revealing a boy with large hair a headband and a yellow jump suit with his face turned the other side he enters the room with a series of dramatic gestures it is revealed that this boy is aang in strange attire aang quickly jumps on to a rock tower cut to wider shot of aang standing on the rock tower surrounded by floating broken pillars
he makes some fast and dramatic ninjalike moves as he speaks your days of tyranny are over fire lord im bringing you down
cut to closeup of the fire lord who is about to take a bite of a bundle of grapes with his eyes closed hearing aangs words he stops and opens his eyes to look down at his adversary the camera pans out quickly to reveal he is actually a giant when compared to aang and surrounded by a pit of fire
really brings his face close to aang how do you plan on doing that when youre not even wearing pants
cut to aangs scared face as he looks down to see that ozai was telling the truth and screams
oh no
aang quickly covers himself with a white air nomad shield pulled out of thin air the camera zooms out to a larger shot of aang shaking with embarrassment suddenly giant eyes begin to appear all around him the eyes close and disappear cut to shot of the giant fire lord laughing as aang slowly backs out the door the fire lord raises his arms to the ceiling while surrounded by flames laughing heartily aang wakes up and starts touching his pants momo is seen awake as well
it was just a dream momo i still have my pants stands up well i better keep training
aang walks over to a bush and starts kicking it momo gets bored of watching him and soon falls back asleep scene changes to the fire nation palace where zuko is getting dressed and ready with help from his servants
fresh fruit prince zuko
zuko puts out his hand and shakes his head respectfully
may i wash your feet sir
zuko respectfully puts his hand out and shakes his head again
head massage
zuko shakes his head again
hot towel
zuko looks at the towels for a moment and takes one he is seen wiping his forehead before walking out of the room the two servants bow behind him zuko walks out the palace gates with fire nation citizens waiting for him one woman becomes overly excited at seeing zuko and is taken away by the palace guards
prince zuko is something wrong you didnt take the palanquin
im just going to mais house its not far
its not a princes place to walk anywhere sir
zuko looks to the distance walks over and gets into the palanquin the servants pick it up and walk over to mais house zuko looks out of the palanquins curtains and sees mai who is standing by the doors to her house who waves and walks away
the scene changes back to aang who is still training he is now banging his fists against a tree which wakes up sokka toph and katara katara looks at sokka who just shrugs she decides to go talk to aang about this
hey how long have you been up
a couple hours i got a lot more skills to refine if im gonna fight ozai
aang stops panting you know there is such a thing as overtraining
aang hits the tree one last time which sends a vibration throughout his body and makes him fall down with all of the leaves off the tree collapsing on him katara just gazes down at him and sokka holding his map and toph who is facing the other direction look out from behind her aang comes out from under the leaves and walks around katara in a fighting stance

aangs left eye twitches a little bit after saying this katara brings aangs hand down with a forced smile on her face sokka is seen lying down still looking at the map
thats okay aang the eclipse will block off firebending anyway you dont need to know it looking at aang plus its a stupid element
okay well i still have to work on everything else i better spend the whole day training
aang bows quickly toward sokka followed by katara and rides off on an air scooter sokka moves the map up in front of his face to hide behind it the view changes to the blue sky which changes to a starry night aang is walking back from his training now exhausted everyone else is asleep aang rubs his eyes and yawns before collapsing
wide shot of the group on the cliffside with the camera slowly zooming out good night katara good night sokka good night toph good night appa good night momo good night appa and mo

cut to aang who flinched upon hearing toph but goes back into his normal position and closes his eyes the camera pans up
the scene fades briefly to black again before cutting to shot of aang busting through the same large fire nation door from his previous dream this time he is wearing boats white pants a high collared yellow tunic that covers his mouth white sleeves with blue arrows on them and has his chest wrapped in a chain he has sideburns his hair is long and stands up straight wears his headband and has two small metal rings in the top of his right ear as he stands in the opening where the doors once were he snaps his fingers and smoke starts to pour into the entrance aang slides in and jumps over some small pillars to face ozai who is still a giant
frontal shot as he points outward your days of tyranny are over fire lord scowls im bringing you down looks down momentarily confidently and this time i brought pants
camera shows a view of some chains wrapping around aangs clothing including his pants the shot turns to ozai
so it seems but are you prepared for your  mathematics test
a giant abacus lands behind aang camera turns to show aangs worried face
math test oh no i forgot all about the math test
ozai is heard laughing in the background as aang is screaming while being pulled backward and crushed by some beads on the abacus he suddenly wakes up
ive gotta be ready
aang gets up and walks away he is seen pacing around some sleeping koala sheep katara comes over to talk to him
aang its the middle of the night you need to go back to sleep
but i forgot my pants and my math test
katara sighs and grabs aangs shoulder
aang sleep please for me
aang looks at her rubbing his eyes he bows his head and the two walk back a koala sheep makes a sound the scene changes to the royal palace where zuko and mai are relaxing on a couch
tell me if you could have anything you want right now what would it be
hm  a big fancy fruit tart with rose petals on top
you know being a prince and all i might just be able to make that happen
chuckles that would be impressive
to the servants do you think you could find a fresh fruit tart for the lady with rose petals on top
excellent choice sir
i guess theres some nice perks that come with being royalty pushing him zuko to lay down with her though theres annoying stuff too like that allday war meeting coming up
sitting up followed by mai war meeting what are you talking about
azula mentioned something ii assumed you were going too
i guess i wasnt invited
the two look away from each other the scene changes back to the black cliffs where aang is still sleeping
wake up aang wake up sleepy head cut to an out of focus swaying shot of the fire lord standing over aang rise and shine you overslept the fire lord bends in close and then even closer you missed the invasion
ozai begins to laugh and is seen riding a giant flying hippo cow which breathes out fire at aang making him move from his spot he watches as ozai flies away still laughing aang quickly wakes up and goes to wake up sokka
sokka get up i needa know what day it is
what whos talking
sokka grabs his sword and jumps up but hits his head on a nearby rock and falls down toph and katara are seen waking up
relax its still two days before the invasion
aang begins pulling on sokkas legs trying to get him up
sokka youve gotta get up drill your rockclimbing exercises
what
in one of my dreams you were running from fire nation soldiers trying to climb this cliff camera turns to show an annoyed look on sokkas face but you were too slow and they got you
sokka stands up quickly and steps in front of aang
but that was just a dream im a great climber
while pointing at the cliff nearby then climb that cliff climb it fast
camera turns to show the size of the cliff when it sets back on sokka he looks at aang pointing to the cliff aang nods fast and sokka reluctantly begins to climb it
stupid avatar stupid cliff stupid dream i can climb fast
aang is seen looking up at sokka with an anxious smile before frowning at seeing how slowly he was going toph tries to get a drink of water
turning around to her dont drink that
sokka is seen behind aang falling off the cliff after hearing aang toph spits out the water onto katara who waterbends it off her
why is it poisoned
in my dream we were right in the middle of the invasion and you had to stop to use the bathroom he puts his hands between his legs and squeezes them together we died because of your tiny bladder he turns to katara and you need to start wearing your hair up in my dream your hair got caught in a train and
putting a hand on the side of his face aang i know youre just trying to help but you really need to get a grip youre unraveling
he takes a deep breath before finally speaking youre right im losing my mind
sokka is still climbing the cliff and almost reaches the top but is seen sliding down cut to the sun in the sky cut to aangs face his eye twitching as he paces around stressed cut to his hands rotating between putting his thumb and finger together before alternating to the opposites on the other hand
its like every time i think about how stressed i am i just end up more stressed im like a big growing snowball of nerves
as he paces katara sits concerned petting momo and watching aang while sokka hammers away at a piece of armor for appa toph lies resting against a sleeping appa
turning to look at aang of course you are thats cause you gotta fight the fire lord the baddest man on the planet and you better win or were all done for
approaching sokka annoyed sokka youre not helping
standing what its true thats the deal he knows it
katara pushes down sokka to sit before looking over at aang who is nervously shaking she walks over to him and touches his shoulders
you know what ive got just the thing get ready to be destressified
scene changes to aang and katara in a mountain doing some yoga steaming water in the middle of the room
these yoga stretches can really work wonders if you do them in extreme heat reach up katara puts her hands above her head together aang follows along reach for the sun they wave their hands and upper bodies side to side feel your chi paths clearing both bend over so their heads touch the ground grabbing their legs now close your eyes how are you feeling
closeup of aang sweating i feel  really warm
good good go on
like theres this warm feeling all around me this heat becoming frantic again like im in the fire lords palace and hes shooting a bunch of fireballs at me and the whole world is being engulfed in flames
an orange flame is seen circling around covering the view before disappearing aang gets out of his position and lands on his back panting
maybe your stress is the kind you need to talk out
scene changes to sokka in his wang fire outfit and aang lying on a koala sheep
in his wang fire voice why dont you get right down to business and tell me whats been bothering you
you know whats bothering me i have to fight the fire lord in a few days
he nods upon hearing aangs explanation tell me more about this fire lord why are you so afraid of him
you said it yourself hes the baddest man on the planet im supposed to defeat him and save the world
nodding in agreement life does feel that way sometimes doesnt it like were all trying to save the world from evil
okay but what can i do to feel better
while handing aang a koala sheep want to try screaming into this pillow
aang does so once his face is out of the wool the koala sheep makes a noise at him after sokka scratches his head he does a thumbsup while nodding aang shakes his head so sokka nods faster but aang shakes his head faster scene changes to azula at the royal spa getting her hair done zuko comes in and walks up to her
hello zuzu if youve come for a royal haircombing im afraid youll have to wait
so i guess theres a big war meeting coming up huh and apparently im not welcome there
what do you mean of course youre welcome there

oh zuko dont be so dramatic im certain dad wants you there you probably just werent invited because its so obvious youre supposed to be there
well were you invited
of course im the princess
and im the prince
exactly so stop acting like a paranoid child just go to the meeting
forget it im not going
zuko turns around and walks away the scene changes to aang lying down on some pillars
all right what you need is a good oldfashioned back pounding to relieve your stress
looking up at her pound away
toph begins stomping fiercely causing the pillars to move up and down in various order
the pillars causing him pain ow toph  i  think  this  is  bruising  me
toph stops and aang begins sliding to the left off the pillars
sorry i forgot you had baby skin aang grabs onto the edge of the pillars and gets up well theres one other thing we can try she stomps the ground sending a distant boarqpine to her she catches it and holds it out to aang with a wide grin acupuncture
the boarqpines quills stick out and aang runs away scene changes back to the fire nation palace where zuko is looking out a window mai comes up to him
zuko its just a dumb meeting who cares
i dont
well good you shouldnt i mean why would you even want to go just think about how things went the last meeting you went to
sighs i know
you know what will make you feel better zuko turns his head slightly ordering some servants around i might be hungry for a whole tray of fruit tarts and maybe a little palanquin ride around town double time
she turns zukos face to look at her but he quickly looks away making mai let go of him scene changes back to the black cliffs aang is sitting up holding his knees
thanks for everything guys
so do you feel less stressed ready for a good nights sleep
he turns his head away uh i kinda think i sorta might slightly feel a little better he looks back at his friends maybe
then our work here is done
sokka katara and toph stretch and yawn before lying down aang slowly lies down and closes his eyes leading to another dream it begins with a thunderstorm with aang riding on appa through it they fly by a giant momo who tries hitting them down and grabs them in his hand it changes to an image of the fire nation royal palace and aang emerges in the water and is pushed forward into the palace he looks in all directions waiting for something to happen toph is seen rotating around her bangs move to reveal that her eyes are blank she falls down under the floor in front of aang who becomes scared sokka tries running away but some wet earth closes around him katara is seen surrounded by fire aang tries to go save her but his feet are frozen to the ground ice crawls up his body and he reaches out but hes completely frozen the ground that he was on becomes completely ice ozai as a fire monster begins laughing and melts the ice which makes aang fall down he is released from his form and falls into some water where he sinks to the bottom and looks through the floor seeing zuko as if he was standing above the comet is seen passing by behind zuko aang is seen still holding his breath the comet is shown rushing down momo is seen telling someone to be quiet aang is standing on grass and seeing bushes and mountains when the comet strikes the ground and everything is scorched and on fire he quickly wakes up screaming and waking everyone else up appa becomes scared and momo slides off him everyone rushes over to him
what happened aang
turns away on hands and knees its the nightmares they just get worse and worse
looks like its time for another  he turns around and puts his wang fire disguise on and voice therapy session
momentarily looking back no that wont help nothing helps theres only one thing i can do im going to stay awake straight through to the invasion
aang starts shaking upon this and everyone behind him is shocked except for toph who just smiles sokkas wang fire disguise falls off him the scene changes to the next day where katara is doing some exercises on the edge of the cliff aang is pacing nervously behind her which makes her stop
invasion all aboard for the invasion
approaching you dont look so good you sure you cant just lie down for a little nap
i told you i cant go back to sleep
aang staying up all night cant be good for you
walking toward the cliff edge katara turns and moves a bit to follow actually staying up all night has given me some time to think and ive realized some big things katara
what big things
i see everything so clearly now what really matters why im really doing this he turns around to look at katara im doing it to save the world but more than that im doing it for the people i love side shot of aang and katara near each other im doing it for you katara
aang what are you saying
im saying i love you he kisses her after he pulls back she embraces and kisses him back
after kissing for a while she pulls back whispering slightly what are we doing
what our hearts have been telling us to do for a long long time baby he moves katara down to the side youre my forever girl aang puckers up his lips for another kiss
aang aang realizes he was just daydreaming and realizes he is not holding katara anymore i was just saying you should take a nap
he quickly turns around to face katara oh i guess i kinda drifted off into a daydream
what was your dream about
he pauses to think for a moment uh living underwater
initially confused she smiles back sounds neat
aang nervously laughs katara walks away and he lets out a sigh of relief the scene changes back to mais house zuko is lying down on the arm of the couch while mai is making tea just as she is about to give him a cup someone calls for him
prince zuko he bows before the prince everyones waiting for you
mai and zuko walk over to the servant to see what hes talking about
what
the high admirals the high generals the war ministers and the princess have all arrived youre the only person missing
so my dad wants me at the meeting
the fire lord said he would not start until you arrived sir
zuko smiles and looks at mai who is also smiling the scene changes back to the black cliffs where aang is hiding behind a bush in his fire nation uniform he jumps out and rolls behind a rock before stepping up from behind the rock
put em up fire lord
aang jumps out from behind the rock and starts shooting air blasts at the noodle picture of fire lord ozai tied to a tree one of the shots goes too far and hits sokka who is working on a golden arrow
hey im tryin build appa some armor here so he doesnt have to go into the invasion naked hes your bison
standing in front of the ozai tree in a fighting stance ozais defense is impeccable ill have to try a different approach
aang jumps up and shoots more air blasts but they all miss aang lands on his feet and looks at the picture only a leaf falls aang runs up in front of the picture
you think youre untouchable dont you mr fire lord
offscreen boy you are really starting to lose it kid
aang quickly becomes surprised upon hearing the voice and quickly turns around to face momo
momo did you hear something turns back
offscreen no but i said something aang becomes shocked and gets close to momo you my friend are just a few plums short of a fruit pie aang stares at momo in disbelief his jaw wide open he quickly stands up shakes his head and covers his eyes he peeks through them at which point momo begins chittering normally again aang walks up to him and pets him
thats more like it im so tired that for a second there i imagined you were talking to me momo tilts his head in confusion everyone is seen walking forward and watching aang oh momo let me explain aang begins chattering like momo katara and sokka share a look of confusion as toph merely stands there with a slightly annoyed look momo chitters back in which aang laughs before chittering again katara interrupts him
aang were all starting to get a little worried about you
youve been awake too long
and youre acting downright weird
youve got to take care of yourself you cant go on like this
sighs look i appreciate what you guys are saying but the stress and the nightmares they were just too much staying awake is the best way for me to deal with it
standing and pointing at appa yeah leave the kid alone
pointing back hey who asked you the two begin to fight

no i am sick of this guy always mouthing me and telling me what to do
oh you dont like it well lets go right now
aang runs over to sokka for help not realizing that his friends dont see anything

the view goes outside where it is seen that the palace is up on a rock in the sky the scene fades back to the black cliffs with ozai screaming to aang who is seen smiling upon his success in the dream fade to credits
the episode starts in the black cliffs with the scene cutting to a shot of three maps lying splayed out on the ground cut to sokka who ponders over the maps intensely he closes his eyes and rubs his forehead seemingly confused two gloved hands suddenly appear one holding a cup and the other moving sokkas hand aside from his forehead to hand him the cup the hand comes to rest on his shoulders comfortingly cut to zoomed out shot of sokka sitting by a cliffedge the maps laid out before him katara is kneeling right beside him having been the one to hand him the cup toph can be seen in the background sitting idly on a rock aang suddenly appears onscreen leaping into the air and landing beside toph

excuse me the boulder is confused isnt the point to invade during the eclipse when the firebenders are powerless
the eclipse only lasts eight minutes not enough time for the whole invasion and the royal palace is heavily guarded by firebenders so thats where well need the eclipses advantage the most when this is finished the avatar will have defeated the fire lord we will have control of the fire nation capital and this war will be over
the entire crowd cheers and sokka looks dismayed

the invasion plan was my moment of truth and i completely flubbed it i just fell apart
approaches putting a hand on his shoulder sokka that speech wasnt your moment of truth that was just public speaking and nobodys really good at that
my dad is he explained the plan perfectly and inspired everyone like a real leader should

brightening dad rising and approaching the two youre on your feet again
sitting down somewhat weakly thanks to your sister im in no shape to fight but maybe theres some way i can help
everythings going smoothly and the eclipse hasnt even kicked in yet
katara moves away sensing something in the distance lets hope our luck holds out noticing her move away katara you seem distracted is something wrong
quizzically yeah is that  is that aang
shocked what cuts to shot of aang riding in on his glider dodging several fireballs he lands in front of the group please tell me youre here because the fire lord turned out to be a big wimp and you didnt even need the eclipse to take him down
katara and aang kneel with sokka he wasnt home no one was the entire palace city is abandoned
with epiphany the camera shifts from a sideview of his face to a frontal view they knew
cuts to overhead shot of the group sitting together in a circle aang rubs his fingers along the ground idly
dismayed its over the fire lord is probably longgone far away on some remote island where hell be safe during the eclipse
thoughtfully no my instincts tell me he wouldnt go too far he would have a secret bunker somewhere he could go and be safe during the siege but still be close enough to lead his nation
if its an underground secret bunker were looking for points to herself im just the girl to find it
pulling out mechanism the mechanist gave me this timing device it looks like weve got about ten minutes until the full eclipse ten minutes to find the fire lord
we can still do this we can still win the day
worried wait if they knew we were coming it could all be a trap looks at the others the camera pans to the right maybe we should use the time we have left to make sure we all get out of here safely
everyone whos here today came prepared to risk everything for this mission they know whats at stake if theres still a chance and theres still hope i think they would want aang to go for it
to aang what do you think youre the one that has to face the fire lord whatever you decide im with you
rising turning his back to the group determined ive gotta try
the scene changes to where aang toph and sokka are flying on appa to the caldera volcano in the fire nation appa lands on the side as the others jump off
do you feel anything down there
placing her hand on the ground to feel vibrations yep there are natural tunnels crisscrossing through the inside of the volcano
anything else is there a structure somewhere
taking her hands and digging her fingers into the surface there is something big dense and made of metal deep in the heart of the volcano
raises arms up in the background sounds like a secret bunker to me
toph earthbends a hole in the volcano blowing up a cloud of dust sokka follows her into the tunnel
to appa and momo stay safe well be back soon
he enters the tunnel into a dark cavern with toph leaning over and surveying the area using seismic sense
pointing this way that ones a dead end
following her what would we do without you
camera view changes to show the group walking past magma channels perish in burning hot magma
observing the magma channels blushing yeah pretty much
they arrive at a chamber where magma erupts from several spouts in the ground
the tunnel continues on the other side and it leads right to the bunker
well have to be fast but careful
he begins walking past only for a geyser of magma to erupt nearly striking him aang uses airbending to cool and solidify the gush
how is that careful
i was wrong we need to be fast careful and lucky
the three leap and run their way through the chamber narrowly avoiding magma spouts they arrive to a rock ledge completely surrounded by molten lava
theres no floor its just a river of lava
spinning his staff open climb aboard and hold on tight
scene changes to where sokka and toph screaming in fear are clinging to aangs glider for their life as they ride swiftly over the river of lava they reach the other side safely and approach a large metal domelike structure with a huge door
impressed thats some door
walks over to the door and bangs the metal with her fist not a problem
she uses metalbending jamming into the door with her elbows creating cracks in the metal she steps back several feet kisses her fingertips and splits the door wide open stepping inside the interior she points in a direction
entering the bunker while making some hand movements i am so glad we added you to the group
back at the invasion the fire nation is beginning to fall back unsuccessfully trying to deflect the attacks of the invasion force the boulder and the hippo use earthbending to create landslides that collapse several battlements
witnessing the sun as the moon begins to overshadow it retreat everyone move to the secondary defensive position retreat
the fire nation soldiers halt their attacks and begin escaping the scene
standing from the side of an earth kingdom tank the eclipse is only minutes away we should be able to make it up to hill by the time it starts and secure the entire palace by the time its finished
the troops cheer gruffly and continue on their way to the capital
stopping with her father we can wait here if you want
determined no i wanna press forward with the others
the two resume walking the scene changes to aang toph and sokka running down the tunnels qin is coming down the same hallway whistling the team upon seeing him immediately corners him prepared to attack
out of fear the fire lords chamber is that way down the hall to the left makes climbing motions with his fingers and up the stairs you cant miss it
suspicious look suddenly becomes friendly thanks
the trio continues on their way to find the fire lord qin relaxes himself does a few double takes and continues whistling as if nothing happened before walking away the group continues running sokka pulls out his timing device

first of all in ba sing se it was azula who took down the avatar not me
why would she lie to me about that
because the avatars not dead he survived
shocked and horrified what

rises from his seat and points toward the door get out get out of my sight right now if you know whats good for you
thats another thing im not taking orders from you anymore

scornful it was to teach you respect
it was cruel and it was wrong
angrily then you have learned nothing
no ive learned everything and ive had to learn it on my own growing up we were taught that the fire nation was the greatest civilization in history and somehow the war was our way of sharing our greatness with the rest of the world what an amazing lie that was the people of the world are terrified by the fire nation they dont see our greatness they hate us and we deserve it camera view shows top profile of zuko and ozai through an overhead grate weve created an era of fear in the world and if we dont want the world to destroy itself cuts to shot of zuko we need to replace it with an era of peace and kindness
laughs your uncle has gotten to you hasnt he
yes smiles proudly he has
ozai only grows more furious the scene changes to where team avatar is fighting azula and her dai li agents aang bursts through the stone wall the agents had created and the team runs toward the fire nation princess a stone column erupts from the surface which aang manages to dodge toph bends two stone slabs sending the agents toward the two sidewalls of the room the agents each land on one sidewall and send two earth pillars straight at toph who conjures two earth walls to block their attacks she proceeds to send a stream of earth at azula who nimbly backflips onto the throne after being pushed back by the stream she smirks as she lands
aang races toward her an agent following close behind he looks up to catch sight of the agent rocketing along a wall the agent lands before him and builds up an earth wall which aang breaks through he sends an air blast at azula who manages to slip away as the blast destroys the throne aang attempts the knock her down by sending an air swipe however azula avoids his attack acutely leaping and flipping between two metal beams she lands on the ground deftly and continues running away
the camera focuses on the princess as she leaps from one metal beam to the other aang sends another air swipe at her only to miss her yet again azula slides down a stone pillar created earlier by a dai li agent she flips onto one of the stone walls toph conjured up to protect herself before and jumps onto the other one before landing on the ground again she begins running toward a stone wall a dai li agent slides down a stone column to the floor where he launches azula into the air by bending an earth pillar below her feet the camera cuts to sokka as he climbs his way through the hole in the stone wall played out in slowmotion azula is seen leaping through the wall hovering mere inches over sokkas face smiling evilly at him as she passes she lands onto the ground and begins running again
cuts to sokka who dodges again to avoid a dai li agent aang and toph who each leap through the hole one after the other sokka lands to the ground and follows the group cuts to where aang and toph are running side by side
while running i cant pin her down shes too quick
azula races through a door entering a tunnel a dai li agent follows close behind earthbending a stone wall to block the entranceway he proceeds to run after the princess aang bursts the wall and chases them the dai li agent is suddenly pushed over by a stone column that jutted out from the side of tunnels wall a hole appears and toph emerges from it the agent lands into a crevice of a nearby metal beam and prepares to attack toph only for the blind earthbender to destroy his rock gloves and metalbend the grooves of the beam together trapping him she and aang continue chasing azula sokka quickly runs up to them
stops running wait aang toph stop attacking dont you see what shes doing shes just playing with us shes not even trying to win this fight
calmly not true im giving it my all
angrily youre trying to keep us here and waste all our time
sarcastically um right i think your friend just said that genius and since you cant see i should tell you im rolling my eyes rolls her eyes in disgust
angrily ill roll your whole head
shes just baiting you again
okay so what do we do just ignore her
we dont have a choice we just have to get out of here and find the fire lord on our own somehow
the trio turns to leave walking toward the opposite end of the tunnel
coolly its a trap dont say i didnt warn you
aang and toph stop walking and turn to look at the princess both appearing hesitant sokka continues to walk forward
waves hand up in gesture ignore
craftily so sokkas your name right my favorite prisoner used to mention you all the time sokka stops walking and casts azula a suspicious glance she was convinced you were going to come rescue her of course you never came and she gave up on you
sokka sheds a few tears before charging at azula in blind rage the princess stands perfectly still
evilly to herself come and get it
with a quick motion of her left hand she reveals a hidden dagger prepared to strike sokka when he comes within range toph senses the weapon and pins azulas hand to the tunnel wall by sending a rock aimed at her wrist sokka grabs her by the shoulder coming facetoface with her
where is suki
the scene changes to zuko and ozai
after i leave here today im gonna free uncle iroh from his prison and im gonna beg for his forgiveness cuts to shot of ozai hes the one whos been a real father to me
laughs oh thats just beautiful and maybe he can pass down to you the ways of tea and failure
but ive come to an even more important decision closes eyes and momentarily pauses im going to join the avatar and im going to help him defeat you
smugly really since youre a fullblown traitor now and you want me gone why wait im powerless youve got your swords why dont you just do it now
because i know my own destiny taking you down is the avatars destiny puts his swords away goodbye
camera focuses on zuko walking away the fire lord in the background now on his feet coward you think youre brave enough to face me but youll only do it during the eclipse if you have any real courage youll stick around until the sun comes out dont you want to know what happened to your mother
zuko abruptly stops and turns to face his father ozai smiles the camera cuts to a shot of outside where the solar eclipse continues cut back to zuko confronting ozai

the camera focuses on azula who grins smugly keeping her lips sealed the shot fades to ozai who continues his account of the night ursa disappeared
your mother did vicious treasonous things that night she knew the consequences and accepted them for her treason she was banished
grows tearyeyed so shes alive
calmly perhaps now i realize that banishment is far too merciful a penalty for treason ozai closes his eyes shot fades to outside where the solar eclipse begins to end your penalty will be far steeper
fade briefly to show the eclipse ending fade to ozai as he opens his eyes and in split seconds generates lightning firing the bolt at zuko zuko slides back several feet from the impact of the bolt yet manages to redirect it sending it back to right in front of his father the resulting explosion causes the fire lord to slam into the back wall where he falls over and raises his head his face distorted in rage as flames from the lightning attack surround him the flag behind him falls and the camera cuts to a shot of the room revealing that zuko had made his escape the scene changes to team avatar
oh sounds like the firebendings back on
she kicks her leg in a wide arc sending a fire blast that nearly strikes sokka sokka takes several steps back as he narrowly avoids azulas attacks she backflips onto the tunnel wall and uses firebending to break free from tophs earth cuffs she flips forward extending her leg forward nearly striking aang who manages to dodge the incoming danger
rises and smirks dads all the way at the end of the hall then down a secret stairway on the left im sure hed be more than happy to see you now
she runs away leaving the trio dismayed
ashamed i fell for it i used up all our time
its not your fault sokka azula was ready for us she had every move planned out
sorrowfully and now its too late
maybe its not too late the eclipse is over but i can face the fire lord anyway
matteroffactly no i dont think thats a good idea
but im ready i came here with a job to do and everyones counting on me

determined first well check each of the air temples then well scour the world searching even the most remote locations until we find him
prince zuko its only been a week since your banishment you should take some time to heal and rest
what else would i expect to hear from the laziest man in the fire nation iroh sighs the only way to regain my honor is to find the avatar so i will
iroh walks away as the flashback ends fading to zuko who looks disappointed in himself zuko notices appa flying nearby and hides quickly he subsequently runs off cut back to team avatar

you guys go i think we need to talk about some things
ill race you duke
i told you its the duke
the three head off cut to katara and aang
why cant i go
we need to decide what were gonna do now and since youre the avatar maybe you should be a part of this
sitting down fair enough so whats the new plan
well if you ask me the new plan is the old plan you just need to master all four elements and confront the fire lord before the comet comes
sarcastically oh yeah thats great no problem ill just do that
aang no one said its going to be easy
well its not even gonna be possible where am i supposed to get a firebending teacher
we could look for jeong jeong
shooting her idea down yeah  right he lays down on the bench without a care like well ever run into jeong jeong again
curiously whos  oh she folds her arms irritably never mind if its important ill find out
oh well guess we cant come up with anybody why dont we just take a nice tour around the temple he and momo fly off
whats up with him
theres gotta be someone who can teach him firebending
katara and toph look down dejectedly as the camera slowly pans up and fades to a smiling zuko in a forested area with his tent
hello  raises an arm in greeting zuko here but i guess rubs his hand against the back of his head nervously you probably already know me sort of uhhh  so the thing is i have a lot of firebending experience and im places an arm on his chest with pride considered to be pretty good at it he continues smiling well youve seen it you know when i was attacking you his eyes widen uhhh  yeah i guess places his fingers against his forehead in embarrassment i should apologize for that but anyway waves an arm to the side dismissively im good now clenches both fists and places one on his chest while the other arm is raised i mean i thought i was good before but i realize i was bad he gets visibly uncomfortable and drops his arms into a slouch but anyway i think its time i joined your group and taught straightens up with a sincere expression on his face the avatar firebending a badgerfrog croaks at him angrily well whats your answer the badgerfrog hops on his head before hopping away yeah  thats what id say too how am i supposed to convince these people that im on their side what would uncle do imitating iroh zuko you have to look within yourself to save yourself from your other self only then will your true self reveal itself normal voice even when im talking for him i cant figure out what he means what would azula do imitating azula listen avatar i can join your group or i can do something unspeakably horrible to you and your friends your choice normal voice stops and sits down i guess im just not that good at impersonations
a badgerfrog jumps in front of him as he sits and croaks meanwhile aang is flying on his glider sokka katara and toph follow him on appa
aang can we talk about you learning firebending now
what the wind is too loud in my ears check out this loop
aang proceeds to do a loop
aang i think we should be making some plans about our future
okay we can do that while i show you the giant pai sho table oh youre gonna love the allday echo chamber
cut to a close up of toph as she turns serious i think thatll have to wait
toph points behind herself and the camera zooms out to show team avatar looking at her quizzically appa moves out of the way to reveal a shadow and as the camera pans up it is revealed to belong to zuko cut to a closeup of the team as they look at him with shocked expressions which subsequently turn into anger
cut to a close up of zukos face hello  raises his arm up in greeting and waves zuko here
the gang prepares to attack
hey i heard you guys flying around down there so i just thought id wait for you here appa growls at him and licks him twice cut to a surprised momo and aang as he lowers his staff slightly i know you must be surprised to see me here
not really since youve followed us all over the world
right well uhhh  anyway  what i wanted to tell you about is that ive changed and i uhhh im good now and well i think i should join your group oh and i can teach firebending to you the gang expresses shock see i uhhh 
you want to what now
you cant possibly think that any of us would trust you can you i mean how stupid do you think we are
yeah all youve ever done is hunt us down and try to capture aang
ive done some good things i mean i could have stolen your bison in ba sing se but i set him free thats something appa licks him again much to his surprise
appa the siblings turn toward her does seem to like him
he probably just covered himself in honey or something so that appa would lick him im not buying it
i can understand why you wouldnt trust me and i know ive made some mistakes in the past
like when you attacked our village
or when you stole my mothers necklace and used it to track us down and capture us
look i admit ive some awful things i was wrong to try to capture you and im sorry that i attacked the water tribe and i never should have sent that fire nation assassin after you toph and sokkas eyes widen with shock im going to try and stop
pulls out his boomerang angrily wait you sent combustion man after us
well thats not his name but
sarcastically ohhh sorry i didnt mean to insult your friend
angrily hes not my friend
that guy locked me and katara in jail and tried to blow us all up
to aang why arent you saying anything you once said you thought we could be friends you know i have good in me
aang turns to look at his friends and sokka shakes his head at aang
theres no way we can trust you after everything youve done well never let you join us
you need to get out of here now
im trying to explain that im not that person anymore
either you leave or we attack
if you wont accept me as a friend then maybe youll take me as a prisoner zuko kneels down bends his head and raises his arms in surrender
no we wont blasts water at him get out of here and dont come back and if we ever see you again well wed better not see you again
zuko walks away cut back to zukos campsite
uggh i cant believe how stupid i am i mean what was i thinking telling them i sent an assassin after them why didnt i just say azula did that they would have believed that stupid a badgerfrog croaks at him uggh
back at the air temple
why would he try to fool us like that
obviously he wants to lead us into some kind of trap
this is just like when we were in prison together at ba sing se he starts talking about his mother and making it seem like hes an actual human being with feelings
he wants you to trust and feel sorry for him so you let your guard down then he strikes
the thing is it worked i did feel sorry for him i felt like he was really confused and hurt but obviously when the time came he made his choice and we paid the price we cant trust him
i kind of have a confession to make remember when you two were sick and i got captured by zhao
and you made us suck on frozen frogs how could i forget i had a wart on the flap that hangs down from the back of my throat for a month
sokka i looked at it and i told you there was nothing there
i could feel it its my throatal flap
anyway when zhao had me chained up it was zuko who came in and got me out he risked his life to save me
no way im sure he only did it so he could capture you himself
yeah face it aang youre nothing but a big prize to him
youre probably right
and what was all that crazy stuff about setting appa free what a liar
actually he wasnt lying
sarcastically oh hooray in a lifetime of evil at least he didnt add animal cruelty to the list
im just saying that considering his messedup family and how he was raised he could have turned out a lot worse
sarcastically youre right toph lets go find him and give him a medal the not as much of a jerk as you could have been award
all i know is that while he was talking to us he was sincere maybe youre all just letting your hurt feelings keep you from thinking clearly
easy for you to say you werent there when he had us attacked by pirates
or when he burned down kyoshi island
or when he tried to capture me at the fire temple
why would you even try to defend him
angrily because katara youre all ignoring one crucial fact pokes aang in the chest aang needs a firebending teacher we cant think of a single person in the world to do the job now one shows up on a silver platter and you wont even think about it stamps her feet on the ground to a point where the ground shakes slightly
im not having zuko as my teacher
youre darn right youre not buddy
well i guess that settles that
ergh im beginning to wonder whos really the blind one around here walks away
nightfall zukos campsite zuko is asleep when he hears something
whos there stay back whips fire
its me throws up an earth shield but steps back into zukos fire blast ow you burned my feet
im sorry it was a mistake comes toward her but she begins to crawl away
get away from me as toph crawls away she grabs the earth under her and throws it backward at zuko
let me help you dodges another rock im sorry tries to grab her
get off me get off me brings up some earth which sends zuko flying back
i didnt know it was you uggh come back toph leaves uggh why am i so bad at being good
the next morning western air temple katara is serving everyone breakfast
handing a bowl to the duke has anyone seen toph
i havent seen her since she stormed off yesterday
maybe shes just exploring the air temple there are some pretty fun spots to practice earthbending
i think we should go look for her
sitting let her have fun with her rocks im in no rush to have her yelling at us again
we can go check for her
has a bandage around his forehead yeah i want to ride that tunnel down to the hall of statues again it will work a lot better now that i fixed my brakes
haru the duke and teo exit
a large rumble occurs toph falls down the pile of rock that she created from a wall
approaching with sokka and aang worried toph what happened
my feet got burned
oh no what happened
i just told you my feet got burned
i meant how
well i kind of went to see zuko last night everyone is shocked
you what
zuko
uhhh 
i thought he could be helpful to us katara begins to try and heal her feet and if i talked to him maybe we could work something out
so he attacked you
well he did and he didnt it was sort of an accident
but he did firebend at you
sighs yes
see you trusted zuko and you got burned literally
its gonna take a while for your feet to get better stops healing i wish i could have worked on them sooner
yeah me too
zukos clearly too dangerous to be left alone were gonna have to go after him
i hate to go looking for a fight but youre right after what he did to toph i dont think we have a choice
hes crafty but well find a way to capture him
maybe just invite him back here aang and sokka go to pick her up hes already offered himself up as a prisoner once
yeah get him to come back and say hell be our prisoner then well jump him and really make him our prisoner hell never suspect it aang and sokka carry toph away
following sarcastically you are a master of surprise sokka 
cut to tophs feet as they are dipped into a fountain
ahhh thats the stuff now i know how the rest of you guys feel not being able to see with your feet stinks katara sits next to her putting a hand on her shoulder
meanwhile combustion man eyes the gang from a higher elevation he sets his sights on aang as he prepares to fire however zuko jumps in and knocks him offbalance causing his shot to be wild team avatar make to run away before hearing zuko
stop team avatar turns their head up to the sound i dont want you hunting the avatar anymore cut to a quick close up of aang looking up with shock as he is helping sokka carry toph cut back to zuko as he stands in front of combustion man arms spread out to block him the mission is off im ordering you to stop
combustion man shoves him away and attacks again
if you keep attacking i wont pay you attempts to firebend at him but combustion man grabs him all right ill pay you double to stop
zuko kicks combustion man as he fires causing him to miss again he subsequently takes aim at zuko zuko creates a firewall to stop the attack but is pushed off the ledge cut to a shot of team avatar looking over the edge of the fountain shocked cut to a shot from behind combustion man as he faces a small crater in the floor and the smoke that is dissipating cut to a shot of the edge of the ledge and strafe right revealing climbing a vine hanging underneath it and zuko survived by grabbing the plants root cut to combustion man as he turns back cut to a close up of aang as he stands up from behind the fountain pool and runs to the side cut to a shot of aang doing a spinning back kick airbending and kicking up the dust around him and leaping straight up just as a blast from combustion man explodes beneath him the camera turns up to aang spinning in mid air airbending a tornado and kicking it at combustion man combustion man leaps over the tornado and fires another blast as he descends aang lands and quickly back flips away from the blast landing next to katara and sokka cut to a shot of combustion man falling before switching to a shot of his metal clawed hand as it catches on a small ledge and breaks it slowing his fall he lands on a new ledge and rolls firing a blast just as he stops cut to a shot of katara and aang shielding themselves as the blast hits the fountain water the camera follows katara as she runs forward and bends the water from the pool cut to a far shot from the side as katara bends a huge wave up between them and combustion man cut to a shot in front of the camera as she descends from jumping bringing her arms down and crossing them and giving a battle cry the wave matches her arm movements and icicles in both directions cut to a shot of combustion man as the icicles speed toward him he brings his metal arm over his face and lifts his metal leg to shield him from the attack the icicles break against him combustion man flings his arms down to shake off the ice shards and steps forward an angry frown on his face cut to his perspective as he scans the area the group is nowhere to be seen aang fires a tornado which the assassin jumps over and fires again aang narrowly avoids the blast by jumping back combustion man falls and lands on a ledge as he fires and misses again katara bends water from the fountain and turns it into ice spikes but combustion man appears unaffected the assassin looks up and realizes they have disappeared but continues firing cut to shot of the team hiding behind a wall out of sight
hes going to blast this whole place right off the cliff side
katara looks out from behind the wall only to see another incoming blast
i cant step out to waterbend at him without being blown up and i cant get a good enough angle on him from down here
pausing for a moment to think before having an idea i know how to get an angle on him takes out his boomerang after another blast he sneaks his head out but has to hide from another shot he projects combustion mans angle with his boomerang all right buddy dont fail me now throws his boomerang
the boomerang hits the assassin in the head where his third eye tattoo is causing him to hit the ground before it returns back
yeah boomerang jumps up and grabs it but combustion man gets up albeit clearly shaken awww boomerang 
as the team runs back to their hiding spot combustion man gears up again but is dizzy and cannot aim properly his next shot fails to escape causing an explosion around him resulting in the building he stands on getting destroyed cut to his metal arm as it flies away from the explosion followed by the falling building the gang looks on shocked haru teo and the duke all appear from behind a pillar also shocked
zuko climbs a plant root having survived the ordeal later zuko again approaches the gang
i cant believe im saying this but  thanks zuko
hey what about me i did the boomerang thing
listen i know i didnt explain myself very well yesterday ive been through a lot in the last few years and its been hard but im realizing that i had to go through all those things to learn the truth i thought i had lost my honor and that somehow my father could return it to me but i know now that no one can give you your honor its something you earn for yourself by choosing to do whats right all i want to do now is play my part in ending this war and i know my destiny is to help you restore balance to the world to toph im sorry for what i did to you bows to her it was an accident fire can be dangerous and wild so as a firebender i need to be more careful and control my bending so i dont hurt people unintentionally
looks at zuko shocked hearing these words and thinks for a moment i think you are supposed to be my firebending teacher when i first tried to learn firebending i burned katara and after that i never wanted to firebend again but now i know you understand how easy it is to hurt the people you love id like you to teach me bows before zuko
bows thank you im so happy youve accepted me into your group
not so fast i still have to ask my friends if its okay with them to toph toph youre the one that zuko burned what do you think
go ahead and let him join pounds her fist into her palm jokingly itll give me plenty of time to get back at him for burning my feet
turning to sokka sokka
shrugging hey all i want is to defeat the fire lord if you think this is the way to do it then im all for it
approaching katara katara
glares at zuko for a moment and zuko starts to sweat reluctantly ill go along with whatever you think is right aang smiles
excitedly approaching the group i wont let you down i promise
aang katara and sokka exit the latter carrying toph later sokka shows zuko to his room
so here you go home sweet home i guess you know for now unpack lunch soon uhhh  welcome aboard zuko glances back and smiles at him yeah walks out of the room and meets aang in the hallway to aang okay this is really really weird
the two exit cut to zuko as he pulls out a painting of iroh he subsequently has another flashback to three years ago
if i have to i will spend every day of the rest of my life hunting the avatar i know its my destiny to capture him
placing a hand on his shoulder you know prince zuko destiny is a funny thing you never know how things are going to work out but if you keep an open mind and an open heart i promise you will find your own destiny someday
fade to zuko in the present smiling at the memory zuko suddenly notices a clearly disgruntled katara at the door
you might have everyone else here buying your  transformation but you and i both know youve struggled with doing the right thing in the past approaches him threateningly so let me tell you something right now you make one step backward closeup of zuko one slipup give me one reason to think you might hurt aang and you wont have to worry about your destiny anymore closeup of kataras angry face because ill make sure your destiny ends  right then and there permanently
she walks away and slams the door shut zuko slumps his shoulders
fade to credits
the episode opens with a shot of the sky from the western air temple and the camera pans below to zuko and aang standing on the balcony of an upside down pagoda in the temple
i know youre nervous but remember firebending in it of itself is not something to fear
cut to aang as he sighs heavily okay not something to fear
cut to zuko from behind aang but if you dont respect it he raises his voice as the camera zooms to a closeup of his face itll chew you up and spit you out like an angry komodo rhino
cut to aangs face as he yelps in fear before cutting back to zuko
now show me what youve got any amount of fire you can make
cut to aang as he inhales nervously and tries to firebend cut to a closeup of his palm as a small cloud of smoke appears and is dissipated camera pans left to aang
maybe i need a little more instruction perhaps a demonstration
cut to an aerial shot of the both good idea you might wanna take a couple steps back
aang walks back and shot cuts to a closeup of zukos face as he inhales deeply screen zooms back to show zuko grunting and cuts to his fist which lets out a very small flame aang applauds at this display
takes a step back what was that that was the worst firebending ive ever seen
cut to aang i thought it was  nice smiles slightly and shrugs
zuko grunts again and tries firebending again with all three attempts resulting in very small flames similar to the first he grunts and looks at his palms
frustrated why is this happening
rubbing his head confused maybe its the altitude
turning back yeah could be
scene changes to some pagodas and pans below to aang sitting on a broken pillar and zuko standing zuko attempts firebending which results in a similar small flame again he grunts and delivers another similar blast as aang yawns and lies down on the pillar
just breathe and  he delivers another blast with no improvement
gets up that one kind of felt hot
very angry dont patronize me you know what its supposed to look like
sorry sifu hotman
raises his arms to his head and throws them down back and shouts in frustration as aang cringes and stop calling me that
shot cuts to sokka walking toward the teacher and his pupil eating an apple sokka sits down near the two as they turn their heads toward him
hey jerks mind if i watch you two jerks do your jerkbending
frustrated get out of here he lashes his arm and points to a side
okay take it easy he drops his halfeaten apple i was just kiddin around he gets up and turns around laughing as he adjusts his shirt jerkbending still got it zuko drops his head dejected and moans
scene changes to an aerial shot of appa resting near a fountain at night and zooms to show him eating a small bale of hay screen pans to the right to show zuko leaning on a column with his arms crossed looking below and thinking deeply he turns his head to the campfire where everyone is settled for dinner and walks toward them
listen everybody ive got some pretty bad news ive lost my stuff he looks below dejectedly
raises both hands to her head dont look at me she folds her arms i didnt touch your stuff
im talking about my firebending its gone he looks below again
cut to sokka haru the duke and teo looking at him as the former freedom fighter sits up camera pans left as katara laughs and everyones attention is focused on her zuko looks at the waterbender with an annoyed expression
im sorry im just laughing at the irony you know how it wouldve been nice for us if you lost your firebending a long time ago
camera zooms back to show everyone sitting around the campfire and zuko standing well its not lost its just  weaker for some reason
holding up her bowl and glaring at zuko maybe youre not as good as you think you are
screen pans left to toph ouch she smiles sarcastically
with an idea i bet its because i changed sides
still holding her bowl thats ridiculous she drinks from the bowl
i dont know maybe it isnt maybe your firebending comes from rage and you just dont have enough anger to fuel it the way you used to
leans toward zuko and points a finger above sooo all we need to do is make zuko angry easy enough
sokka pokes zuko with his swords hilt in the head and waist several times laughing
okay cut it out sokka stops poking as his sword slips from his hands and is thrown above before falling on his head zuko rubs his nose look even if youre right i dont want to rely on hate and anger anymore there has to be another way
cut to toph as sokka sits near her and rubs his head youre gonna need to learn to draw your firebending from a different source i recommend the original source eats the food from her bowl
excited hows he supposed to do thatu200c by jumping into a volcanou200c
no zuko needs to go back to whatever the original source of firebending is
seriouslyu200b so is it jumping into a volcano
i dont know places her bowl down as the shot cuts to a closeup of her face for earthbending the original benders were badgermoles
scene changes to a cave in a flashback as a younger toph wearing a gown is kneeling down and crying as screen zooms out
voiceover one day when i was little i ran away and hid in a cave
cut to the younger tophs face as she is startled by a rumbling noise and part of the caves wall breaks shot cuts to behind toph to show one of a badgermoles legs
thats where i met them
toph cringes in fear and the badgermole comes into the screen near toph and sniffs her toph sniffs back and the badgermole licks her cheek causing her to giggle in delight she touches the badgermoles snout with both hands before licking it and giggles again
they were blind just like me the badgermole walks away as toph attempts to crawls after it so we understood each other i was able to learn earthbending cut to an overhead shot of the badgermole which moves its paws in a sweeping motion not just as a martial art but as an extension of my senses screen fades to an overhead shot of toph mimicking the creatures actions for them the original earthbenders the badgermole comes across a pile of rocks and earthbends them to the side it wasnt just about fighting it was their way of interacting with the world she stops crawling and stands up she earthbends a stone and smiles at her success
screen fades from the younger tophs face back to the present tophs smiling face
thats amazing toph
cut to an aerial shot of the group i learned from the monks but the original airbenders were the sky bison camera pans above to show a mural of three sky bison aang leans back to look at appa maybe you can give me a lesson sometime buddy
appa growls from the shed
well this doesnt help me the original firebenders were the dragons and theyre extinct
shot cuts to behind zuko as he looks at the group what do you meanu200c roku had a dragon and there were plenty of dragons when i was a kid
cut to zukos face as he yells well they arent around anymore okay
okay okay moves his arms in an appeasing manner im sorry
but maybe theres another way he walks toward a fountain the first people to learn from the dragons were the ancient sun warriors
walks toward zuko sun warriors well i know they werent around when i was a kid
turning his head toward aang no they died off thousands of years ago but their civilization wasnt too far from where we are now cut to a shot of the two from the side as zuko turns his head toward the avatar maybe we can learn something by poking around their ruins
its like the monks used to tell me sometimes the shadows of the past can be felt by the present
so what aang and zuko look back at him and the shot cuts to sokka seated maybe youll pick up some super old sun warrior energy just by standing moves his hand in a strange motion where they stood a thousand years ago
cut to an aerial shot more or less either i find a new way to firebend cut to a shot of the two from the side zuko turns his head toward aang or the avatar has to find a new teacher aang looks concerned and worried at zukos statement
scene changes to aang and zuko flying on appa over an ocean cut to a bored zuko
weve been riding for hours i dont know why but i thought this thing would be a lot faster
cut to appa from below as he growls
turning his head toward zuko appas right zuko in our group typically we start our missions with a more upbeat attitude
whispering i cant believe this he lies down
cut to appa flying from behind dont worry youll get the hang of it
scene changes to an aerial shot of the ocean as the screen pans above to an aerial shot of an island scene changes to an aerial shot of appa descending to land on some ruins the ruins make aang and zuko full of awe
whoa
cut to appa landing from the side shot cuts to show some mountains and pans below to an aerial shot of aang and zuko walking through the ruins
even though these buildings are ancient theres something eerily familiar about them cut to aang and zuko walking i can tell the fire sages temples are somehow descended from these
cut to some structures as screen pans right to show more of them okay weve learned something about architecture cut back to the two walking hopefully well learn something about firebending too the past can be a great teacher
cut to a tripwire which is pulled when aang walks by he trips and yelps as an overhead shot shows a small portion of the path in front of him going down and some spikes coming up from holes aang nearly falls on the spikes but blows a blast of air from his mouth which thrusts him up and somersaults on to the other side as he managed to regain balance
scared zuko i think the past is trying to kill me
kneeling down to inspect the spikes i cant believe it he picks the tripwire up and examines it this booby trap must be centuries old and it still works
theres probably a lot more maybe this means we shouldnt be here
zuko takes two steps back and runs toward the wall adjoining the path he runs on the wall before jumping on the other side of the spikes
dusting some dirt on his shirt wheres that upbeat attitude you were talkin about he smiles as aang turns back cut to zukos point of view of the path as screen pans above to a building besides people dont make traps unless theyve got something worth protecting
cut to zuko and aang coming onto the building from stairs
look this seems promising cut to zuko and aang from the behind as they see a carving of a person being surrounded by two dragons who are breathing fire at him though im not sure what this tells us about the original source of firebending
cut to zuko and aang looking at the carving from the side they look pretty angry to me
cut to a part of the carving from below as screen pans right to show more of it i thought the dragons were friends with the sun warriors
well they had a funny way of showing it
cut back to the both from the side as zuko looks down for a moment and starts walking with aang looking
zuko zuko stops walking something happened to the dragons in the last hundred years zuko closes his eyes something youre not telling me
he opens his eyes my greatgrandfather sozin happened
zuko walks away with aang following him scene changes to the two walking on a bridge
he started the tradition of hunting dragons for glory there were the ultimate firebenders cut to them walking from below the bridge with the screen panning right as they walk and if you could conquer one your firebending talents would become legendary and youd earn the honorary title dragon they approach a path which has one dragons statue on both sides and stop walking the last great dragon was conquered long before i was born cut to a closeup of one of the dragons statues eyes as zuko places one of his palms on it by my uncle
cut to the both from a side but i thought your uncle was  i dont know good
he had a complicated past cut to zukos face family tradition i guess lets just move on
zuko starts walking as shot cuts to an overhead shot of him walking away with aang running to catch up to him scene changes to a vertical column with a sunstone in the center as zuko and aang walk past it screen pans above to show a wall with two gates with the both walking toward them as the both come closer zuko stops walking and aang runs to the gates drops his staff and unsuccessfully tries opening the gates
its locked up
zuko rubs his head and looks behind before quickly going aside to show the sunstone from the column in front of the gates beaming light
wait cut to an overhead shot of zuko as he realizes something and takes a step behind and looks at the position he stood at a moment before screen zooms in to show the light from the sunstone beaming on a circular carving on the ground its a celestial calendar cut to an aerial shot of zuko and aang standing in front of the column as screen pans to right to show the gates just like the fire sages have in their temples cut to a similar sunstone above the gates i bet that sunstone opens the door but only when sunlight hits at just the right angle screen pans below to show aang in front of the gates on the solstice
exasperated monkeyfeathers the solstice again we cant wait here that long
cut to zuko no we cant he unsheathes one of his swords but we might be able to speed time up cut to the circle carved on the ground on which light from the sunstone is being beamed he places his sword on it with an angle causing it to reflect the light cut to zuko reflecting the light from the column lets see if we can outsmart the sunstone
cut to the side of the gate as the light being reflected by zukos sword moves to the other sunstone on top of the gates screen pans below to show aang looking at it
nothings happening
cut to zuko who is kneeling down and reflecting the light come on 
cut to a closeup of the sunstone as the ground starts shaking cut to inside the room as the gates are opened and the shaking stops
he picks his staff and zuko walking up to the gates unsheathes his sword you know zuko i dont care what everyone else says about you aang nudges zuko with his elbow youre pretty smart
zuko smiles at aangs compliment before realizing what aang actually said aang walks inside the dark room and looks around it he narrows his eyes as the shot cuts to show a statue of a man with an angry expression cut back to aang who gasps
relax theyre just statues
cut to a shot of two statues from behind aang and zuko cut to an aerial shot of the room to show many statues lined up in a circle as they both walk into it aang walks up to a statue and reads something on it
it says this is something called the dancing dragon
aang places his staff to lean on the statue cut to a shot of the statue from behind aang to show him taking the same posture the statue is in cut to his leg which presses a button on the ground aang comes out of the posture and examines the button he looks around at all the statues runs toward zuko catches him by the hand and pulls him
zuko get over here i want you to dance with me
he pulls his hand back what
just do it
aang pulls him to a side as shot cuts to the both standing in front of two statues that are to the sides of the path that leads into the circle as zuko groans
lets follow the steps of the statues aang and zuko take the posture of the statue in front of them and move to their right and left respectively taking the postures of the statues in front of them which pressed similar buttons lying on the ground in front of all the statues cut to an aerial shot of the room dont you see these arent dance moves these statues are giving us a lesson cut to zuko moving through each statue i think this is some kind of sun warrior firebending form
this better teach us some really good firebending
cut to aang as he does the same moves as zuko cut to two statues with their waists bent toward each other and their arms in the direction of each other zuko and aang perform the same move cut to a part of the ground detracting and a vertical column emerging from it as the both look behind at it cut to a closeup of the yellow eggshaped sunstone on the column cut to an aerial shot of zuko and aang standing in front of the column as aang raises his arms in triumph
hurray putting his hands down and rubbing his head wait what exactly is that
he runs toward the sunstone its some kind of mystical gemstone
cut to the gemstone as zuko runs toward it aang raises his arms well dont touch it zuko stops and aang catches up to him
why not
remember what happened out there with those spikes turns to look at the side and raises his arms again im just very suspicious of giant glowing gems sitting on pedestals
zuko ignores the avatar and picks the sunstone as aangs eyes twitch
it feels almost alive
he tries to put the sunstone back but yells in surprise as a geyser of viscous slime erupts out from the pedestal and pushes zuko toward the grates in the ceiling sticking him there
cut to a worried aangs face as he turns to look at the gates of the room which close oh no its another trap

cut to zuko i cant believe there are still living dragons my uncle iroh said he faced the last dragon and killed it
looking at zuko so your uncle lied
cut to the smiling chief from the side actually it wasnt a total lie iroh was the last outsider to face the masters raising his hand above slightly they deemed him worthy and passed the secret onto him as well
surprised shot cuts to an aerial shot of the courtyard he must have lied to protect them so no one else would hunt them
cut to aang all this time i thought firebending was destruction since i hurt katara ive been too afraid and hesitant but now i know what it really is  its energy and life he smiles
yeah its like the sun he curls his hand into a fist but inside of you do you guys realize this
smiling well our civilization is called the sun warriors  so yeah
thats why my firebending was so weak before because for so many years hunting you turns toward aang as screen zooms out to show aang was my drive  it was my purpose aang turns toward zuko as well so when i joined you i lost sight of my inner fire but now i have a new drive cut to zukos face as screen zooms in i have to help you defeat my father and restore balance to the world

team avatar laughs and the shot cuts to zuko who shuts his eyes and cringes in embarrassment fade to credits
the scene opens to the western air temple at nightfall zuko is pouring tea to give to the members of team avatar
cut to a tray full of tea cups with zukos hand holding a kettle and filling up the empty cups no one can make tea like uncle camera pans up to zukos face but hopefully i learned a thing or two would you like to hear uncles favorite tea joke
sure cut to an overhead of the group sitting around a fire
i like jokes
bring it
okay serves tea to the duke and haru and stands up with his tray well i cant remember how it starts but the punch line the boys help themselves to the tea is leaf me alone im bushed no response well its funnier when uncle tells it
right  maybe thats because he remembers the whole thing
everyone else laughs zuko smiles a little
its nice to get a chance to relax a little it hardly ever happens
zuko hands tea to teo and toph he subsequently approaches sokka
hey can i talk to you for a second stands up and walks out
zuko sets down the tray of tea the camera switches to a shot of him and sokka walking away from where the rest of the group is gathered
so whats up appa wakes up and looks as they walk past him
if someone was captured by the fire nation where would they be taken
what do you mean who was captured
when the invasion plan failed some of our troops were taken i just want to know where they might be
i cant tell you
what why not
trust me knowing would just make you feel worse turns to leave but is stopped by sokka
its my dad he was captured too i need to know what i put him through

my guess is they were taken to the boiling rock
whats that
the highest security prison in the fire nation sokka looks at him horrified its on an island in the middle of a boiling lake its inescapable
so where is this place
why do you need to know what are you planning
nothing pauses for a moment boy youre so paranoid
its in the middle of a volcano between here and the fire nation you guys actually flew right past it on your way here
thanks zuko yawns just knowing makes me feel better
sarcastically yeah im sure it does
fade to later that night with everyone asleep sokka sneaks away from everyone he sighs and almost steps on momo narrowly avoiding tripping over him and waking him up he climbs onto appa who awakes
to appa shhh
appa goes back to sleep as sokka climbs on top of him however as he climbs up he notices zuko is already in the saddle with his arms crossed
not up to anything huh
falls off appa his bags contents fall out fine you caught me im gonna rescue my dad you happy now

a badgerfrog croaks waking aang from his rest
sighs nobody else has homework stands up and walks to a spot and starts hot squatting while katara and toph walk away one hot squat two hot squat three hot squat four hot squat 
scene cuts to zuko and sokka in the air in the war balloon zuko blasts fire into the tank to keep it moving a moment of awkward silence between the two follows
pretty clouds
yeah  fluffy sokka whistles what
what oh i didnt say anything you know a friend of mine actually designed these war balloons
no kidding
yep a balloon  but for war
if theres one thing my dads good at its war blasts more fire into the tank
yeah it seems to run in the family
looks at sokka defensively hey hold on not everyone in my family is like that
i know i know youve changed
downcast i meant my uncle he was more of a father to me and i really let him down
i think your uncle would be proud of you leaving your home to come help us thats hard
it wasnt that hard
really you didnt leave behind anyone you cared about
well i did have a girlfriend mai
smiles and looks at zuko with interest that gloomy girl who sighs a lot
smiles yeah everyone in the fire nation thinks im a traitor i couldnt drag her into it
my first girlfriend turned into the moon
shocked for a moment looks up at the sky briefly before glancing back at sokka thats rough buddy
nightfall sokka is asleep snoring loudly zuko continues to keep the tank full he stops to look out in the distance
there it is sokka awakens to see it theres plenty of steam to keep us covered as long as were quiet we should be able to navigate through it without being caught
as they enter the volcanos steam the balloon begins losing altitude quickly
frantically blasting fire into the tank were going down the balloons not working anymore blasts fire up into the balloon
the air outside is just as hot as the air inside so we cant fly
falls to the side as the balloon tips so what are we supposed to do
i dont know crashlanding
the balloon skids along the boiling water splashing sokkas hand which he shakes while blocking his mouth to prevent himself from screaming the balloon hits the base of the rock ejecting the two from it
looking at the destroyed war balloon how are we gonna get off the island if the balloon wont work
well figure something out i suspected it might be a oneway ticket
you knew this would happen and you wanted to come anyway
walks to the destroyed balloon my dad might be here i had to come and see
uncle always said i never thought things through but this  this is just crazy
gathers parts from the balloon together hey i never wanted you to come along in the first place and for the record i always think things through but my plans havent exactly worked so this time im playing it by ear so there after the hot water on the balloon burns his hand sokka kicks it into the water
what are you doing
it doesnt work anyway and we dont want anyone to find it
i hope you know what youre doing they both turn to look at the prison theres no turning back now
morning zuko and sokka have entered the prison and come out of a supply room filled with reserve guard uniforms both of them wear prison guard uniforms
i hope these disguises work
we just need to lay low and find my dad as soon as possible
a series of guards run by one of them runs back and looks at them

bluntly no you cant date the female guards

no thats not it the boiling rock it holds the fire nations most dangerous criminals right the other guards nod so what about war prisoners
in the yard the warden arrives on the gondolas meanwhile sokka and the bully guard continue to stand guard by the cooler sokka is looking inside at chit sang who is shivering

its a perfect boat for getting through the boiling water
exchanges a worried glance with suki the cooler as a boat are you sure
im telling you itll work flashes back to sokka walking around the island voiceover i walked around the perimeter theres a blind spot between two guard towers its the perfect launching point sokka puts a miniature boat in the water and watching it float away i already tested it out well roll the cooler into the water and just float with the current itll take us straight across as long as we dont make a sound no one will notice fade back to sokka talking to zuko and suki and bingbangboom were home free

one of you is an impostor who thought he could fool me chit sang steps forward but now that person is going to be in a lot of trouble who is it
sokkas teeth start chattering clearly nervous among the other calm guards the camera stays on sokka who closes his eyes

cut to a window the camera pans down to the bully guard in an interrogation room surrounded by two guards the warden stands in front of and away chit sang holding his hands behind his back

starts to sweat horrified wait dont tell the warden im just a little confused
hey im confused too but the wardens in a bad mood and  irrational so if you ask me its best not to question it and just do what he says places his arm around the guards shoulder
yeah  youre right were letting them out
the guard opens all the doors by pulling the levers the prisoners head for the yard the prisoners mingle in the yard where sokka suki and hakoda meet
this is it we have to start a riot
okay but how do we do that
smiles smugly ill show you shoves a prisoner
hey whatd you do that for that hurt my feelings
arent you mad at me
uh well normally i would be but ive been learning to control my anger
this isnt working
suddenly chit sang appears behind sokka and puts his hand on sokkas shoulder
hey you youre lucky i didnt rat you out smiles but my generosity comes with a price i know youre planning another escape attempt and i want in
gets an idea actually were trying to escape right now but we need a riot points to him you wouldnt happen to know how to start one would you
a prison riot please grabs a prisoner and lifts him in the air bouncing him up and down hey all the prisoners look at him riot

who let these prisoners into the yard cut to the warden on a balcony this is supposed to be a lockdown
the door guard who was in charge of the control room raises his visor and looks at the warden horrified he puts his back against the wall and sneaks away by quickly tiptoeing and ducks to a corner the camera cuts back to zuko and mai
maam theres a riot going on im here to protect you
i dont need any protection
gives a slight chuckle proudly believe me she doesnt
im sorry but im under direct orders from your uncle to make sure nothing happens zuko gives a serious look
zuko blasts fire at the guard and starts to run toward the door the guard jumps in front of mai to shield her
get off of me she throws the guard away from her and chases zuko
exiting zuko closes and locks the door trapping mai and the guard in the room he looks at mai through the slit in the door with regret while she stares back in anger before running off to join his friends back in the yard he reaches everyone else and slams down another guard as the riot continues
zuko good were all here now all we need to do is grab the warden and get to the gondolas
and how do we do that
im not sure
groans i thought you thought this through
i thought you told me its okay not to think everything through
maybe not everything but this is kind of important rubs his forehead
hey uh fellas i think your girlfriends taking care of it
sokka peeks out and looks amazed as he sees suki hop up on the heads of the rioters before jumping and flipping onto the tower she easily defeats the first guard with a few quick jabs two more guards arrive she ducks a fire blast and sweeps the first one promptly dodges the second ones fire blast and continues to climb the tower she makes it up to the top and defeats the final guard with a sliding kick she soon grabs the warden threatening him with her fist in front of his face
you wouldnt dare
ties his hands together and uses his headband as a gag sorry warden youre my prisoner now slams the warden against the wall the rest of the escapees arrive weve got the warden now lets get out of here
everyone else is out of breath
thats some girl
proudly tell me about it
cut to the roof as they all make the run to the gondola
were almost there
they are stopped by guards who launch two fire blasts at them zuko shoves sokka out of the way and blocks the two fire blasts more guards appear to help
back off weve got the warden the guards see the warden on chit sangs shoulder bound and gagged and clear the way lets go
they continue along their path cautiously watching the guards so they do not try any sudden moves they arrive at the gondola suki opens the door
everyone in
zuko starts the gondola and kicks the handle a few times attempting to break it he sees the guards rushing toward him and kicks the handle again and breaks it he jumps toward the gondola while dodging guards fire blasts sokka grabs zukos hand and helps him into the gondola
what are you doing
im making it so they cant stop us
way to think ahead
were on our way
wait whos that
azula and ty lee stand at the bottom of the gondola station all the guards bow down
thats a problem its my sister and her friend
looking up at the retreating gondola azula suddenly snatches a pair of handcuffs from a guards belt and runs forward behind her ty lee jumps up and onto the cable running along it toward the gondola after elevating herself to the line with a fire blast azula uses the cuffs to attach herself to the cable and propel herself forwaard the occupants of the gondola watch as they approach suki looking very grim
determined this is a rematch ive been waiting for
me too
sokka suki and zuko climb to the top of the gondola to meet azula and ty lee ty lee flips into the air and lands in front of suki who growls and assumes a battleready position azula pulls herself up onto the roof and faces zuko and sokka an overhead shot shows them all standing atop the gondola before closing in on azula again the fire nation princess assumes a battle stance and performs a slicing kick sending blue fire at her opponents but zuko blocks it ty lee and suki trade blows the latter blocking the formers attempts to use chi blocking each time ty lee is forced to the edge but jumps into the gondola and comes out the other side continuing her attacks zuko continues to wipe out azulas fire blasts sokka draws her back to the edge with his sword zuko goes in for a finish but azula dodges zukos blast and stays on the gondola she counters with a blast that goes wide almost striking suki and ty lee who barely manage to dodge it meanwhile the warden attempts to free himself while the other prisoners are distracted a male guard watches from a telescope
theres the warden i see him
frees himself and runs to look out of the gondola cut the line chit sang notices and grabs the warden
he wants us to cut the line
but if we cut the line theres no way hell survive
puts down his telescope he knows that
the guards stop the gondola by jamming the mechanism with metal bars the wheel screeches angrily as it grinds to a halt the gondola rocks back and forth from the sudden stop disrupting the combatants from their respective duels losing his balance sokka slides to the edge of the gondola but zuko pulls him in at the last moment ty lee jumps up to the top of the wire to see what is happening
theyre about to cut the line
the guards work to cut the line azula notices another gondola approaching on the other wire heading inbound
smirks then its time to leave blasts herself up goodbye zuko reaches the other gondola
ty lee backflips to the other gondola when she reaches it she looks back at sokka suki and zuko with concern in contrast to azulas sadistic smile the other three jump back into the gondola
theyre cutting the line the gondolas about to go
i hope this thing floats
pan down to the boiling lake the line is almost entirely severed by now but before the guards can finish the job they are suddenly yanked away from it and pinned to the wall by stilettos
what are you doing
the camera cuts to show mai standing near the line
saving the jerk who dumped me
other guards try to attack mai but she dodges all their fire blasts and retaliates with her knives pinning them all down by their wristguards mai rears up in front of a female guard who stops in fear and deploys four knives that send the two guards behind her flying dislodging one of the bars jamming the wheel mechanism she pulls out her threepronged sai and pins down the last guard releasing the block on the line she allows the gondola to continue in motion everyone looks back to see what happened
whos that
mai continues to fight off guards and turns her head to see the others
shocked its mai
angrily what is she doing
ty lee shrugs and makes a small sound as they watch her continue to fight off guards all of whom are helpless against her the gondola makes it to the top of the hill everyone leaves chit sang holds the warden and throws him back in when hakoda points at it
sorry warden your record is officially broken the warden struggles against his bindings
cut to the others escaping over the rim of the volcano

sokka turns and notices zuko standing still

what i mean is she must have come here somehow walks up to a large hill by the sea there pan down to a large airship thats our way out of here
back at the prison mai is detained by two guards while azula glares at her ty lee stands in the middle looking terrified and concerned at the two
leave us alone the guards give the fire nation salute and exit mai raises her head a little looking defiant i never expected this from you cut to a side view of mai followed by a frontal shot of ty lee who looks from one to the other tears in her eyes and back to azula the thing i dont understand is why why would you do it you know the consequences
i guess you just dont know people as well as you think you do you miscalculated i love zuko more than i fear you
her intrigued expression contorts into one of absolute rage no you miscalculated you should have feared me more
azula angles her fingers to create lightning and mai readies one of her stilettos her eyes narrowed before azula can complete her attack however she is struck twice by ty lee who chi blocks her cuts to mai blade still in hand and looking very surprised and to azula who dumbfoundedly falls to the ground paralyzed ty lee seems surprised at her own actions
runs to a shocked mai shaking her from her stupor come on lets get out of here
mai and ty lee are quickly surrounded by guards and captured before they can escape
still on the ground angrily youre both fools
azula is helped up by two guards mai and ty lee are both restrained looking defiantly at the princess

fade to outside the theater as team avatar is walking away
that  wasnt a good play
ill say
no kidding
horrible
you said it
walking with suki but the effects were decent
fade to credits
the episode opens on ember island outside ozais beach house aang practices firebending punches zuko watches him with his arms crossed
more ferocious imagine striking through your opponents heart
stops firebending and turns to zuko while growling in irritance im trying
now let me hear you roar like a tigerdillo aang gives a light roar as fire bursts come out of his hands and mouth cuts to a front scene of his embarrassed grin that sounded pathetic i said roar
aang roars even louder as three bursts of fire come out of his hands and mouth momo runs and hides behind zukos leg in fear zuko nods approvingly
holding up two watermelons who wants a nice cool glass of watermelon juice
brightens up upon hearing this ooh ooh me me me runs to katara
zukos hand comes into screen and grabs aang by the shirt of his robes hey aang keeps trying to run off but it is useless your lessons not over yet get back here holds aang up
lounging on stairs with sokka come on zuko just take a break whats the big deal
lets aang go fine aang happily runs off and takes a watermelon if you want to lounge around like a bunch of snail sloths all day then go ahead walks away
maybe zukos right sitting around the house has made us pretty lazy but i know lays his watermelon aside and stands up slowly just the thing to change all that takes off his robe revealing a bathing suit beach party
dives excitedly out of the cameras view camera changes scene to the ocean to show that he entered the water with a splash sokka surfaces with seaweed on his head and he blows water from his mouth he grins goofily katara uses waterbending to create an ice surfboard and surfs on the water cut to suki watching sokka grab some seaweed and bring it to an area he takes two buckets and fills them with water aang sticks the last piece of wood on a lifesized sand sculpture of appa finishing the last horn
check out my appa sand sculpture appa roars at the sculpture
not bad baldy aang jumps off the sculpture but ive been working on my sandbending cracks her fingers youre gonna love this
toph cracks her knuckles and uses sandbending to create a sand replica of the city of ba sing se aang peers down at the replicas details
amazed whoa wow youve even made a little earth king and bosco
sokka works hard on a sculpture
try and top that sokka
reveals a grotesque looking sculpture with seaweed for hair a starfish for a nose and rocks and shells for eyes and mouth ta da
is that a blubbering blob monster
defensively no its suki
aang looks at him with an animated shocked and surprised look until he and toph both laugh hysterically
suki well all understand if you break up with him over this
sitting on a beach towel i think its sweet
sokka runs and slides into screen on his knees as he grabs suki by her shoulders and kisses her on the cheek
but it doesnt even look like aah
he is cut off by a fire blast that destroys the sculpture zuko appears and chases after aang blasting at him with firebending aang jumps over the sand replica of ba sing se and zuko destroys the replica aang hides behind his appa sand sculpture
peeking out from behind the sculpture fearfully what are you doing
teaching you a lesson
zuko destroys aangs appa sculpture with a fire blast aang jumps back up to the house zuko goes after him continually firing blasts at him katara comes back to shore and sees the destruction
what happened
while rebuilding his sculpture zukos gone crazy i made a sand sculpture of suki and he destroyed it pauses a moment oh and hes attacking aang
katara toph and suki run after them the latter dragging sokka zuko chases aang onto a tree and sends another fire blast at him forcing him to jump onto the roof of the beach house zuko subsequently climbs onto the roof with him
get a grip before i blast you off this roof
go ahead and do it
zuko blasts fire at him aang slides down the roof and into the house he hides behind a dresser zuko breaks the roof with firebending and drops into the room he takes a fighting stance and looks around for aang aang kicks the dresser at him but zuko destroys it aang runs into the hall zuko augments fire into the hallway aang clears his part of the hallway from the fire using airbending
enough
aang airbends zuko out of the house everyone approaches zuko
worried whats wrong with you you could have hurt aang
whats wrong with me whats wrong with all of you how can you sit around having beach parties when sozins comet is only three days away everybody looks at zuko why are you all looking at me like im crazy
about sozins comet  i was actually gonna wait to fight the fire lord until after it came
shocked after
im not ready i need more time to master firebending
and frankly your earthbending could still use some work too aang grimaces
so you all knew aang was going to wait
honestly if aang tries to fight the fire lord now hes going to lose aang looks over to sokka as he says this frowns and closes his eyes in defeat to aang no offense
the whole point of fighting the fire lord before the comet was to stop the fire nation from winning the war but they pretty much won the war when they took ba sing se things cant get any worse
youre wrong turns away from them its about to get worse than you can even imagine flashes back to one day before the day of black sun servants help zuko get dressed on his way to a meeting once done they stay behind and bow to him as he walks on voiceover the day before the eclipse my father asked me to attend an important war meeting it was what i dreamed about for so many years my father had finally accepted me back
welcome prince zuko we waited for you zuko walks up to his father he bows to ozai and sits down next to him general shinu your report
thank you sir stands up and walks up to the opposite side of ozai across the table ba sing se is still under our control however earthbender rebellions have prevented us from achieving total victory in the earth kingdom
what is your recommendation
our army is spread too thin but once the eclipse is over and the invasion defeated we should transfer more domestic forces into the earth kingdom
hmm prince zuko youve been among the earth kingdom commoners do you think that adding more troops will stop these rebellions
the people of the earth kingdom are proud and strong they can endure anything as long as they have hope
yes youre right we need to destroy their hope
well thats not exactly what i
i think you should take their precious hope and the rest of their land and burn it all to the ground
yes  cuts to azula looking pleased yes youre right azula stands up and walks to the world map sozins comet is almost upon us and on that day it will endow us with the strength and power of a hundred suns no bender will stand a chance against us
what are you suggesting sir
when the comet last came my grandfather fire lord sozin used it to wipe out the air nomads cut to zuko now i will use its power to end the earth kingdom  zuko looks astonished cut back to ozai smiling permanently the shot changes to an aerial view of the map which ozai walks to the center from our airships we will rain fire over their lands a fire that will destroy everything and out of the ashes a new world will be born a world in which all the lands are fire nation and i am the supreme ruler of everything war generals applaud
voiceover i wanted to speak out against this horrifying plan but im ashamed to say i didnt fade to the present my whole life i struggled to gain my fathers love and acceptance but once i had it i realized id lost myself getting there id forgotten who i was
sinks to her knees i cant believe this
i always knew the fire lord was a bad guy but his plan is just pure evil
what am i gonna do
stands up from his rock seat and walks to aang i know youre scared and i know youre not ready to save the world but if you dont defeat the fire lord before the comet comes there wont be a world to save anymore
why didnt you tell me about your dads crazy plan sooner walks away
i didnt think i had to i assumed you were still going to fight him before the comet no one told me you decided to wait
holding his head with both hands this is bad sinks down to his knees this is really really bad
aang you dont have to do this alone
toph zuko sokka and suki stand next to katara
yeah if we all fight the fire lord together we got a shot at taking him down
all right team avatar is back air shot of aang water shot of katara earth shot of toph fire shot of zuko sokka gives suki a clump of leaves and holds up a large leaf fan and sword sokkas leaf wilts
fighting the fire lord is going to be the hardest thing weve ever done together but i wouldnt want to do it any other way
everybody except zuko laughs and walks over to aang for a group hug
yeah
all right
get over here zuko being part of the group also means being part of group hugs
with a resigned look on his face zuko joins the hug appa flies in knocking the entire group over the camera cuts to the beach house courtyard in another lesson between aang and zuko under the pavilion katara watches with momo at her side
theres one technique you need to know before facing my father  how to redirect lightning aang smiles if you let the energy in your own body flow the lightning will follow it uses his fingers to show how the energy should flow through the body you turn your opponents energy against them
thats like waterbending joins zuko in practicing the lightning redirection form
exactly my uncle invented this technique himself by studying waterbenders
so have you ever redirected lightning before
once against my father
what did it feel like
stops practicing the lightning redirection form exhilarating  flashes back to the moment for a few seconds but terrifying you feel so powerful holding that much energy in your body but you know if you make the wrong move its over
chuckles well not over over i mean theres always katara and a little spirit water action turns to katara am i right
actually i used it all up after azula shot you
disappointed oh
youll have to take the fire lords life before he takes yours
yeah ill just do that
the scene changes to the rocky cliffs near the beach
gather round team avatar puts a carved melon on a draped mannequin in order to take out the fire lord  or in this case the melon lord  our timing has to be perfect kneels down on the ground and uses a stick to draw a line heading toward the melon lord symbol first suki and i will draw his fire then katara and zuko charge in with some liquidy hot offense draws another line and while the melon lord is distracted draws a third line aang swoops in  and bam destroys the melon lord symbol with the line he delivers the final blow
uh  what about me
for now youre the melon lords forces
excited so i get to chuck flaming rocks at all of you
whatever makes the training feel more realistic
sweetness
fade to the melon lord the camera pulls back to show toph surrounded by boulder coated in grease with small bowls of fire set out in front of each boulder
mwahhahaha
katara and sokka look at aang and momo who look at suki and sokka sokka signals to the others to start moving sokka and suki run toward the melon lord but become confronted by stone fire nation soldiers who suddenly rise out of the ground sokka cuts one stone soldier in half and suki kicks down another one they keep running but a large burning rock boulder falls out of the sky blocking the cameras view of them suki jumps over the boulder sokka finds himself fallen down just a few inches away from the flaming boulder and jumps up
watch it toph
i am not toph i am melon lord mwahhahahahaha
toph lights a second boulder on fire and sends it through the air at zuko and katara they run around the boulder and become surrounded by a circle of stone fire nation soldiers which they quickly destroy
now aang
aang jumps preparing to strike the melon lord with his glider staff aang looks at the melon lord and changes expressions from anger to uncertainty when he lands aang stops his attack just before smashing the melon lord he backs away
what are you waiting for take him out
shaking his head i cant
walks up to aang whats wrong with you if this was the real deal youd be shot full of lightning right now
im sorry but it just didnt feel right i didnt feel like myself
sokka takes out his sword cut to aang wincing as he hears squishing sounds
offcamera there thats how its done
a piece of melon falls on the ground near the melon lord momo slurps some melon juice out of the piece the camera zooms toward aang who is horrified at the scene later that night team avatar shares a meal outside aang faces away from the rest of the group
holding a scroll i have a surprise for everyone
i knew it you did have a secret thing with haru she smiles while sokka suki and zuko look at her strangely
uh no everybody else starts eating again i was looking for cooking pots in the attic and i found this unravels the scroll showing a painting of a happy darkhaired baby playing at the beach look at baby zuko isnt he cute
everybody except zuko laughs
to zuko oh lighten up im just teasing
thats not me its my father
katara rolls up the scroll
but he looks so sweet and innocent
well that sweet little kid grew up to be a monster and the worst father in the history of fathers
the camera pans to him but hes still a human being
youre going to defend him
no i agree with you stands up fire lord ozai is a horrible person and the world would probably be better off without him but theres got to be another way
like what
i dont know perking up maybe we can make some big pots of glue and then i can use gluebending to stick his arms and legs together so he cant bend anymore
sarcastically yeah then you can show him his baby pictures and all those happy memories will make him good again suki and sokka laugh in the background
excitedly do you really think that would work
bluntly no
sighs paces back and forth this goes against everything i learned from the monks i cant just go around wiping out people i dont like
sure you can youre the avatar if its in the name of keeping balance im pretty sure the universe will forgive you
turns back to sokka losing his temper this isnt a joke sokka none of you understand the position im in
aang we do understand its just 
just what katara what
were trying to help
then when you figure out a way for me to beat the fire lord without taking his life id love to hear it walks away
aang dont walk away from this walks toward aang
puts a hand on kataras shoulder to stop her let him go he needs time to sort it out by himself
aang meditates at the beach house porch in front of four candles some berries a plate of fruit and a small cup of water momo flies in front of aang
stroking the lemurs head hey momo i dont suppose you know what i should do momo squawks i didnt think so
momo lays down to rest and soon aang falls asleep too after the candles have burnt out the camera pans out from the beach house to an island aang wakes up to chanting and walks toward the mysterious island barely awake with momo following him aang starts swimming when he reaches the water the scene changes to the next morning and the mysterious island is gone appa eats some hay while sokka sits on his saddle
okay thats everything
no its not wheres aang
team avatar runs to the beach house
aang aang
come on lazy bones lets go
suki and katara run to check one side of the beach house sokka zuko and toph run to check the other side zuko opens a door but does not find aang toph shrugs to show zuko she has not found him either zuko checks the porch scratching his head he spots aangs staff as katara and suki follow him
he left his staff picks up the staff thats so strange
walks onto the porch with toph aangs not in the house lets check the beach turns his head toward the beach
fade to the beach
look theres his footprints the camera pans up toward aangs footprints which stop at the beach the trail ends here
so he went for a midnight swim and never came back
maybe he was captured
i dont think so examining the footprints theres no sign of a struggle
i bet he ran away again
uhuh he left behind his glider and appa
then what do you think happened to him oh sleuthy one
its pretty obvious aang mysteriously disappears before an important battle hes definitely on a spirit world journey
but if he was wouldnt his body still be here
downcast oh yeah forgot about that
then hes got to be somewhere on ember island lets split up and look for him
toph latches onto zukos arm zuko blushes
im going with zuko sokka suki and katara stare at her what everyone else went on a lifechanging field trip with zuko now its my turn
sokka rides on appa searching the shores for aang in harbor city suki and katara approach a group of people gathered in a circle
chanting aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang aang shocked katara and suki glance at each other and simultaneously run into the circle
in the center of the crowd avatar state actor toph lifts her up in the air yipyip crowd cheers
suki and katara become frustrated by the false lead the scene changes to toph and zuko walking along the beach
and then when i was nine i ran away again
uhhuh
i know i shouldnt complain my parents gave me everything i ever asked for but they never gave me the one thing i really wanted their love you know what i mean
sighs and stops walking look i know you had a really rough childhood but we should really focus on finding aang continues walking
this is the worst field trip ever sighs and continues walking
later back at the beach house toph zuko suki and katara sit on the beach house stairs sokka lands appa below the stairs
judging by the looks on your faces im guessing you guys didnt find aang either jumps off appa
no its like he just  disappeared
hey wait a minute has anyone noticed that momo is missing too
turns back to appa oh no i knew it was only a matter of time jumps down to appa appa ate momo lifts up appas mouth momo im coming for you buddy
sokka appa didnt eat momo hes probably with aang
thats just what appa wants you to think climbs into appas mouth
get out of the bisons mouth sokka we have a real problem here aang is nowhere to be found and the comet is only two days away
what should we do zuko
katara suki and toph turn to stare at zuko in the background sokka slips out of appas mouth covered in bison saliva
stands up i dont know they keep staring why are you all looking at me
well you are kind of the expert on tracking aang
yeah if anyones got experience hunting the avatar  its you
sokka tries standing up in the background but falls back down zuko nods the scene changes to appa flying along the coast led by zuko
zuko i dont wanna tell you how to do your job but why are we heading towards the earth kingdom theres no way aangs there
just trust me
an aerial shot of the royal palace ozai and azula travel in palanquins to a ship
to her palanquin bearers come on slowpokes faster
ozai walks out of his palanquin and up the stairs azula runs behind him and gets on one knee to bow
pants sorry im late father good palanquin bearers are so hard to come by these days so is everything ready for our departure
facing the ship there has been a change of plans azula
worried what
ive decided to lead the fleet of airships to ba sing se alone you will remain here in the fire nation
but i thought we were going to do this together
my decision is final
you  you cant treat me like this rising you cant treat me like zuko
azula silence yourself
but it was my idea to burn everything to the ground i deserve to be by your side
azula she bows her head listen to me i need you here to watch over the homeland its a very important job that i can only entrust to you
really
and for your loyalty ive decided to declare you the new fire lord
fire lord azula it does seem appropriate but what about you
fire lord ozai is no more just as the world will be reborn in fire i shall be reborn as the supreme ruler of the world three fire sages help ozai put on his new royal garments from this moment on i will be known as  raises his arms in the air the phoenix king
servants pull up the phoenix emblem behind ozai soldiers raise the phoenix flags beside the fire nation flags two more soldiers firebend into the base of the flag pole causing fire to shoot out at the sides the crowd bows before their new king the camera cuts to ozai and zooms out cut to an aerial view of a tavern as team avatar approaches inside the tavern lively music plays zuko enters followed by katara sokka suki and toph
and the reason youve brought us to a seedy earth kingdom tavern is what now

ozai flies over to him using his fire jets shooting from his feet but aang lands on a boulder lifting it into the air he jumps away only to stop ozai for a second distracted by the boulder he continues to chase aang shooting at him with his fiery fist aang spins around creating a tornado shield that blocks him from the flames he lands on the side of a rock pillar and quickly scoots to the other side only to see ozai shooting another stream of fire at him aang leaps to another pillar before airbending himself back to the first pillar he kicks the top of the pillar off sending it toward ozai to aangs surprise ozai is right behind him and he sends a ball of fire toward aang
aang raises his hand to block himself from the surprise attack as he is pushed and hits the side of a rock falling to the ground in pain ozai flies toward him again and lands on the same ledge as aang seeing that ozai is there aang picks himself up and suddenly earthbends to create rock armor around his body ozai shoots fists of fire at aang pushing him around the edge of the ledge he swings his arm at aang sending a wave of fire toward him but he jumps away leaving the rock armor behind
aang suddenly performs a flip backward to shoot a gust of wind at ozai from the air ozai jumps aside to avoid aangs blast and begins to shoot lightning aang is grasping on to the side of a rock seemingly terrified just when the lightning is about to strike him he quickly swings his arm around to create another tornado shield he jumps up and flies to the top of a rock where ozai attempts to shoot a lightning bolt at him but misses after the failed attempt he continues shooting blasts at aang to which he lifts the top of a rock and dodges in order to evade he suddenly rolls forward just as ozai sends another blast of lightning toward him
aang begins to redirect the lightning pointing it toward the terrified ozai aang hesitates to strike him and so he sends the bolt into the orange sky instead he falls to the ground exhausted from straining to hold the energy from the lightning ozai smiles sensing he has the upperhand and performs a spinkick of fire toward aang who raises the ground to protect himself from the fire blast he is thrown off the rock from the impact and is falling toward the water below him the camera zooms in on his eye as he opens it and realizes he is falling
he tilts himself up frantically waving his arms and trying to airbend to break his fall seeing that does not work due to the speed he is falling as he nears the water he creates a funnel shape from it to land softly and gets washed up onto shore he quickly stands up to see ozai rocketing toward him cut to a shot of ozai
