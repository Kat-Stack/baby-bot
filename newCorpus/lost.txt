Act 1
[shot of kate, charlie, jack walking in woods. No rain or clouds. Jack is trying the transceiver. ]
charlie: anything?
Jack: you keep asking if there's anything.
Charlie: pardon me for appearing desperate, but before the pilot was ripped from the cockpit, he did say that no-one's going to find us unless we ... Get that transceiver working. So... Is there anything?
Jack: no.
Charlie: okay.
Kate: [to charlie] what were you doing? In the bathroom?
Charlie: i thought you could tell. I was getting sick. Puking. My one tangible contribution to the trek.
Kate: no. I'm glad you came. Charlie.
Charlie: every trek needs a coward.
Kate: you're not a coward.
[long shot of charlie's reaction. We hear a tapping sound. ]
[flashback - charlie on the airplane, tapping his ring against the seat's armrest, looking miserable. ]
cindy: you all right, sir?
Charlie: i'm good. Thanks.
Cindy: can i get you a water, or...
Charlie: [irritated] i'm fine. Thank you. Please?
Cindy: [nodding, but looking unconvinced] all right.
[shot of charlie looking back down the aisle to see some flight attendants talking in the back of the plane. Cindy starts walking toward charlie who bolts (this is where he bumps into jack). ]
charlie: excuse me.
Rose: guess he really had to go.
Cindy: sir, excuse me! [getting angry] sir, excuse me!
[charlie's trying to get into a bathroom, but they are locked. He bolts again away from the flight attendants that are following him. He's goes through the row where shannon and boone are. ]
shannon: [annoyed] excuse me?
[the turbulence starts. Cindy reaches for an intercom panel. ]
cindy: ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
[charlie gets into a bathroom and locks the door. He takes off his shoe to reveal a baggy of heroin. ]
jd: [through the bathroom door] sir, are you all right?
Charlie: just a minute. [charlie takes some of the drugs. We hear knocking. ] just a minute.
Jd: i'm gonna have to ask that you open the door, please.
[charlie looking into the mirror with a drugged out/relieved look on his face. We hear more knocking. ]
jd: open the door now, sir. Sir!
[charlie drops the drugs into the toilet, and reaches for the handle to flush the drugs away. Suddenly there's a big bump of turbulence, and charlie goes flying into the ceiling. He opens the door and falls down, with a food cart rolling toward him. He rolls out of the way just in time, crawls to a seat and puts the seatbelt and oxygen mask on. ]
act 2
[shot of shannon sunbathing. Boone enters. ]
boone: hey. We're going through some clothes. Sorting them. I see you found your bag. Come on, you want to give us a hand?
Shannon: not really. You're wasting your time. They're coming.
[boone walks away. ]
claire: [sitting next to shannon] is that your boyfriend?
Shannon: my brother. Boone. God's friggin' gift to humanity.
Claire: i used to have a stomach.
Shannon: you know what it is?
Claire: not yet. I haven't felt the baby move since yesterday.
[shot of tide pool. Jin getting an urchin. Sun looking on. Michael enters. ]
michael: uh, excuse me. Hey, uh ... Have you, uh ... Have you seen my boy?

michael: i'm sorry. [walks off camera] walt! Walt?
[shot of walt carrying a leash. ]
walt: vincent! Vincent! Come here, boy!
[walt finds handcuffs lying on the ground. ]
michael: [running up] hey! What did i tell you? After everything that's happened!
Walt: i thought that maybe vincent would be around!
Michael: i told you to stay on the beach!
Walt: this is so close to the beach, i thought this would be okay...
Michael: don't do that. You listen to me. I mean what i say. You understand?
[walt gives him a dirty look. Michael looks down to see the handcuffs in walt's hands. ]
michael: what is this?
Walt: i just found it.
[michael looks around, worried. ]
michael: [putting a protective arm around walt] come here.
Act 3
[we see a fight between sawyer and sayid on the beach. People standing around watching. ]
michael: hey guys. Come on, man. Hey.
Jack: hey. Break it up. Break it up! Come on! That's it! It's over! That's it!
Sawyer: son of a bitch!
Sayid: i'm sick of this redneck!
Sawyer: you want some more of me, boy?
Sayid: tell everyone what you told me! Tell them that i crashed the plane! Go on! Tell them i made the plane crash!
Sawyer: the shoe fits, buddy!
Jack: what is going on?
Sayid: ibn al-kalb!
Jack: what's going on?
Michael: [handing the handcuffs to jack] look, my kid found these in the jungle.
Sawyer: and this guy was sitting in the back row of business class, the whole flight, never got up. Hands folded underneath the blanket.
Sayid: oh.
Sawyer: and for some reason - just pointin' this out - the guy sittin' next to him didn't make it.
Sayid: thank you so much for observing my behavior.
Sawyer: you don't think i saw them pull you out of line before we boarded?
[sayid tries to get to sawyer again to hit him. ]
sawyer: come on, bring it!
Kate: [loud] stop!
[sayid backs off. ]
kate: we found the transceiver, but it's not working. Can anybody help?
Sayid: yes. I might be able to.
Sawyer: oh great. Perfect! Let's trust this guy!
Hurley: hey! We're all this together, man. Let's treat each other with a little respect.
Sawyer: shut up, lardo.
Jack: hey! Give it a break.
Sawyer: whatever you say, doc. You're the hero.
Boone: you guys found the cockpit? [jack nods] any survivors?
Jack: no.
Sayid: [looking at the transceiver] it's dual band, military spec. Chances are, the battery is good, but - the radio is dead.
Kate: can you fix it?
Sayid: i need some time.
Rose: [approaching] doctor, the... Man with the shrapnel, i... I think you should take a look at him.
[shot of sayid sitting on the beach, opening the transceiver. Hurley enters. ]
hurley: tsss. Chain-smoking jackass...
Sayid: some people have problems.
Hurley: tsss. Some people have problems? Us. Him. You're okay. I like you.
Sayid: you're okay, too.
Hurley: [laughs] hurley. [he reaches out to shake sayid's hand, then sees he's busy with the transceiver and puts it down] uh, just...
Sayid: [reaching to shake hands] sayid.
Hurley: how do you know to do all that?
Sayid: i was a military communications officer.
Hurley: oh yeah? You ever see battle?
Sayid: i fought in the gulf war.
Hurley: no way! I got a buddy who fought over there. He was in the 104th airborne. What were you - air force... Army?
Sayid: the republican guard.
[shot of the ocean. Kate is bathing. ]
sun: .    .  .
[sun points to indicate that kate is wanted somewhere. ]
[we see kate walking to sayid on the beach, drying her hair. ]
kate: is it working?
Sayid: seems to be. Except we're not picking up a signal.
Kate: why do we need to pick up a signal? Aren't we trying to send one?
Sayid: yes, but what you want to see here is little bars. The bars would show the radio is getting reception.
Kate: we need the bars.
Sayid: we could broadcast blind... Hope that someonemaybe a ship somewherepicks up our distress call. But that could be a waste of the battery, which might not last that long. There is one thing we could try...
Kate: what?
Sayid: seeing if we can get a signal from high ground.
Kate: how high?
[sayid looks up. Camera pans high up the mountain. ]
[shot of marshal mars with shrapnel, jack is working on him. Suddenly kate is there, and jack seems surprised. ]
kate: how is he? Can you do anything?
Jack: pull out the shrapnel.
Kate: but you said yesterday that if you took it out...
Jack: i know. But that was yesterday. I was hoping he'd be at a hospital by now. If i leave him like this, he'll be dead within a day. If i open him up... If i can control the bleeding and if he doesn't go into sepsis and if i can find some antibiotics... He might be all right.
Kate: i'm going on a hike.
Jack: sorry?
Kate: sayid fixed the transceiver, but we can't use it. Not from here.
Jack: kate, wait a minute.
Kate: you're the one who said that we had to send out a signal.
Jack: look, you saw what that thing did to the pilot.
Kate: yeah, i did. What makes you think we're any safer here than we are in the jungle?
Jack: wait for me. I don't know how long this will be... [he look at marshal mars. ]
kate: sayid said the batteries won't last.
Jack: all right. If you see, or hear, anything... Anything. Run.
Act 4
[we see sun and jin at the beach. Jin is cutting up the urchin. Sun reaches for a piece and he slaps her hand. He takes off with a tray of it. She looks disgusted and undoes her top button. ]
[shot of jin offering urchin to hurley. ]
hurley: what's that? What, that? What, eat that? [laughs] dude. Dude. I'm... Starving... But, i'm nowhere near that hungry. [laughs] no. No. No, thank you! No way, no. [laughs]
[shot of comic book with polar bear. Comic book is in spanish. ]
michael: the comic's in spanish. You... Read spanish?
Walt: no. I found it.
Michael: tell you what: we get home... I get you another dog.
[walt walks away. Shot of charlie getting his drugs out. Then we see hurley on the beach, jack comes up. ]
jack: hey! I need your help.
Hurley: okay.
Jack: i need you to help me go through the luggage. I need any kind of prescription medications you can find. Especially drugs that end in -mycin and -cillin. Those are antibiotics.
Hurley: what's this for?
[shot of charlie doing drugs. Then of shannon almost crying. Boone comes up. ]
boone: what are you doing?
Shannon: i think i was mean to him.
Boone: what?
Shannon: isn't that the guy from the gate? He wouldn't let us have our seats in first class. He saved our lives.
Boone: come on, shannon, we're trying to clear some of the wreckage. You should help out. You're just being worthless over here.
Shannon: i'm being what?
Boone: what do you want me to say? You're sitting on your ass staring at bodies.
Shannon: i've just been through a trauma here, okay?
Boone: we've all been through a trauma. The only difference is, since the crash, you've actually given yourself a pedicure.
Shannon: you know what? It is so easy to make fun of me, and you're good at it. I get it.
Boone: i wish i didn't have to waste my time making fun of you. I wish i didn't have a reason. Yeah, it is easy, shannon.
Shannon: screw you, you do not have the slightest idea what i am thinking.
Boone: i have a much better idea than you think i do.
Shannon: no, you don't!
Boone: okay, shannon. Then what are you thinking?
[shannon sees kate and sayid preparing to leave. ]
shannon: i'm going with them. On the hike.
Boone: yeah?
Shannon: yup. I'm going.
Boone: no, you're not, shannon. Shannon!
Shannon: [approaching kate and sayid] i'd like to come with you.
Boone: she's not going. She doesn't want to go.
Shannon: the hell i'm not.
Boone: it's what she does. She postures.
Shannon: you don't know what the hell i do!
Boone: makes really bad decisions to upset her family, which, at the moment, is me.
Shannon: shut up, and stop trying to be charming. [to kate and sayid] i'm coming with you.
Kate: i don't... Know if that's such a good idea.
Shannon: what are you? Two years older than me? Please. [to charlie who has entered] you're going, aren't you?
Charlie: yeah, are you?
Shannon: yup.
Charlie: yeah, i'm definitely going.
Kate: look, everybody can come. But we're leaving now.
Charlie: [to shannon] you couldn't tell from that, but she's actually really nice.
[shot of sawyer smoking, reading his letter. He sees the others walking off. ]
[we see the "hikers" in the jungle and sawyer is closing up to them. ]
kate: you decided to join us.
Sawyer: i'm a complex guy, sweetheart.
[shot of them making their way up a steep mountain. ]
[shot of michael on the beach where walt left him. Jack comes into the frame and opens a make-up type bag, looking for something. ]
michael: what you're looking for?
Jack: some sort of blade. How's your son?
Michael: walt? Yeah, i think he'll be all right.
Jack: how old is he?
Michael: nine... Tenten. Walt's more worried about his dog than anything. The dog was on the plane, so... Kids, you know.
Jack: is it a lab?
Michael: yeah.
Jack: yeah? I saw him yesterday, in the jungle.
Michael: what? Where?
Jack: over there. Couple hundred yards in or so. He looked good.
[jack finds a straight-edge razor. Shot of locke with the backgammon pieces. Walt approaches, curious. ]
walt: what is it, like checkers?
Locke: not really, it's a better game than... Checkers. You play checkers with your pop?
Walt: no. I live in australia with my mom.
Locke: you have no accent.
Walt: yeah, i know. We move a lot. She got sick. She died a couple of weeks ago.
Locke: you're having a bad month.
Walt: i guess.
Locke: backgammon is the oldest game in the world. Archeologists found sets when they excavated the ruins of ancient mesopotamia. Five thousand years old. That's older than jesus christ.
Walt: did they have dice and stuff?
Locke: [nods] mhhm. But theirs weren't made of plastic. Their dice were made of bones.
Walt: cool.
Locke: two players. Two sides. One is light... One is dark. Walt, do you want to know a secret?
[shot of claire writing in her diary. Jin approaches and offers her some urchin. She shakes her head, but then gives in and takes some. ]
claire: no. Tha- thank you. No, it's okay. [jin keeps insisting] no, really. Okay. Thanks.
[she eats some and then feels her baby move. She jumps up and makes jin touch her belly. ]
claire: oh, gosh. I just felt it. I ju ... Come here, feel this. Please. [jin resists, but claire keeps insisting]. Please. Please. Do you feel that? There! Right there, that's a kick! There! There, right there's a foot! Oh no, he's, wait, he's moving around. "he". "he". I guess i think you're a "he".
[shot of group in jungle. ]
sawyer: okay! Wide open space! You should check the radio, see if we're good.
Sayid: we're not going to have any reception here.
Sawyer: just try it.
Sayid: i don't want to waste the batteries.
Sawyer: i'm not asking you to keep it on all day.
Sayid: we're still blocked by the mountain.
Sawyer: just check the damn radio!
Sayid: if i just check.. We might not have any juice left when we get to...
[they all turn toward a sound they hear. Sounds of growling, movement. ]
shannon: my god.
Boone: what the hell's that?
Kate: something's coming.
Charlie: it's coming towards us, i think.
Kate: come on, let's move.
[they all start running off. ]
shannon: i shouldn't have come. Aah!
Sayid: go! Go!
[shot of them running, but sawyer stands and faces the bear. ]
kate: [turning to go back] sawyer!
Sayid: [grabbing kate] let him go!
[sawyer pulls out a gun and shoots serveral times. The bear drops just as it almost gets to sawyer. ]
shannon: that's... That's a big bear.
Boone: you think that's what killed the pilot?
[kate looks at charlie. ]
charlie: no. No, that's a tiny, teeny version compared to that.
Kate: guys, this isn't just a... Bear. That's a polar bear.
Act 5
[shot of jack and hurley with marshal mars getting ready to take out the shrapnel. ]
hurley: you sure he's out?
Jack: he's out.
Hurley: how do you know he won't wake up when you yank that thing out?
Jack: i don't.
Hurley: hey, guy, are you awake? Yo, there's a rescue plane! We're saved! Yaaay! [marshal mars doesn't react at all. ] yeah, he's out. Sowhat do you want me...
Jack: look, it's unlikely that he'll regain consciousness. But the pain might bring him around. And if it does, i need you to hold him down.
Hurley: uh... I'm not so good around blood, man.
Jack: then don't look.
Hurley: yeah. But.. I'm not so good around blood.
Jack: just do the best you can. Okay? Don't look.
Hurley: okay [looks like he's praying or something, mumbling something to himself].
[jack pulls the shrapnel out. ]
hurley: dude.
Jack: hand me those strips.
Hurley: dude.
Jack: just hand me the strips, i need to get this bleeding stopped.
Hurley: i don't think i can.
Jack: oh.
Hurley: "oh" what? What, what's going on, something in there? [hurley looks down]
jack: the strips. Just hand me the strips. Give it to me. [hurley looks sick. ] don't even think about it, hurley. Don't even think a... Hurley! Hey! [hurley passes out on the marshal] damn it!
[shot of the group in the jungle. ]
boone: that can't be a polar bear.
Sayid and kate: [at the same time] it's a polar bear.
Shannon: yeah, but... Polar bears don't usually live in the jungle.
Charlie: spot on.
Sayid: no, polar bears don't live near this far south.
Boone: this one does.
Sawyer: did. It did.
Kate: [to sawyer] where did that come from?
Sawyer: probably bear village. How the hell do i know?
Kate: not the bear. The gun.
Sawyer: i got if off one of the bodies.
Sayid: one of the bodies.
Sawyer: yeah, one of the bodies.
Shannon: people don't carry guns on planes.
Sawyer: they do if they're a us marshal, sweet cheeks. There was one on the plane.
Kate: how do you know that?
Sawyer: i saw a guy lying there with an ankle holster, so i took the gun. I thought it might come in handy. Guess what? I just shot a bear!
Kate: so why do you think he's a marshal?
Sawyer: because he had a clip-on badge. [sawyer holds up a badge] i took that too. Thought it was cool.
Sayid: i know who you are. You're the prisoner.
Sawyer: i'm the what?
Sayid: you found a gun on a us marshal. Yes, i believe you did. You knew where it was, because you were the one he was bringing back to the states. Those handcuffs were on you. That's how you knew there was a gun.
Sawyer: piss off.
Sayid: that's who you are, you son of a bitch.
Sawyer: be as suspicious of me as i am of you.
Sayid: but you are the prisoner.
Sawyer: fine! I'm the criminal. You're the terrorist. We can all play a part. [to shannon] who do you want to be?
[as sawyer turns, kate grabs the gun and points it at him. ]
kate: does anybody know how to use a gun?
Charlie: i think you just pull the trigger.
Sayid: don't use the gun.
Kate: i want to take it apart.
Charlie: oh.
Sayid: there's a button on the grip. Push that, it will eject the magazine. [kate follows sayid's instructions. ] there's still a round in the chamber. Hold the grip, pull the top part of the gun.
[kate follows sayid's instructions and gives the magazine to sayid and the gun to sawyer. ]
sawyer: [grabbing kate's arm] i know your type.
Kate: i'm not so sure.
Sawyer: yeah. I've been with girls like you.
Kate: no girl's exactly like me.
[kate walks off a ways. ]
[flashback - shot of kate on the plane. ]
michelle: can i get you a refill?
Kate: no, i'm... I'm fine with this, thank you.
Michelle: you, sir? Can i get you anything? Cocktail? Soda?
Marshal: just coffee, sweetheart. Black.
Michelle: [looking disgusted] coffee. Sure.
Marshal: you look worried. I'd be worried too, i was you. But you've got to stay positive, kiddo. You know, there's always that off chance that they'll believe your story. I know i sure do.
Kate: i don't care what you believe.
Marshal: oh, i know. That's true. That has always been true. You sure you don't want some more juice?
Kate: yeah, i'm sure.
[shot of kate with hands cuffed. Then the turbulence starts to happen. ]
cindy: [on the intercom] ladies and gentlemen, the captain has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Kate: i have one favor to ask.
Marshal: really? This ought to be good. What...
[the turbulence causes the big drop with a woman hitting the ceiling. A big black/silver case hits the marshal on the head. He passes out. The masks come down and kate can't reach because of the handcuffs. She gets the key from the marshal's pocket and unlocks the handcuffs. She puts her mask on and then puts a mask on the marshal. The back of the plane rips off. ]
[on-island - cut back to the group standing on the hill. ]
sayid: we should keep moving.
[shot of jack with the marshal. The marshal wakes up and grabs jack's shirt. ]
jack: no. No.
Marshal: where is she?
Jack: who?
[shot of kate walking with the group. Sayid getting the transceiver out. ]
sawyer: oh! Now's a good time to check the radio! Not before.. But now!
Sayid: we're up higher.
Sawyer: yes, we are!
Sayid: bar. Hey! We've got a bar! Mayday! Mayday! [we hear feedback]
kate: what is that?
Sayid: feedback.
Kate: feedback from what? What would do that?
Sayid: i don't know.
Sawyer: i'll tell you what would do that. This guy not fixing the radio. This thing doesn't even work.
Sayid: no. No, no, no, no, it's not broken. We can't transmit because something else is already transmitting.
Charlie: transmitting from where?
Shannon: what?
Sayid: somewhere close. The signal's strong.
Charlie: somewhere close? You mean on the island? That's great!
Boone: maybe it's other survivors.
Shannon: from our plane? How would they even
sawyer: what kind of transmission is it?
Sayid: could be a sat phone, maybe a radio signal...
Kate: can we listen to it?
Sayid: let me get the frequency first. Hold on.
Sawyer: there's no transmission.
Kate: shut up.
Charlie: the rescue party. It has to be. [they hear the transmission]. It's french! The french are coming! I've never been so happy to hear the french!
Kate: i never took french. What does she say?
Sayid: d-does anybody speak french?
Boone: she does.
Shannon: no, i don't. What?
Boone: what the hell are you talking about? You spent a year in paris!
Shannon: drinking, not studying!
[we hear a male voice from the radio. ]
radio: iteration 7294531.
Charlie: okay. What's that?
Sayid: oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
Kate: "no, no, no" what?
Shannon: what "no"?
Sayid: the-the batteries are dying!
Kate: how much time do we have?
Sayid: not much.
Boone: i've heard you speak french! Just listen to this! Listen to it!
Shannon: i can't!
Sawyer: you speak french or not? Because that would be nice.
Radio: iteration 17294532.
Charlie: that voice is weird. What is that?
Boone: come on. Come on, shannon!
Kate: come on!
Sayid: [moving his lips silently] come on!
[we can hear some of the transmission: il est dehors. ]
shannon: it's... It's repeating.
Sayid: she's right.
Boone: what?
Sayid: it's a loop. "iteration"it's repeating the same message. It's a counter. The next number will end... "533".
Radio: iteration 17294533.
Sawyer: does anyone know what the hell he's talking about?
Sayid: it's a running count of the number of times the message has repeated. It's roughly thirty seconds long, so... How long... [we see him trying to figure it out in his head].
Sawyer: don't forget to carry the one, chief.
Radio: iteration 17294534.
Shannon: she's saying .. "please". She's saying, "please help me. Please, come get me. "
sawyer: or she's not! You don't even speak french!
Kate: let her listen!
Boone: shut up, man!
Charlie: guys, the battery. The battery.
Radio: iteration 17294535.
Shannon: [translating] i'm alone now. Uhm... On the island alone. Please, someone come. The others, they're... They're dead. I-it killed them. I-it killed them all.
Boone: that was good.
Sayid: sixteen years.
Sawyer: what?
Sayid: sixteen years. And five months. That's the count.
Boone: what the hell are you talking about?
Sayid: the iterations. It's a distress call. A plea for help. A mayday. If the count is right... It's been playing over... And over... For sixteen years.
Boone: someone else? Was stranded here?
Kate: maybe they came for them.
Sawyer: if someone came, why is it still playing?
Charlie: guys. Where are we?
Act 1
[shot of jack's eye opening, looking up at bamboo trees. Overhead shot panning out to show jack is lying injured in a jungle. Jack sees a dog, slowly gets up, in pain. Finds a little liquor bottle in his pocket. Then he runs though the bamboo and emerges on a tropical beach. He sees plane wreckage and people running around, screaming, in distress. The engine is still spinning. Charlie gets dangerously close to it. Jin yells out in korean. ]
michael: walt! Walt!
Redshirt: stay away from the gas! Stay there!
[shannon screaming. Jack looks up at the wing. ]
redshirt #2: [trapped under the piece with the still moving engine] help! Help! Somebody help me! Help! Help! Ahh, my leg! Ah! Ah!
Jack: hey you, just give me a hand! You, come on! Come over here, give me a hand! [a group of redshirts (and locke) gather around to lift the metal piece that's trapping the man. ] on the count of three: one, two, three.
[jack pulls the man out from under. One leg is bloody. Jack starts ripping the man's pants to get to the wound. Jack uses his tie as a tourniquet. ]
claire: help! Please help me! Help me, please help me!
[jack sees claire, who is is pregnant and on her hands and knees. ]
jack: [to a redshirt and locke] all right, get him out of here! Get him away from the engine! Get him out of here!
[he runs over to claire through a lot of wreckage. ]
claire: help me, please. I'm having, i'm having contractions.
Jack: how many months pregnant are you?
Claire: i'm, i'm nearly eight months.
[jack looks over and sees boone doing cpr on rose. ]
jack: [to claire] how far apart are they coming?
Claire: i don't know, a-a few just happened.
[shot of locke and redshirt carrying bad-leg-guy away. A man named gary troup starts walking in front of the engine and locke sees him. ]
locke: hey! Hey, hey, hey, get away from there!
Gary: what?
[gary gets sucked into the engine and the engine explodes. Shot of people running. Jack sort of falls on top of claire to protect her. ]
jack: listen to me! Look at me! You're going to be okay, do you understand me? But you have to sit absolutely still!
[jack looking at boone giving rose mouth-to-mouth. ]
jack: [to hurley] hey, you! Come here! I need you to get this woman away from these fumes! Take her over there. Stay with her. If her contractions occur any closer than three minutes apart, call out for me.
Hurley: oh, you got to be kidding me.
Jack: i'll be right back, okay?
Claire: thank you.
[jack starts running off. ]
hurley: hey! What's your name?
Jack: jack.
[jack runs up to boone and rose. ]
jack: stop! Her head's not tilted far back enough. You're blowing air into her stomach.
Boone: you sure?
[jack starts giving her mouth-to-mouth. ]
boone: that's exactly what i was doing. I'm a lifeguard. I'm licensed.
Jack: yeah, well, you need to seriously think about giving that license back.
Boone: maybe we should do one of those hole things. You know, stick the pen in the throat?
Jack: yeah, good idea. You go get me a pen.
[boone runs off to get pens. ]
jack: [doing cpr] come on. Come on! Come on! Come on!
[rose breathes. ]
jack: big deep breaths. Take breaths!
[sound of metal. Jack looks up to see a big piece of metal high up (the wing) on some of the wreckage starting to wobble. Claire and hurley are right under where it would fall. Jack runs over to them. ]
jack: [as he's running] move! Move! Move! Get her up! Get her out of there! The wing!
[jack, hurley, and claire run out of way as there is a huge explosion. A big piece of burning debris lands near charlie. ]
jack: [to claire] you okay?
Claire: yeah.
Jack: [to hurley] you? [hurley sort of nods lying on the ground]. Stay with her.
Hurley: dude, i'm not going anywhere.
[jack sort of stumbling around the beach, looks into the fuselage. Takes a moment to steady himself, almost crying. ]
boone: [walking up holding out a handful of pens] i didn't know which one would work best.
Jack: they're all good. Thanks.
[shot of jack going through a suitcase, and finding a sewing kit. Jack going to a deserted part of the beach and taking his jacket and shirt off. He has a big gash on his side. Kate comes walking by, doesn't know jack is there. Kate rubbing her wrist. ]
jack: excuse me. Did you ever use a needle?
Kate: what?
Jack: did you ever ... Patch a pair of jeans?
Kate: i, uhm, i made the drapes in my apartment.
Jack: that's fantastic. Listen, do you have a second? I could use a little help here.
[kate walks over to him. ]
kate: and with what?
Jack: with this.
[jack shows her the wound, and she grimaces. ]
jack: look, i'd do it myself, i'm a doctor, but i just can't reach it.
Kate: you want me to sew that up?
Jack: it's just like the drapes, same thing.
Kate: no, with the drapes i used a sewing machine.
Jack: no, you can do this. I'm telling you. If you wouldn't mind.
[jack looks at her pleadingly. ]
kate: of course i will.
Jack: thank you. [handing her the little liquor bottle from his pocket] it's for your hands. Save me some for the, for the wound.
[kate picks up a little sewing kit. ]
kate: any color preference?
Jack: [laughing] no. Standard black.
[jack dumps the vodka on his wound. ]
[shot of sawyer lighting up a cigarette. Looking around. Then walking away, looks like he tosses his smoke down, disgusted-like; claire standing by the shore; hurley stacking airline food; locke sitting alone looking out toward the ocean; boone getting a "no service" signal on his cell phone. ]
boone: come on.
[shot of sayid adding wood to a big fire. ]
sayid: [to charlie] hey you. What's your name?
Charlie: me? Charlie.
Sayid: charlie. We need help with the fire. No-one will see it if it isn't big.
Charlie: okay, i'm on it. What's your name?
Sayid: sayid.
Charlie: sayid. I'm on it, sayid.
[shot of rose kissing the ring on her necklace]
[kate sewing up jack's wound. ]
kate: i might throw up on you.
Jack: [shaking his head] you're doing fine.
Kate: you don't seem afraid at all. I don't understand that.
Jack: well, fear's sort of an odd thing. When i was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16 year old kid, a girl. And at the end, after 13 hours, i was closing her up and i, i accidentally ripped her dural sac. Shredded the base of the spine where all the nerves come together, membrane as thin as tissue. And so it ripped open. And the nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and i ... And the terror was just so ... Crazy. So real. And i knew i had to deal with it. (he's crying). So i just made a choice. I'd let the fear in, let it take over, let it do its thing, but only for five seconds, that's all i was going to give it. So i started to count: one, two, three, four, five. Then it was gone. I went back to work, sewed her up and she was fine.
Kate: if that had been me, i think i would have run for the door.
Jack: no, i don't think that's true. You're not running now.
[shot of stars in night sky; charlie writing f. A. T. E. On his taped fingers, sitting next to sayid. ]
sayid: you think they would have come by now.
Charlie: huh? Who?
Sayid: anyone.
[shot of shannon painting her toenails. Boone comes up, offers her a candy bar. ]
shannon: as if i'm going to start eating chocolate.
Boone: shannon, we may be here for a while.
Shannon: the plane had a black box, idiot. They know exactly where they are, they're coming. I'll eat on the rescue boat. [he offers the chocolate again]. I'll. Eat. On. The. Rescue. Boat. [boone eats the chocolate. ]
[shot of claire sitting on a piece of wreckage. Hurley comes up with a tray of airplane food. ]
hurley: hungry?
Claire: yeah, thanks.
Hurley: anymore, uh... You know, baby stuff?
Claire: no. I'm-i'm okay.
Hurley: well, hang in there.
Claire: yeah, you too.
[hurley's arm comes back into the shot and gives her another meal. ]
[close up of michael]
michael: you sure you're warm enough?
[shot of walt lying on the beach under a blanket. He just nods, with a far-off look; shot of jin and sun. ]
jin:     .     . ? [sun nods. ]        . [subtitle: you must not leave my sight. You must follow me wherever i go. Do you understand? Don't worry about the others. We need to stay together. ]
[shot of kate standing over jack while he's working on marshal mars, examining the marshal's wound. ]
kate: do you think he's going to live?
Jack: do you know him?
Kate: he was sitting next to me.
[shot of a leaf torn into the shape of an airplane. ]
jack: [off camera at first] we must have been at about 40,000 feet when it happened. Hit an air pocket. Dropped, maybe, 200 feet. The turbulence was ... I blacked out.
Kate: i didn't. I saw the whole thing. I knew that the tail was gone, but i couldn't bring myself to look back. And then the, the front of the plane broke off.
Jack: well, it's not here on the beach. Neither is the tail. We need to figure out which way we came in.
Kate: why?
Jack: because there's a chance we could find the cockpit. If it's intact, we might be able to find a transceiver. Send out a signal, help the rescue party find us.
Kate: how do you know all that?
Jack: took a couple flying lessons. Wasn't for me.
Kate: i saw some smoke. Just through the valley. If you're thinking about going for the cockpit, i'm going with you.
Jack: i don't know your name.
Kate: i'm kate.
Jack: jack.
[metal/weird sound coming from the jungle. Everyone on the beach is looking; kate looks; locke looks (the camera pans forward toward him for a close up); walt looks; shannon and boone look. ]
shannon: what was that?
[kate looks back at jack; charlie and sayid look. ]
charlie: that was weird, right?
Walt: is that vincent?
[walt gets up and goes toward it. ]
michael: [getting up to follow] it's not vincent.
[shot of trees moving/getting smashed down. ]
claire: [coming into the frame] did anybody see that?
Hurley: [in disbelief] yeah.
[boone gets up, moves off. ]
shannon: boone!
[everyone moving toward the sound, except michael who backs off. Everyone looking out at the trees moving/getting smashed. ]
charlie: terrific.
Act 2
[flashback - shot out of airplane window over wing above clouds. Shot of jack. Sound of cart rolling up. ]
cindy: so, how's the drink?
Jack: it's good.
Cindy: that wasn't a very strong reaction.
Jack: well, it's not a very strong drink.
Cindy: [hands him two more bottles] shhh. Just don't tell anyone.
Jack: this of course breaks some critical faa regulations.
[jack puts one of the bottles in his coat pocket and drinks the other. He stands up, then charlie comes by him in the aisle. ]
charlie: excuse me.
Cindy: [in background, to charlie] sir, excuse me!
Rose: [looking at charlie, then at jack] guess he really had to go.
[two flight attendants run by. ]
cindy: sir, excuse me!
[jack sits back down. Then there is turbulence. Jack puts on his seatbelt. ]
cindy: [on the intercom] ladies and gentleman, the pilot has switched on the "fasten seatbelt" sign. Please return to your seats and fasten your seatbelts.
Jack: [to rose] it's normal.
Rose: oh, i know. I've just never been a very good flier. My husband keeps reminding me that planes want to be in the air.
Jack: well, he sounds like a very smart man.
Rose: be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
[the plane is really shaking now. ]
jack: well, i'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry it's going to be over...
[there's a sudden lurch and one passenger goes flying out of his seat and hits the ceiling. More shaking and screaming. The oxygen masks come down. Jack and rose put their masks on. Shot of another guy putting his mask on. ]
[on-island - shot of ocean, then jack looking out at the ocean. Rose and a bunch of redshirts in the background. ]
michael: it didn't sound like an animal. Not exactly, i mean.
Rose: that sound that it made, i keep thinking that there was something really familiar about it.
Shannon: really? Where are you from?
Rose: the bronx.
Charlie: might be monkeys. It's monkeys, right?
Sawyer: sure it's monkeys. It's monkey island.
Hurley: technically, you know, we don't even know if we're on an island.
Sayid: we're on an island.
Kate: [coming up behind jack] you ready?
Jack: kate, you showed me where the smoke was. I can get there myself.
Kate: i'm coming.
Jack: [smiling] well, you're going to need better shoes.
[shot of a dead body's feet. Kate reaches down to take hiking boots, checks the size. She looks at locke, who's looking at her. He gives her the "orange" smile. He keeps eating the orange and looks away. She looks slightly freaked out/disgusted. ]
[shot of a group: michael, walt, charlie, sayid, boone and shannon, with hurley approaching. ]
michael: whatever it was ... It wasn't natural.
Charlie: does anyone have any sun block?
Shannon: yeah, i do.
Charlie: ah. Cool.
Hurley: so, i was just looking inside the fuselage ... It's pretty grim in there. You think we should do something about the, uh ... [stopping and looking at walt] b-o-d-y-s?
Michael: what are you spelling, man? "bodies"?
Walt: b-o-d-i-e-s.
Sayid: that sounds like a good idea.
Shannon: no! They'll deal with it when they get here.
Jack: [entering] we go out and look for the cockpit. See if we can find a transceiver, to send a distress signal, help the rescue team. (to boone) you're going to need to keep an eye on the wounded. If the guy in the suit wakes up, try to keep him calm, but don't let him remove that piece of shrapnel. You understand?
Boone: yeah, got it. What about the guy with the leg? The, the tourniquet.
Jack: i stopped the bleeding. I took it off last night. He ... He should be all right.
Boone: yeah. Cool. Good job.
Charlie: i'll come with you. I want to help.
Jack: i don't need any more help.
Charlie: no, it's cool, i don't really feel like standing still, so. [jack nods. ] excellent.
[shot of valley looking out toward sea. You can see jack, charlie, and kate in the distance coming toward camera. ]
kate: may i ask you something?
Charlie: me? I'd be thrilled. I've been waiting.
Kate: have we ever met, anywhere?
Charlie: no, that would be unlikely.
Kate: hum.
Charlie: i look familiar, though, right?
Kate: yeah.
Charlie: [sighs. ] can't quite place it?
Kate: no, i can't.
Charlie: yeah. I think i know.
Kate: you do?
Charlie: [singing] you all everybody ... You all everybody! You've never heard that song?
Kate: i've heard it. I just don't know what the hell it is
charlie: that's us. Drive shaft. Look, the ringsecond tour of finland. You've never heard of drive shaft?
Kate: [incredulous] the band?
Charlie: yeah, the band.
Kate: you were in drive shaft.
Charlie: i am in drive shaft. I play bass.
Kate: seriously?
Charlie: yeah, charlie. Track 3, you know, i do backing vocals.
Kate: my friend beth would freak. She loved you guys.
Charlie: give me beth's number, i'll call her, i'd, i'd love to.
Jack: hey
charlie: does she live nearby?
Kate: have you ever heard of drive shaft?
Charlie: [singing] you all everybody... You all every... Body.
Jack: [shakes his head] we've got to keep moving.
Kate: they were good.
Charlie: they are good. We're still together. In the middle of a comeback.
[camera pans down to reveal vincent]
[shot of locke alone on the beach looking out to sea; we see clouds forming, sound of thunder. Shot of kate, charlie, jack in the jungle in the rain. ]
charlie: hey guys, is this normal? Kind of ... Day turning into night, you know? End of the world type weather. Is thisguys?
[shot of locke sitting on the beach with people running around to get out of the rain. Locke just sits there. Jin kicks a guy out from jin and sun's little overhang of debris; hurley runs past boone and shannon who are racing to get inside the fuselage. ]
hurley: i don't know if you want to go in there! There's too many bodies.
[shot of michael holding something up (some kind of tarp? ) under some debris, puts his arm on walt's shoulder. Shot of locke alone on the beach in a sort of meditation pose (music is sort of bittersweet). Locke holds his arms out, turns his face up to the rain, seems happy; we see the monster in the jungle by the beach. Claire and rose see it. ]
claire: there it is again.
Rose: oh my god.
[shot of jack, kate, charlie coming upon the cockpit. They all look a bit scared. ]
jack: well? Let's do this.
Act 3
[shot of jack, kate, and charlie making their way to the cockpit wreckage. ]
charlie: let's get this trans...
Jack: transceiver.
Charlie: transceiver thing and get out of here.
[we see them climbing up, through the front of the plane. There are dead bodies. Jack can't open the cockpit door, bangs on it with a fire extinguisher. ]
jack: come on! Come...
[the door opens and a body comes falling out. ]
jack: [to kate] you okay?
Kate: yeah. You?
Jack: yeah.
Charlie: i'm fine. Charlie's fine, by the way. Okay?
Jack: [to kate] hey. You don't have to come up here.
Kate: no, i'm good.
[kate and jack get inside the cockpit. ]
kate: so, what does a transceiver look like?
Jack: complicated walkie-talkie.
[kate climbs over the pilot looking for the transceiver when suddenly the pilot takes a breath. Jack and kate are shocked. ]
jack: hey! Can you hear me? [to kate] i need that water. [he gives the pilot some water] here. Here you go. Hey.
Pilot: how many survived?
Jack: at least 48. Does anything feel broken?
Pilot: no, no. Just my head's a little dizzy, that's all.
Jack: yeah. It's probably a concussion.
Pilot: how long has it been?
Jack: sixteen hours.
Pilot: sixteen? Has anybody come?
Jack: not yet.
Pilot: six hours in, our radio went out. No-one could see us. We turned back to land in fiji. By the time we hit turbulence, we ... We were a thousand miles off course. They're looking for us in the wrong place.
Pilot: we have a transceiver.
[the pilot moves to go get it. ]
jack: good. Good, that's what we were hoping. Listen, you shouldn't try to move.
Pilot: no, no. I'm okay. It's okay. Transceiver's right there. It's right there.
[kate gets it and hands it to the pilot. ]
jack: [to kate] where's charlie?
[kate goes to look for charlie. The pilot is fiddling with the transceiver. ]
pilot: it's not working.
Kate: [going through cabin, seeing two dead bodies] charlie?
[charlie comes out of the bathroom. ]
kate: what were you doing in the bathroom?
Charlie: what?
[the plane starts shaking. We hear the monster sounds. Shot of kate and charlie, pilot and jack reacting. ]
pilot: what the hell was that?
Jack: kate.
[shot of kate going back into cockpit with charlie's help. ]
kate: it's right outside.
Pilot: what, what's right outside?
Jack: shhhh.
[kate looks terrified. We see the shadow of the monster going past window. Jack tries to look out the window to see it. The pilot goes up to try and see it. Briefly hesitating, he first puts the transceiver on the co-pilot's seat, then climbs part way out of an opening above. Charlie comes into the cockpit. The pilot gets snatched out of a broken window. There's blood all over the window. ]
charlie: what the hell just happened?
[big crashing and shaking. Jack reaches for the transceiver just before it falls. The cockpit falls to the ground from its inclined position. Jack is reaching for the transceiver. ]
kate: jack, come on!
Charlie: just leave it!
[jack grabs it. They run. Monster sounds, running, anxious music. Charlie falls. His leg is trapped in some vines. ]
charlie: [shouts] hey!
[jack goes back to rescue him. ]
jack: okay, let's run.
[kate keeps running and ends up alone. ]
kate: [terrified] j-j-j... Jaaaack! [big door slamming sound/big footstep sounds. Kate is trying to compose herself] one! Two! Three! Four! Five!
Act 4
[shot of kate, she hears something and looks off. Charlie comes up behind her, she turns to find him and knocks him down. ]
charlie: kate!
Kate: where the hell is jack?
Charlie: i don't know!
Kate: did you see him?
Charlie: yeah, he pulled me up!
Kate: where is he?
Charlie: i don't know!
Kate: how can you not know?
Charlie: we got separated! Look, i ... I fell down, and he, he came back for me, that thing was just...
Kate: did you see it?
Charlie: no. No! But it was right there. We were dead! I was. An-and then jack came back, and he, he pulled me up. I don't know where he is.
[kate looks around. ]
kate: we have to go back for him.
Charlie: go back? There? Kate, there's a certain gargantuan quality about this thing.
Kate: then don't come.
[kate walks off, charlie gets up to follow (reluctantly). ]
charlie: kate!
[shot of jungle. Kate and charlie walking around. ]
charlie: i heard you shout. I heard you shout "jack". I'm charlie, by the way.
[kate sees something. ]
charlie: what is that?
[kate picks up pilot's wings from the muddy ground. Shot shifts focus from wings to the reflection in the water where they see the pilot's body in the tree above them. ]
charlie: what is...
Jack: [approaching] it's the pilot.
Kate: did you see it?
Jack: no. It was right behind me, but... I dove into the bushes.
Charlie: [pointing up to the pilot in the tree] guys? How does something like that happen?
[shot of bloody pilot in the treetop, bloody and with face-skin torn off, but not eaten. ]
Act 1
[the previously on lost ends with the detonation of the bomb - then cuts to the clouds, as the view zooms out to jack. Jack is then interrupted by cindy. ]
cindy: so how's the drink?
Jack: uh... It's good.
Cindy: that's not a very strong reaction.
Jack: well, it's--it's not a very strong drink.
[she hands jack a single vodka bottle. ]
cindy: don't tell anyone.
Jack: it'll be our secret.
[as jack pours the vodka into his drink, the plane shakes causing him to spill a little. Jack buckles his seatbelt. ]
cindy: [over p. A. ] ladies and gentlemen, the captain has turned on the "fasten seat belts" sign.
[rattling stops. ]
cindy: [over p. A. ] please return to your seats and keep your seat belts fastened.
Rose: it's normal. My husband said the planes want to stay in the air.
[jack chuckles. ]
jack: sounds like a smart man.
Rose: you be sure and tell him that when he gets back from the bathroom.
Jack: well, i'll keep you company until he does. Don't worry--
[the plane starts to shake again, this time more violently. Luggage falls from the overhead compartment and jack grips his seat, almost in anticipation. The turbulance ends and jack breaths a sigh of relief. ]
rose: you can let go now.
[passengers murmuring. ]
rose: it's okay. You--you can let go.
[jack let's go and sighs. ]
jack: looks like we made it.
Rose: yeah. We sure did.
[bell dings. ]
norris: [over p. A. ] sorry about the unexpected bumps, folks. We just hit a pocket of rough air. It should be a smooth ride from here on out.
[bernard returns from the bathroom. ]
bernard: [lowered voice] remind me to hold it next time, will ya? [normal voice] i almost died in that bathroom.
[seat belt clicks. ]
bernard: now i know how the laundry feels when it's in the dryer.
[rose chuckles. ]
rose: i missed you.
Bernard: i missed you, too, beautiful.
[jack visits restroom, and see's what appears to be shaving wound on neck. He then goes back to his seat to find desmond sitting in the row. ]
jack: excuse me.
Desmond: oh, i'm sorry, mate. Is this your seat? The stewardess said it was empty.
Jack: no. No, i'm at the window.
Desmond: oh, right. [unlatches seat belt] listen, mate, do you mind if i sit here? It's just the fella next to me has been snoring ever since we took off from sydney.
Jack: [chuckles] yeah, no problem.
Desmond: thanks, brother. [jack, unnerved, looks at desmond] something wrong?
Jack: no. No, you just... [sighs] do i know you from somewhere?
Desmond: [chuckles] well, i'm not sure. [holding out his hand] desmond.
Jack: [shaking desmond's hand] jack.
Desmond: nice to meet you, jack... Or to see you again.
[jack laughs, then sighs. The camera pans out the window and shoots down, miles beneath the plane into the ocean, where the entire island lies sunken under the ocean. The sonic fence and di houses are shown, as is dharma shark and the 4-toed statue. ]
act 2
[on-island - back in 1977, jack holds the jughead core over the swan shaft. The incident begins, resulting in juliet being pulled down the shaft by some chains. ]
juliet: aah! No! No!
Sawyer: juliet!
Juliet: aah!
Sawyer: i got you. No, don't let go!
Juliet: aah!
Sawyer: juliet! No!
[she falls. Down in the shaft, juliet hits the core. ]
juliet: [sobbing] come on! Come on, you son of a bitch!
[loud explosion - white flash. Focus on kate's eye - she regains consciousness to find she's up a tree - all sound is muffled. She nearly falls and manages to hang on. ]
kate: [grunting] aah!
[she climbs down the tree and reaches the ground. Muffled ringing noise continues. ]
kate: hello?
[this causes some discomfort and kate rubs her ears. The ringing gets quieter. ]
kate: hello? !
[kate starts to look around. ]
miles: hey!
[grunts - kate tackles miles to the ground. ]
miles: [grunts] hey! Hey! Kate!
[panting. ]
miles: it's okay. It's me, miles. It's okay.
Kate: what happened?
Miles: what?
Kate: where are we?
Miles: i can't--i can't hear you. Are your ears ringing?
[kate notices the doors to the swan station hidden in the vines and examines it. ]
miles: what is it?
Kate: we're back.
Miles: back where?
[kate runs to see hatch crater. ]
kate: no.
Miles: is that the construction site?
Kate: no. That's the swan hatch... After desmond blew it up.
Miles: guess we're not in 1977, huh?
[kate notices jack and sawyer on the floor - she goes to jack. ]
kate: jack? Jack. [he wakes up] can you hear me? Jack!
Jack: what happened? Where are we?
Kate: at the hatch.
[jack gets up and looks into the crater. ]
jack: what? They built it?
Kate: yeah. They built it.
[grunts - sawyer kicks jack in the face, who falls down into crater. ]
kate: sawyer!
[kate climbs down after jack. ]
jack: uhh!
Sawyer: you were wrong! [sawyer begins to climb down] that's the damn swan hatch--blown up just like we left it before we started jumping through time! You said we could stop it from ever gettin' built! That our plane would never crash on this island!
Kate: stop it!
Sawyer: this ain't lax!
Kate: stop it!
Sawyer: you blew us right back where we started! Except juliet's dead. She's dead, you son of a bitch, 'cause you were wrong.
Jack: [panting] sawyer... I'm sorry. I thought we were supposed to... I thought it would work.
Sawyer: well, it didn't!
[flash sideways - jack walks to restroom. ]
jack: you in line?
Mars: no, i'm just waiting for my friend.
[door unlocks and rattles. Kate bursts out and bumps into jack. ]
kate: oh!
Jack: whoa.
Kate: i'm sorry. I didn't...
Jack: [chuckles] it's okay.
Kate: i didn't see you there.
Jack: it's okay.
Mars: let's get back to our seats, sweetheart.
[they take their seats. Mars passes kate a meal tray. ]
mars: mmm. Lasagna.
[mars snatches the metal cutlery from the tray. ]
mars: no. No knife and fork for you, honey.
Kate: what do you think i'm gonna do, stab you and run?
[a man brushes past mars on his way through the aisle. ]
mars: hey, watch we're you're going, buddy.
Sawyer: [turning around] sorry. My bad.
[sawyer continues down the aisle to his seat. ]
arzt: say it. Come on, please? Just once.
Hurley: i really don't want to, dude.
Arzt: i love those commercials. Come on. Just do the australian accent, and i'll leave you alone.
Hurley: all right. Fine. All right. [australian accent] oi! Have a cluckity-cluck day, mate!
Arzt: [laughing] you know who this is? This is--this is the owner of mr. Cluck's chicken. And he's--and he's back here riding coach with the rest of us yutzes! Huh? [laughs]
sawyer: how about that?
Arzt: hey, um, do you mind me asking, how exactly did a guy like you get to own a major corporation?
Hurley: i won the lottery and i like chicken, so i bought it.
Arzt: oh. Good. Good for you.
[arzt leaves. ]
sawyer: you know, you really shouldn't tell people you won the lottery.
Hurley: yeah? Why not?
Sawyer: cause they'll take advantage of you. That's why not.
Hurley: thanks for the advice, dude, but it's not gonna happen.
Sawyer: it's not, huh?
Hurley: nope. Nothing bad ever happens to me. I'm the luckiest guy alive.
[hurley puts his headphones on and smiles. ]
[on-island - hurley sits outside the dharma van with sayid's head resting on him. ]
hurley: [loudly] what just happened?
Jin: i found a flashlight.
Hurley: dude, who cares? The sky just went from day to night. What happened? !
Jin: i think we moved through time.
Hurley: how do you know that?
Jin: white flash. Headache. Can't hear. Happened to me before.
Hurley: what about jack and everyone else? Did they move through time, too?
Jin: i don't know. They took one of the other vans and went up to the worksite.
[sawyer shouts indistinctly. ]
jin: and then i heard gunfire--
hurley: shh!
Sawyer: [shouting distantly] you said that our plane would never crash on this island!
Hurley: you hear that, dude? It's sawyer.
Jin: stay here with sayid.
[jin takes off. At the crater, jack and sawyer argue. ]
jack: the bomb must've gone off.
Sawyer: you think an atom bomb went off, we'd still be standing here? !
Jack: i don't know.
Sawyer: that's right! You don't! For once, you don't know!
Jin: jack! Sayid needs help.
Jack: where is he?
Jin: with hurley at the van. Two minutes away.
Juliet: [muffled, weak voice] help.
Jin: he's still bleeding. We don't know what to do.
Juliet: help me.
[kate hears juliet under the twisted metal of the swan station and investigates. ]
sawyer: so what do you say, doc? Got another great idea to save sayid? Maybe there's a nuke laying around.
Kate: hey, shut up!
Juliet: help.
[sawyer starts to clear the metal out of the way, and everyone else joins him. ]
sawyer: juliet!
Juliet: james?
Kate: oh, my god.
Sawyer: juliet!
[back at the van, sayid coughs and gags. ]
hurley: oh, god. Oh, god, this is gross.
[coughing and gagging, wheezing. ]
hurley: don't worry, dude. Everything's gonna be fine.
Sayid: [weakly] when i die... [groans] what do you think will happen to me?
Hurley: just--just try not to talk, dude.
Sayid: [inhales sharply] i've tortured more people than i can remember. I murdered. Wherever i'm going... [whispers] it can't be very pleasant.
Hurley: sayid, come on.
Sayid: i deserve it.
[hurley hears leaves rustling in the jungle. ]
hurley: hello? Jin?
[sayid wheezes. ]
hurley: jin!
[leaves rustle. Hurley picks up a gun. ]
hurley: i've got a gun!
[the rustling stops. Hurley struggles feebly to cock the gun. ]
hurley: and i know how to shoot it!
[he goes to investigate. The rustling starts again. Hurley hears footsteps behind him and turns around slowly. Jacob in standing there. ]
jacob: hello, hugo. You got a minute?
Act 3
[flash sideways - rose and bernard speak indistinctly... Both chuckle. Sun smiles as she watches them from her seat. ]
jin:    ? [subtitle: why are you staring at them? ]
sun: ...   . [subtitles: i-- they just seem so happy. ]
jin:  . [subtitles: button your sweater. ]
[she does. Locke is looking at a leaftlet about emergency procedures. ]
boone: you're wasting your time, man. This plane goes down in the ocean way out here, i think our chances of survival are exactly zero.
Locke: actually, in calm seas w-with a good pilot, we could survive a water landing. And, uh, the fuel tanks are buoyant enough to keep us afloat until we got in the life rafts...
[boone grins at locke. ]
locke: what?
Boone: no, it's just impressive you know that. So what were you doing in australia? Business or pleasure?
Locke: pleasure. You?
Boone: i went down to get my sister out of a bad relationship that it turns out she didn't want to get out of. So... Here i am. So what, you were just down under for vacation?
Locke: actually, i went on a walkabout.
Boone: really? Like--like crocodile dundee?
Locke: [chuckles] no, not exactly. But--but, uh, it was pretty intense. We--we spent ten days in the outback and, uh, nothing but our packs and our knives. We slept under the stars and made our own fires, hunted our own food.
Boone: wow. I wouldn't make it two days without my cell phone.
[both chuckle. ]
boone: you're not pulling my leg, are ya?
Locke: why would i pull your leg?
[boone chuckles. ]
boone: this thing goes down, i'm sticking with you.
[locke gives thumbs up. ]
[on-island - inside jacob's chamber the fire crackles. Locke cuts material from a rug and wipes jacobs blood from the blade. Ben stands over the fire, staring into it motionless. ]
locke: you can stop staring at the fire. Jacob's gone. He's gone.
Ben: why didn't he fight back? Why did he let me just kill him?
Locke: i guess he knew that he was beaten. Ben... I want you to go outside and tell richard that i need to talk to him.
Ben: talk to him about... What?
Locke: that's between me and richard.
[outside, indistinct heated conversation takes place between richard and bram. ]
richard: there's no other reason.
Bram: no, that's not how it's gonna be.
Richard: you have to--you're not going in there.
[speaks indistinctly. ]
richard: no [... Indistinct]
[speaks indistinctly. ]
richard: just back up a little. Okay?
[richard and bram speaking indistinctly. ]
sun: who are they?
Lapidus: other than the fact that i know they were on the ajira flight with us, all i know is they knocked me out and dragged my ass to some cabin, which they promptly burned, then... Brought me here along with the dead guy in the box. They say they're the good guys.
[both speaking indistinctly. ]
lapidus: i'm not buying it either.
[bram starts to walk toward the statue and richard stops him. ]
richard: listen to me. Hey! Listen to me, and listen carefully. No one goes in there unless jacob invites them in.
Ilana: richard, that's why we're here, because jacob invited us.
Richard: asking me what's in the shadow of the damn statue doesn't mean you're in charge.
Ilana: then who is?
[ben steps down the rocks onto the beach. ]
ben: richard. [panting]
richard: ben. What happened in there?
Ben: everything's fine. John wants to speak to you.
Ilana: is jacob all right?
Ben: i'm sorry. Who are you?
Richard: answer her question, ben.
Ben: well, of course jacob's all right. They're both together inside. John just wants to talk to you.
Richard: john wants to talk to me?
Ben: that's right.
[richard grabs ben and pulls him along the beach. ]
ben: richard, what are you doing? I don't understand.
Richard: well, i'm happy to talk to john. But before i do, maybe you should talk to him first.
[richard throws ben down on the sand next to where the body of john locke lays half-dumped out of the cargo container. ]
act 4
[sawyer, kate, jack, miles, and jin dig through the wreckage at the swan crater. Clanking metal, grunting. ]
sawyer: hang on, juliet! We're comin'!
[clanking metal, grunting. ]
jack: jin! Flashlight!
[jin hands jack the flashlight, jack shines the light into the hole. ]
sawyer: if we can move this beam, i think i can get down there.
[clanking metal, grunting. ]
sawyer: it's too heavy... We need something to pull it. Jin! The van. There's chains in it. Go get 'em!
[jin runs into the jungle. ]
[in the jungle, hurley follows jacob back to sayid and the van. ]
hurley: where you goin', dude? And what are you doin' here? I mean... I meet you in a taxi and you know everything about me and you give me a plane ticket which just so happens to get me back on this island. How'd you know that was gonna happen?
[jacob looks down at sayid, does not respond. ]
hurley: hello? Can you hear me? Why aren't you answering my questions?
[jacob kneels next to sayid, troubled. ]
hurley: look, my friend jin is gonna be here any second so you better stop ignoring--
jacob: your friend jin won't be able to see me.
Hurley: why not?
Jacob: because i died an hour ago.
Hurley: sorry, dude, that sucks.
[jacob stands. ]
jacob: thanks.
Hurley: how'd you die?
Jacob: i was killed by an old friend who grew tired of my company.
[hurley thinks for a moment. ]
hurley: you want me to do something crazy again, don't you?
Jacob: no. I need you to save sayid, hugo.
Hurley: well that's why jin went to go get jack...
Jacob: jin can't help him. You need to take sayid to the temple. That's the only chance he's got. And the rest of them will be safe there.
Hurley: the temple? I'm supposed to know what that is?
Jacob: jin knows. Tell him to take you to the hole in the wall where he was with the french team. Through that opening you can get into the temple. You still have that guitar case i gave you?
Hurley: yeah...
Jacob: bring it.
Hurley: who are you, dude?
Jacob: i'm jacob.
[hurley's eyes widen... In recognition? Rustling. Jin runs out of the jungle. ]
jin: hurley! Help me with sayid. We have to get him into the van. Juliet needs our help.
[hurley turns to find that jacob has disappeared. ]
jin: come on, we have to go!
[hurley and jin lift sayid into the van. Moments later, the van rumbles through the jungle. ]
hurley: jin, if i asked you to take me to where there's, like, a hole in the wall... Where you went with the french team... Would you know what i was talkin' about?
[jin thinks for a moment. ]
jin: yes.
Hurley: good.
[at the swan crater, the group hears the van approaching. Engine rumbling, tires squeaking. ]
jack: i'll get the chain.
[miles drops his shovel and follows jack to the van. ]
sawyer: juliet!
[he begins tugging at the beam, katie wrestles him off. ]
kate: stop it! Stop, sawyer! The van is here, the chains are coming.
[chains rattling. ]
sawyer: she ain't makin' any more noises...
Kate: no, she knows we're here. She's probably just resting.
Sawyer: juliet!
[jin tosses one end of the chain into the crater, jack picks it up. Sawyer looks at jack. ]
sawyer: if she dies, i'll kill him.
[chain rattling. ]
[flash sideways - jack sits in his seat on the plane. ]
cindy: [over p. A. ] ladies and gentlemen, nothing to be alarmed about, but if there is a doctor onboard could you please press your call button?
[electronic ding. Cindy approaches jack's seat and responds to the call. ]
cindy: sir? You're a doctor?
Jack: yes.
Cindy: could you come with me please?
[jack follows cindy down the aisle. ]
cindy: we appreciate your help. A passenger went into the restroom about half an hour ago and he's not responding when we knock.
[another airline employee is knocking on the restroom door. ]
cindy: this man's a doctor. If he's unconscious in there--"
employee: well, i think he tampered with the lock, it's... It's jammed or something, i don't know.
Sayid: can i be of assistance?
[they all stare at him. ]
sayid: excuse me.
[sayid kicks the restroom door open. Jack checks the pulse of a man wearing a familiar ring and listens for breathing. ]
jack: he's not breathing.
[the man is revealed to be charlie. ]
act 5
[cindy rushes to back of plane with medical supplies. ]
sawyer: what's goin' on back there, earheart?
Cindy: everything's fine sir, please just stay in your seats.
Sawyer: ... Yeah, looks peachy.
Jack: [to sayid] ... Sir, i'm gonna need your help.
Sayid: what can i do?
Jack: i need ya [jack pulls out breathing pump] to hold this over his mouth... Hold it there and do not let any air escape.
Sayid: ok, now?
Jack: yes, now.
[jack pumps air. ]
jack: somethings blocking his air passage. [jacks sticks fingers in charlies mouth] i'm gonna have to open it up. I need, uh, something sharp - a razor...
[cindy frantically looks. ]
jack: i gotta pen.
Sayid: a pen! ?
Cindy: it's regulation, there's nothing sharp.
Jack: a pen! Just a pen. I had a pen in my jacket but it's gone. Damnit.
[jack tries again - he gets the obstruction (heroin) out, passes it to sayid. Charlie wakes up, gasping for air. ]
jack: i got it, i got it. Relax, just relax, breathe.
Charlie: am i alive?
Jack: yeah, you're alive.
Charlie: [sighs] ... Terrific.
[on-island - sawyer and kate wrap the chain around the girder. ]
jack: you got it?
Sawyer: okay jin! We're good down here! [jin starts dharma van] ... Hit it!
[all struggle to get girder out - successfully. ]
sawyer: gimme the flashlight.
[sawyer climbs down to juliet. ]
sawyer: juliet! Okay... I'm comin... Juliet? Hey, i'm here, come on baby, come on wake up.
[juliet opens eyes. ]
juliet: hi.
Sawyer: hey.
Juliet: wh-wh-where are we?
Sawyer: don't worry about that. You're fine. I gotta get you outta here, okay?
Juliet: it didn't work, we're still on the island.
Sawyer: it's okay, it's okay, i just gotta get this loose enough to get you out, okay?
Juliet: no, i hit the bomb and you're still here.
Sawyer: you what? ... You hit the bomb? Why?
Juliet: i wanted you to be able to go home. I wanted to make it so you never came to this damn island [juliet starts crying] ... It didn't work.
Sawyer: don't you worry about that. You're gonna be ok. I'm gonna get you outta here and we're all gonna go home together, you hear me?
[outisde in the crater, kate is looking down into the hole. ]
kate: sawyer! ?
[jack is inspecting sayids wound in the van. ]
jack: even if i could get the bullet out, bleeding won't stop, there's nothing i can do for him.
Hurley: there's somethin' i can do. There's a temple, if we can get sayid there we can save him.
Miles: and you know this how?
Hurley: this guy jacob told me just before we got here.
Jack: who's jacob?
Hurley: does it matter? Can you fix sayid, jack?
Jack: no.
Hurley: then you're gonna have to let me do it.
[jack nods. ]
[at the beach, ben stares at the body of locke. ]
richard: ben, you need to talk to me. I can't stop them unless you tell me what happened in there. What happened to jacob.
[ben is silent. ]
richard: you and i have known each other for 30 years ben, i'm asking you this as a friend.
Ben: you wanna know what happened richard? Why don't 'cha go inside and find out.
[bram grabs ben roughly and pulls him along the beach. ]
richard: what are ya doin?
Bram: we're goin in, and he's comin' with us.
[bram and three others go with him, locke is waiting patiently inside. Ben gets pushed inside. ]
locke: where's richard?
Ben: he's not coming.
Locke: then who is that behind you?
[bram and three others walk in, rifles aimed and ready, almost ignoring locke and looking around. ]
bram: where's jacob?
Locke: jacob is dead.
[bram and others cock rifles and point at locke. ]
bram: who are you?
Locke: don't worry about me. Let's talk about you. I'm assuming that you are, what? Jacobs bodyguards? And that you came all the way to this island to protect him? Well i have good news, jacob burned up, right there in that fire. Therefore there's nothing left for you to protect. You can go. You're free.
[bram shoots locke in upper right section of body. Locke recoils from impact... Multiple other shots from bram and buddies are fired while locke runs behind a stone pillar. ]
bram: kill him! Spread out! Get him! ... Where is he?
[bram picks up bullet damaged by impact, with no blood on it. Smokey sounds surround them, then smokey appears in entrance, ben crouches in corner, scared. Smokey kills brams three buddies, but bram pours ash in a circle on floor and stands in it - it seems to stop smokey. Smokey hits the roof, knocking bits off which knock bram out of circle, at which point smokey kills him too. Ben starts to walks out, but hears footsteps behind him. He turns around. Locke is standing there. ]
locke: i'm sorry you had to see me like that.

[jack, miles, hurley, and kate watch as sawyer brings juliet's body to surface, sawyer gives jack the evil eye. ]
sawyer: you did this.
[flash sideways - charlie is bound by two male flight attendants, then taken to his seat, passing jack. ]
charlie: should'a let that happen man, i was supposed to die.
Cindy: don't take it personally, some people just don't know how to say thanks.
[jack goes back to his seat, noticing desmond is no longer there. ]

jack: he's awake, let him up.
[dogen ignores him. ]
jin: what are they waiting for?
Kate: that's enough!
[dogen continues to observe hourglass. ]
jack: [approaching dogen] i said, let him up!
[dogen uses martial arts to rapidly disable jack, and continues to watch sayid struggle. ]
hurley: you're not saving him! You're drowning him!
[sayid stops struggling just before the last grains of sand fall from the top of the hourglass. The others bring sayid out of the spring when prompted by dogen, who checks sayid. ]
dogen: [japanese] kare wa shinda [-he died. ]
lennon: you're friend is dead.
[jack goes to inspect sayid's pulse, then starts chest compressions. ]
kate: jack... Jack, stop, what are you doing?
[jack starts mouth to mouth resuscitation, and continues chest compressions. ]
kate: jack, he's dead.
[jack continues - kate grabs his arm. ]
kate: he's not coming back, stop it!
[jack stops. ]
act 4
[flash sideways - sayid is waiting for baggage at lax, looking at a photo of nadia. Kate is walking around with a coat hiding her handcuffs, she notices a lady using a code (75...1) on a security door for airport personnel. Kate sees tsa officials pointing in her direction, she goes through the security door and up an escalator and walks to a yellow-cab. ]
frogurt: woah, woah, woah, i don't think so lady, there's a line. There's a line!
Kate: sorry.
[she gets in line behind hurley. ]
hurley: [on cell phone] [indistinct chatter] ... Outback is just a name, you sayin' they own the entire outback? That's just stupid.
[kate notices mars is outside too, talking frantically to cops. ]
mars: [indistinct] ... She's gonna be coming outta customs i want you guys to take the other door.
[kate looks around, mars spots her, she turns to run. ]
mars: hey!
[kate gets into a cab. ]
kate: go... Go now!
Cab-driver: lady, i already have a customer.
[kate points gun at his head. ]
kate: i said go.
[camera reveals passenger is claire. ]
claire: hey. What are you doing?
Kate: [to driver] go now!
[cab accelerates away, mars sees it. ]
mars: hey! Stop the cab!
[on-island - kate, jack, jin, and hurley are sitting around spring, looking at sayid's body - cindy walks in, followed by zach and emma. ]
cindy: thought you might like a little something to eat or drink. Zach, emma, then take the rest to the people over there.
Random-other: just drop 'em in here.
[some others drag an unconscious sawyer and harassed miles into room. ]
kate: hey, what happened?
Miles: they jumped us in the jungle - he took four of them out, before one of them hit him with a damn rock.
[kate tends to sawyer, jack looks away - lennon walks up to hurley. ]
lennon: you, come with me.
Hurley: come with you where?
[they walk up to dogen tending plants in another room - without looking around he addresses them. ]
dogen: [speaks japanese] kare ni kiitekure, jacob wa seikaku ni nanto itta noka, donna shiji wo uketanoka [-ask him what exactly jacob said, what instructions he got. ]
lennon: he wants to know what jacob told you.
Hurley: he told me to come here. Said you guys would save sayid.
Dogen: [japanese] kare wa sudeni teokure datta [-it was too late for him. ]
lennon: he was beyond saving.
Hurley: wait a second - you're not translating anything i say to him - which means you totally understand me dude.
Dogen: [in english, to hurley] i don't like the way english tastes on my tongue.
Dogen: [japanese] de, jacob wa itsu kurunda [-so, when is jacob coming? ]
lennon: when's jacob getting here?
Hurley: what do you mean?
Lennon: is he coming to the temple?
Hurley: i really don't think that's gonna happen man.
Lennon: why not?
Hurley: you know - cuz he's dead.
[dogen faces hurley, consternated. ]
hurley: what - you guys didn't know?
[cut scene to jack - he hears bells start ringing and much activity/chatter amongst others. ]
dogen: [yells in japanese to the others] zenin haichi ni tsuke! [! -everybody, to posts! ] kabe no ue ni hai wo youi shiro [-on the walls, prepare the ash! ]
lennon: everyone to your posts! On the walls, prepare the ash!
[an other loads a large flare, another other starts pouring ash around the temple. ]
dogen: [japanese] kigashi no kabe ni shubi wo katamero! [! -defense to the east wall! ] juunin ha kita ni maware [meanings a: ! -evacuate the populace to north side! /meanings b:10! -ten men to north side! ]
lennon: ten men on the north side!
Dogen: [japanese] juubun chui shiro! [! -very careful! ]
lennon: send the warning!
Dogen: [japanese] mina ni konokoto wo tsutaerunda, yoshi tenka! [! - tell everyone! Okay, light it! ]
lennon: light it!
[flare is lit - red sparks explode overhead. ]
hurley: guess we're not getting outta here huh?
Lennon: this isn't to keep you in, it's to keep him out.
Hurley: him? Who?
[inside the base of the statue, locke drags bodies of bram and his team into a pile - ben sits by the fire staring at him. ]
ben: what are you?
Locke: wh.. I'm not a what ben, i'm a who.
Ben: you're the monster.
Locke: let's not resort to name calling.
[locke snaps protruding bloody rock from bram's chest, and drags his body into the pile. ]
ben: you used me... You couldn't kill him yourself, so you made me do it.
Locke: i didn't make you do anything. You should know, he was very confused when you killed him.
Ben: i seriously doubt that jacob was ever confused.
Locke: i'm not talking about jacob. I'm talking about john locke. Do you wanna know what he was thinking while you, choked the life outta him benjamin? What the last thought that ran through his head was? "i don't understand". Isn't that just the saddest thing you ever heard? But it's fitting in a way, because when john first came to the island, he was a very sad man. A victim, shouting at the world for being told what he couldn't do, even though they were right. He was weak, and pathetic, and irreparably broken. But, despite all that, there was something admirable about him. He was the only one of them that didn't wanna leave. The only one, who realized how pitiful the life he'd left behind actually was.
Ben: what do you want?
Locke: well that's the great irony here ben because, i want the one thing that john locke didn't. I want to go home.
[locke glares. ]
act 5
[inside the temple, hurley leans in to whisper into sayid's ear. ]
hurley: goodbye dude, if you ever wanna talk, i'm around.
[hurley looks at a confused looking miles sitting next to sayid. ]
hurley: what?
Miles: nothing.
[kate is tending to sawyer on other side of spring. He wakes up. ]
kate: hey.
Sawyer: where are we?
Kate: we're in a temple.
Sawyer: we got caught by the others again?
Kate: yeah, only, this time they're protecting us, i think.
Sawyer: course they are.
[sawyer sits up. ]
kate: you alright?
Sawyer: ah... [touches his forhead]
kate: i'm so sorry.
[sawyer stares at jack. ]
kate: you know what you said back at the hatch, he's just tryin'a help us.
Sawyer: i ain't gonna kill jack, he deserves to suffer on this rock just like the rest of us.
[flash sideways - jack is talking on cell phone in oceanic lost and found section]
jack: yeah... I know... I ... Do you think i knew this was gonna happen? I scheduled it so soon because i wanna get it over with. I don't know mom, he's not here so i can't tell you what to tell them other than we can't have the service without him. Yeah - i will call you if i hear anything.
[jack hangs up. ]
locke: [unseen until now] what did you lose?
Jack: excuse me?
Locke: well, they lost one of my bags, what about you?
Jack: you wouldn't believe me if i told ya.
Locke: hah, try me.
Jack: they lost my father.
Locke: i'm sorry?
Jack: he died in australia a couple days ago, and um, i flew down to get him.
Locke: my condolences.
[locke completes form he was filling out, and addresses oceanic staff. ]
locke: yo.
Jack: coffin was supposed to go on the plane in sydney, but it didn't. Apparently he's somewhere in transit which is their way of saying, they have no idea where the hell he is.
Locke: well, how could they know.
Jack: they're the one's that checked him in, i mean they've gotta have some kind of tracking system.
Locke: no i'm not talking about the coffin, i mean how could they know where he is. They didn't lose your father, they just lost his body.
[jack, seeming to understand locke, nods - locke smiles. ]
locke: either way, your story beats the hell outta mine - all that was in my suitcase was a bunch of knives. [oceanic staff gives locke a receipt] thanks.
Jack: some kinda salesman?
Locke: yeah, something like that. Well it was nice talking to ya, hope ya find that coffin.
Jack: hope you find your knives.
Locke: yeah, thanks.
[locke begins to wheel himself out. ]
jack: mind if i ask what happened to ya? [locke is silent] i'm sorry, i'm only asking because i'm a spinal surgeon, i didn't mean to...
Locke: oh, no, don't worry about it - uh, uh surgery isn't gonna do anything to help me, my condition is irreversible.
Jack: nothing is irreversible. Umm, if you ever wanna consult, just uh, gimme a call. [jack hands locke his business card] - it's on the house.
Locke: well thanks [takes card - reads name] - jack shephard, i'm john - john locke.
Jack: it's nice to meet ya john.
Locke: nice to meet you too.
[jack opens door for locke. ]
locke: thanks.
Jack: you're welcome.
[on-island - flare fired from temple is visible in sky - richard sitting on the beach notices it. ]
lapidus: what the hell is that?
[richard looks scared. Rifles are cocked and pointed at locke as people see him and ben walking toward them. ]
richard: don't shoot him! Don't shoot him!
Lapidus: i'm seein' it - but i'm still not believin' it.
[locke walks up to richard. ]
locke: hello richard. It's good to see you outta those chains.
Richard: [eyes widen] ... You?
Locke: me.
[locke immediately hits richard in the throat, then knocks him unconscious. ]
locke: i am very disappointed ... In all of you.
[locke puts richard on his shoulder, and walks right past the corpse of locke in the ajira cargo box. ]
[at the temple, lennon and a couple others walk up to jack, still looking at sayid's corpse. ]
lennon: you shephard?
Jack: yeah.
Lennon: we need to speak to you privately.
Jack: if you've got something to say to me then say it, otherwise just leave me alone.
Lennon: i don't think you're understanding me here, i'm asking politely, you either get up and come with us on your own, or i'll have ya dragged out. Because we are going to have this conversation and it's not going to be here.
[jack gets up and confrontation-ally approaches lennon. ]
jack: is that right.
[jack and others start to wrestle - hurley and lennon are both distracted by something else. ]
hurley: jack!
[all turn around to see sayid slowly stirring to life. ]
lennon: oh my god.
Jack: wha...
Sayid: what happened?
Act 1
[on-island - as the episode commences, lennon is walking briskly through corridors of stone at a quick pace. He checks to ensure no one is following him. He rushes into a chamber where the temple leader is typing on an old typewriter similar to an underwood model. The temple leader stops immediately at the intrusion. There is a baseball sitting on his desk. Out of breath, he speaks to the leader. ]
lennon: he's alive.
[the temple leader turns his head from lennon and stares straight ahead grasping his necklace. ]
[the scene switches to the chamber with the spring. Sayid is sitting, jack kneels in front of him. Hurley runs to sayid. Miles follows hurley. ]
miles: it worked?
Hurley: dude! You're okay!
[hurley hugs sayid tightly. ]
jack: hurley, let him breathe. Miles, can you go get some water?
Miles: yeah, on it.
[miles looks at sayid cautiously then leaves to get water. ]
jack: sayid, hey, how ya feelin'?
Sayid: a little light headed.
[jin joins hurley, jack, and sayid. ]
sayid: jack, what happened to me?
Jack: [exhales deeply] you died.
[sayid just looks around. Kate and sawyer are standing on the opposite side of the spring. ]
kate: how is that even possible? I mean one minute he's gone and now he's fine?
Sawyer: of course he's fine.
Kate: what's that mean?
Sawyer: [sarcastically] he's an iraqi torturer who shoots kids. He definitely deserves another go around.
[jin, jack and hurley help sayid stand up. The conversation is indistinct. ]
hurley: all right.
[sawyer continues to stare outside. ]
kate: what are you lookin' at?
Sawyer: how many guards with guns do you think are outside this place?
Kate: what? !
Sawyer: i was out cold when they brought me in here. How many guards did you see? Five? Ten? A hundred?
Kate: what are you thinking?
Sawyer: thinkin' about running, kate.
[flash sideways - at lax, kate is walking with her hands still cuffed and the marshal's jacket hiding them. ]
marshal: she's got hands in handcuffs but she's probably got them covered, okay?
[there is an indistinct male voice over the pa system. Kate and the marshal make eye contact. Kate turns and runs with the marshal in pursuit. ]
marshal: hey!
[the marshal runs after kate pushing a man out of his way. ]
man: hey! Watch it!
[kate gets in the back of a cab at the curb. ]
kate: go! Go now!
Cab driver: lady, i already have a customer.
[kate cocks and puts a gun to the driver's head. ]
kate: damn it, i said go.
[the passenger is in the back seat with kate. The driver speeds from the curb with the tires screeching. As the cab drives off, the marshal sees kate and runs after the cab. ]
cab driver: okay.
Marshal: move it!
[kate looks over at claire. ]
claire: oh! Easy, easy, slow down.
Kate: hey, just slow down. Slow down!
[claire grunts. ]
cab driver: okay! Okay! You said go!
Kate: just get us out of here.
[as the cab drives off, the marshal sees kate and runs after the cab. ]
marshal: hey! Hey! Stop that cab!
Claire: can you please, just let me out of - ah!
[kate points the gun at claire. ]
kate: be quiet!
[kate looks out the window and sees police cars and officers. Suddenly the cab driver slams on the brakes and horns honk. ]
kate: what are you doing?
Cab driver: there's a guy. I'm not gonna run him over.
[a man is bending over attempting to pick something up from the ground. It is leslie arzt. He turns to face the cab and begins to yell. ]
arzt: hey! I'm walking here. I'm walking here.
[artz has spilled his baggage from a courtesy cart. It is in the path of the cab. Horns are honking. In the offing, jack is on his cell phone. Kate and jack make eye contact for a moment. Claire tries to get out of the cab and kate pulls her back into the cab. ]
kate: do not get out of this car!
[claire nods yes and says nothing.. She is quite frightened. Kate addresses the cab driver. They are still in the airport parking terminal. ]
kate: just go. Go now! I don't care about the guy! Go!
Cab driver: okay.
[the cab drags one of artz's bags under it as it peels away. ]
arzt: hey! Hey! What the hell! Hey, i got your license plate!
[traffic light changes from green to amber to red. The cab stops for the red light. ]
kate: at the light, take a left.
Claire: [sobbing] can you, can you please, please just let me go? I promise i won't say anything to anyone.
[the cab driver takes this opportunity and puts the cab in park, gets out of the cab and runs away leaving kate and clair in the back seat. ]
kate: hey! Hey! Damn it!
[multiple car horns start honking. Kate gets from the back seat to the driver's seat and speeds away, tires screeching. A car at crossing the intersection almost hit the cab broadside. ]
claire: please! Please!
Kate: give me your purse.
Claire: what?
Kate: i said give me your purse!
[claire continues to cry. Kat pulls to the curb and stops the cab. ]
kate: now get out of the car.
Claire: can i please just, just get my suitcase?
Kate: no you can't! Get out of the car!
[a pregnant claire exits the cab and is left without her purse or luggage as she cries on the side walk. Kate speeds away in the cab. ]
[on-island - back at the temple. Kate is walking down a corridor. Jack and jin help sayid walk out to the courtyard. ]
jack: easy.
[sayid is led to a stone bench upon which he sits. Jin and jack release sayid's arms from over their shoulders. Miles approaches with water. ]
sayid: who are these people? What do they want?
[sayid accepts the canteen from miles and drinks from it. ]
hurley: it's the others, dude. They caught us [pause] again. I dunno, i think they are trying to protect us.
Miles: uh, as you can see, hugo here has assumed the leadership position so that's pretty great.
[jack is staring at sayid's abdomen. ]
sayid: [to jack] what?
Jack: the wound [rolls up sayid's tank shirt] it's almost completely closed.
[sayid rolls up the front of his shirt and looks at the gunshot wound. It looks like scar tissue and not a fresh wound. Sayid is confused. He turns to jack. ]
sayid: thank you jack.
Jack: for what?
Sayid: for saving my life.
[the temple leader briskly walks through doors from the temple, shoving them against the outside walls. Jack stands up. ]
temple leader: nani wa tomoare isogunda [in any case, hurry up. ]
lennon: [translates] mr. Jarrah, will you come with us, please?
[lennon turns and starts to walk. ]
sayid: come with you where?
Lennon: inside. Nothing to worry about we just...
Jack: [interrupts] i'm coming with him.
Lennon: oh, i'm sorry. We need to talk to him alone, just a few questions.
Jack: you have a few questions? Well, so do we. Let's start with who are you? Why are you holding us here? You ...
Temple leader: kono otoko wo damarasero [shut him up. ] [interrupts]
lennon: [translating] [pause] once we've spoken to mr. Jarrah, we'll be more than happy to tell you everything you want to know.
Jack: something tells me that you're not going to be happy telling us anything.
[jack looks into the eyes of the temple leader. ]
temple leader: tsurete ike [take him away. ]
[immediately, 2 men with the temple leader grab jack by his arms and start to beat him. Another man goes after miles. Two gun shots are heard. ]
temple leader: yamero! [! Stop it! ]
[as turn to see who shot a gun, they see sawyer who is cocking his gun, loading another bullet into the chamber. ]
lennon: [translates] don't shoot! Lower your weapons!
[lennon walks towards sawyer then stops. Sawyer is aiming his gun at lennon. ]
lennon: please, you don't have to do this. We won't hurt your friend.
Sawyer: [looking at sayid] he ain't my friend. Do what you want with him and anybody else. But me, i'm walking out of here.
[kate walks forward. Sawyer is aiming at her. ]
kate: james.
Sawyer: i'm gone! You understand?
[sawyer maintains aiming the gun as he lifts beams of wood that are barricading the large wooden doors. ]
temple leader: please. [pause] you have to stay.
Sawyer: [angered] no, i don't.
[sawyer opens the wooden door and exits the courtyard. ]
sawyer: [to kate] don't come after me.
[sawyer closes the door behind him. ]
act 2
[two men drag sayid away. The temple leader follows as does lennon. ]
temple leader: jarrah wa hikiuketa [] nani wo shitemo kamawan [] ford wo tsuremodose. []
[two men are restraining jack. He struggles to get out of their grasp, unsuccessfully. Two other men drag miles away through a different passageway. ]
jack: hey! Hey! Where are they taking sayid.
[another man shouts over everyone. He aims a handgun at jack. ]
aldo: hey! Calm down! Everybody calm down.
Lennon: [to jack] where'd ford go?
Jack: what?
Lennon: ford, your friend who just ran outta here. Where did he go?
Jack: i don't know.
Lennon: do you expect me to believe that?
Jack: he told me he wanted to kill me. You believe that?
Kate: i can bring him back.
Lennon: you know where he went?
Kate: no, but i can track him. Let me go. I will bring him back and i can make him stay.
Jack: kate, you sure you want to go out there alone with these people?
Jin: i'll go with her.
Lennon: it's very important that he get back here safely. What makes you think he's going to listen to you?
Kate: i can be very convincing when i wanna be.
[flash sideways - kate speeds the cab to a repair shop. She stops and quickly gets out. A radio is playing indistinctly in the background. The sound of a man is using a grinding/sanding tool drowns out the music. Sparks are flying about as kate enters the garage aiming the gun at the repairman. The man stops working and takes off his goggles. ]
kate: where's your tire hammer?
Repairman: you've got a problem.
Kate: so do you. Where's your tire hammer?
Repairman: tire hammer will just cut off your wrist. The problem is you need a punch press and you're not gonna be able to use one of them and keep that gun pointed at me.
Kate: you volunteering?
Repairman: i got a steady hand but i kinda feel like we got off on the wrong foot.
Kate: i'll give you two hundred dollars.
[the scene changes to a table where kate has the handcuffs steady and the repairman has the tip of a punch press in the ring that holds the cuff together. ]
repairman: now hold still.
[the repairman applies pressure and the handcuffs come off. Kate tosses them in the trash. ]
kate: thanks.
Repairman: so why the bracelets?
Kate: i'm wanted for murder.
Repairman: murder?
Kate: you don't happen to have somewhere i can change, do you?
Repairman: [laughs and points. ] bathroom's over there. Make it quick.
Kate: thank you.
[kate turns and walks toward the bathroom and stops in a back room. She takes off her jacket and opens the tote bag that belonged to claire. As she unzips it she sees a polaroid picture of claire, smiling, holding and pointing to her pregnant belly. Kate picks up the picture and stares. Everything she takes out is for a baby, wash cloths, bottle, and a stuffed whale toy which she stares at. She puts it down and runs her hand through her hair as she looks in a mirror. A faint sound, similar to a time skip is heard. ]
[on-island - at the temple. Kate is packing her backpack as aldo walks up and hands her a canteen. ]
aldo: better not slow us down.
Kate: [quietly] better not slow me down.
[jin looks at kate as he finishes packing his backpack. Kate zippers her backpack closed. Jack walks over and sits next to kate. ]
jack: i'd go with you but..
Kate: ... But you thought he would kill you?
[jack shrugs his shoulders and chuckles. ]
kate: i'll take care of james. You take care of sayid.
Jack: [nods] deal.
[they all stand up. Jin exits the chamber first. As kate walks away jack grabs her arm. She stops. ]
kate: good bye.
Jack: be careful.
[jack looks kate in the eye. She turns and walks out of the chamber. ]
[the scene switches to another chamber. Sayid is strapped down on a examination table with his shirt pulled to expose his chest and abdominal area. He has a leather strap buckled to keep his head still. The temple leader opens a canister of powder and walks over to sayid. He blows some of the powder over sayid's chest and abdomen. He watches for a reaction. ]
sayid: what is it you want? Please, whatever you are thinking of doing [pause] what is that?
[sayid is frightened as he watches the temple leader bring three exposed wires and attaches one to each nipple and a third to his abdomen. ]
sayid: just tell me what you want.
[the temple leader walks over to an apparatus with a handle and begins to crank it. When he stops cranking, he flips a switch and a red light shines. He looks at sayid then turns a knob quickly. Sayid is being shocked. His body quivers as he grinds his teeth. The temple leader then turns the knob fully. As sayid begins to scream, the leader shuts off the apparatus and removes the electrical leads. ]
sayid: [whimpering] why? Why are you doing this?
[the leader does not respond. He rubs the receptacle that is hanging around his neck then walks to a fire pit and twists a metal arrow in the fire then removes it and walks back to sayid. ]
sayid: i don't have any secrets. Ask, ahhh!
[the leader places the hot iron to sayid's wound. Sayid screams in agony. ]
sayid: ahhhhh! [sobs] ahhh! [raises he shoulders from the table and cries out. The leader pays close attention to sayid's reaction. The leader pulls the iron from sayid who falls back onto the table. ]
sayid: ugh! Ugh! ! Ugh!
Temple leader: yoshi, korede juubun da [] shiken ni tootta to ie [you can tell him from me to "you passed the test". ]
[sayid is crying. Lennon motions for two men to come to the table as he unbuckles the restraints holding sayid. ]
lennon: we're sorry we had to put you through that. It was a test. We had to be sure.
Sayid: test to be sure of what?
Lennon: don't worry. You passed.
[the two men help sayid from the table and escort him from the chamber. ]
lennon: i just lied to him, didn't i?
Temple leader: yes.
[the leader returns to writing at his desk. ]
act 3
[flash sideways - kate pulls the cab to the curb where claire is sitting on a bench. Kate gets out of the cab and walks over to claire. ]
kate: where were you going?
Claire: what?
Kate: before i got in the cab, where were you going?
Claire: why, so you can hijack them too?
[kate takes claire's purse and tote from the trunk of the cab and gives them to claire. ]
claire: i was waiting for a bus.
Kate: i came to bring you your stuff.
[claire immediately looks in her purse. ]
kate: relax, i didn't take your money.
Claire: well, uh, gee, thanks.
Kate: so where were you going?
[claire stands up and starts to walk away. ]
claire: don't worry about it.
Kate: fine.
[kate closes the trunk then walks back around the cab and starts to get in the driver's side. Claire watches as she closes the trunk. ]
claire: langdon street. Brentwood.
Kate: you got family there?
Claire: uh, no. It's the couple who's adopting my baby. [pause] they were, um, they were meant to meet me at the airport but i guess they got their days mixed up or something. It's not like they abandoned me.
Kate: brentwood's not far. Get in.
Claire: [scoffs] seriously?
Kate: do you want a ride or not?
[claire is unsure however she slowly gets in the front seat of the cab. ]
[on-island - in the jungle, kate, jin, justin and aldo are hiking to get sawyer back to the temple. ]
kate: so why do you people want us to stay at the temple?
Aldo: we're protecting you.
Kate: from what?
Aldo: you've been on this island for a while, right? Ever see a big pillar of black smoke, makes a ticka ticka sound, looks pissed off?
Kate: yes.
Aldo: from that.
Jin: do you know anything about another plane coming in? An ajira flight.
Aldo: i'm sorry. Is this a press conference?
Justin: i think he means the one that landed...
Aldo: justin! Shut up.
[justin stops speaking, looks at aldo and continues walking. Jin looks at justin and continues to walk. Kate is crouched down looking at two trails. ]
kate: no, no, no, that's a decoy trail. He went this way.
Aldo: and you're basing this on what?
Kate: [firmly] experience.
Justin: aldo.
Aldo: what?
Justin: i think she's right.
Aldo: [sarcastically] of course she is.
[kate begins walking. ]
aldo: after you, princess. [pause] so what's your strategy for bringing your boyfriend back? I hope you got one because he shot a guy on his way out. If he tries that on me, i'm gonna blow his head off.
[kate drinks from her canteen and continues walking. Justin immediately stops her. ]
justin: watch it!
[kate looks down and sees a trip wire made from a tree branch. She takes a deep breath. ]
kate: thank you.
[they all look up to see a net full of rocks hanging from a tree. ]
jin: looks like one of rousseau's traps.
Justin: the french woman? She's been dead for years. This, this couldn't be one ...
Aldo: justin! Shut up!
[kate walks up to aldo and shoves her canteen into his chest. ]
kate: what was he gonna say?
Aldo: you don't even remember me, do you? You don't recognize me? Well maybe this will jog you memory. Three years ago, you staged yourself a little prison break, [kate drinks from her canteen] and you did it by knocking the guard out with the butt of your rifle. That would be me.
[kate takes a swing at aldo's head with her canteen and he falls to the ground. Justin takes a step toward kate. She throws her canteen at the trip wire/branch and hits it. The netting holding the rocks comes down and swings to one side. On the return swing it opens and the rocks come falling down onto justin. Kate grabs aldo's gun from the ground, checks to see how many rounds are in the magazine, and puts the magazine back into the gun handle then picks up justin's rifle. ]
jin: what are you doing?
Kate: escaping.
[back at the temple chamber with the spring. Two men are dragging sayid. Hurley rushes to sayid and they give him sayid. ]
hurley: sayid! You okay, man? Jack! He's back!
[sayid grunts as he collapses into hurley and miles' arms. They sit him down and lean his back on a stone pillar. Sayid groans in pain. ]
jack: sayid, what happened?
Sayid: they tortured me.
Jack: why?
Sayid: don't know. They didn't ask me any questions.
[jack leaves sayid with hurley and miles. He walks briskly and stops in front of a doorway that is guarded by 2 armed men. ]
jack: step aside.
[the two men allow jack to pass. ]
[the scene switches to a chamber where temple leader is using a mortar and pestle. Jack enters the chamber. The temple leader stops for a moment. Lennon is off to the side near a bookcase. He is standing with an open book in his right hand. ]
lennon: hey, shephard.
[lennon closes the book at walks toward the temple leader. ]
lennon: we were hoping you'd come on your own.
[jack points back to the water chamber. ]
jack: what the hell did you do to sayid?
Lennon: we, we didn't do anything to him. Your, your friend is sick.
Jack: sick with what?
Temple leader: kare wa kegasarete shimatta [[1]]
lennon: he's [pause] yeah, i, [pause] not really [pause] there's not really a literal translation. The closest thing would be [pause] infected.
Jack: infected? He's not even running a fever.
[the temple leader chuckles and continues work. Jack walks to the leader. ]
jack: did i say something funny?
Lennon: i doubt it. He doesn't really have a sense of humor.
[the temple leader smiles and wraps a capsule in a piece of paper. ]
temple leader: korewo jarrah ni nomasete moraou[you have to give jarrah this pill. ]
lennon: he says you have to give your friend this pill.
Jack: [laughs] are you serious?
[the paper with the capsule is again offered to jack. ]
jack: why don't you give it to him?
Lennon: because it won't work unless he takes it willingly, and he won't take it willingly from us.
Jack: well, then maybe you should've asked him to take it before you tortured him.
Lennon: we didn't torture him. We were diagnosing him.
Jack: to see if he was infected.
Lennon: yes.
Jack: i'm not gonna give anything to sayid unless i know what's in it.
[jack starts to walk out the chamber. Lennon starts to follow him but is stopped by the leader. ]
temple leader: tell me, shephard, your friend, how did he get shot?
Jack: he was, um, he was helping me.
Temple leader: so it was your fault?
Jack: yes.
Temple leader: and there have been others who were hurt or died, helping you?
Jack: yes.
Temple leader: [nods] well, this is your chance to redeem yourself.
[the leader takes jack's left hand, places the paper with the capsule in it, then closes jack's hand. ]
temple leader: it's medicine and your friend needs it.
Jack: what happens if i don't give it to him?
Temple leader: the infection will spread.
Act 4
[back in the spring chamber, miles and hurley are sitting with sayid. ]
miles: so, nothing? There wasn't anything? No white light? Angels singing? No dead relatives?
Sayid: i remember being shot.
Hurley: you're not a zombie, right?
Sayid: no. I am not a zombie.
[footsteps approach the three men. Miles turns to see jack. ]
miles: hey.
[jack reaches for a canteen and takes a drink. ]
jack: mind giving me and sayid a minute?
Hurley: yeah, see, private talks kinda freak me out 'cause they lead me to having to do something i don't quite understand.
Jack: i'm right there with you.
Miles: its fine. We'll be in the food court if you need us.
[miles and hurley walk away from jack and sayid. Jack sits and takes a drink from a canteen. He offers the canteen to sayid who motions no. ]
sayid: so did they tell you why they burnt me with a hot poker?
Jack: they said they were trying to diagnose you.
Sayid: right. They told me it was some sort of test which they said i passed. Clearly, i didn't.
[jack unfolds the paper and exposes the capsule. ]
sayid: what's that?
Jack: they want you to take it. It's medicine, according to them.
Sayid: what about according to you?
Jack: i don't know. And you know, before when you [pause] when you thanked me for saving your life, i, i didn't have anything to do with it sayid. I didn't fix you. They did.
[jack takes the capsule in his right palm. ]
sayid: i don't care who fixed me. I only care about who i trust. So, if you want me to take that pill, jack, i'll do it.
[jack looks at the capsule, closes his hand and looks at sayid. ]
[in the jungle, kate walks in front of jin. ]
jin: wait. Where are you going?
Kate: catching up with sawyer.
Jin: so you never planned to bring him back to the temple.
Kate: no. I'm not interested in being a prisoner. Are you?
Jin: where did your plane land, kate?
Kate: what?
[kate stops, turns around and walks back to jin. ]
jin: the ajira plane that you, jack and hurley came in on. [pause] where did it land?
Kate: i don't know.
Jin: sun was on that plane too and i have to find her.
Kate: [angry] you think they're gonna tell you? You think they care about you or about sun or about any of us?
Jin: who do you care about kate?
Kate: good luck, jin.
[kate turns and walks away from jin. ]
jin: once you catch up with sawyer, then what?
Kate: i guess we'll figure that out together.
[flash sideways - kate is driving claire in the cab to brentwood. ]
claire: so, uh, what happened to your handcuffs?
Kate: i cut them off.
[claire nods and says nothing. There is silence between the two women. ]
claire: it's a beautiful neighborhood. [pause] i bet they're a really nice couple.
[kate looks over at claire who is smiling then continues to drive. ]
claire: what?
Kate: i didn't say anything.
Claire: what, you, you think they didn't come to the airport on purpose?
Kate: why would i think that?
Claire: good, 'cause they didn't.
[claire tries to keep a straight face. Kate looks over to her right. ]
kate: this is it.
[the house has a large landscaped front yard. There are various shrubs and trees close to the building. It has a large, double door entryway. Claire unbuckles her seat belt. Kate goes to hand her the paper with the address. ]
claire: um, will you come in with me?
Kate: [unsure] are you kidding me?
Claire: please, i just [pause] i really don't want to go up there on my own.
[kate looks at claire. The scene changes to the front door of the house being opened by a blonde woman. ]
claire: uh, hi, um, mrs. Baskum? I, i'm, i'm claire little ton.
[the woman looks at claire's belly. ]
mrs. Baskum: [voice cracks] oh, my god. [sighs and sobs] i'm so sorry. Um, [pause] my husband [looks away then looks back] he left me. [crying] and, believe me, i wanted a baby so much, but i can't do it alone. I'm sorry. Look, i know i should've called you.
Claire: so uh, wh-what, y-y-you just changed your mind?
Mrs. Baskum: um, look, my, my life is just, a little bit complicated right now.
[claire is very upset. Kate has been watching claire and the way mrs. Baskum has been treating her. ]
kate: [angry] she came all the way from australia and you don't call?
Claire: oh my god.
[claire grabs her belly and begins to groan. ]
kate: [to claire] are you okay?
Claire: aah! It's coming!
[on-island - kate exits the jungle at the barracks. She readies her gun. The picket fence is broken in places. The swings move in the breeze. Some of the barracks look abandoned and others look intact. Kate walks around then hears noise from one of the barracks. She goes to investigate. The noise continues. She enters the home of sawyer and juliet. Carefully she moves about trying to find the source of the noise. She stops at the door to the bedroom. Sawyer has moved a dresser to the side and is prying open the floorboards with a crowbar. He retrieves a shoe box then sits on the foot of the bed. He brushes off the dust and opens the box. He takes out a very small black drawstring bag. He cries as he holds it ever so tightly. Kate watches. As she turns and walks away, the floorboards creak and sawyer is standing up in a flash, cocking and aiming the gun at the door. ]
sawyer: who's there? Better come out now or so help me, i'm just gonna start shootin'.
[sawyer is in the hallway, lowering his gun when he sees kate. ]
sawyer: what the hell are you doin' here?
Kate: i was worried about you.
[kate turns to face sawyer. Sawyer angrily and quickly walks past her, and doesn't look at her. Kate turns and watches him leave the house. ]
act 5
[flash sideways - kate speeds to the emergency room entrance of a hospital and gets out of the cab. She secures the gun in the back of her pants. Kate runs around to the other side of the cab and helps claire out of the back seat. A nurse with a wheelchair stops next to them. ]
nurse: what's happening here?
Claire: i-i think i'm having contractions.
Nurse: when did they start?
Claire: um, about three minutes ago.
Nurse: try to relax. We're gonna take you to the m. C. U to get it looked at.
[kate follows with claire's purse and tote bag. She sees a police car turning the corner. ]
nurse: [to kate] are you with her?
Kate: yeah.
Nurse: okay, follow me.
[claire is in a hospital bed and a different nurse is attempting to get a blood pressure cuff on her. Claire is quite upset. A monitor is beeping. ]
claire: what are you doing? What, what's going on?
Nurse 2: hold on. The doctor will be with you in just a moment.
Claire: i need to know what's going on? Is something wrong?
[kate leaves the ob triage and locates a doctor. ]
kate: excuse me. Excuse me.
Doctor goodspeed: yes.
Kate: are you a doctor?
Doctor goodspeed: yes. I'm dr. Goodspeed.
Kate: can i please get your help in here?
[kate and dr. Goodspeed go back into the ob triage. A monitor is beeping rapidly. Dr. Goodspeed reads claire's chart. ]
doctor goodspeed: miss littleton? Claire, how are you feeling?
Claire: uncomfortable. What, wh-what's happening.
Doctor goodspeed: what's happening is that mother nature's gotten a little ahead of herself. Are you ready to have your baby?
Claire: i-i'm sorry. What? !
Doctor goodspeed: you're at thirty six weeks, three centimeters dilated and about 80% effaced, which means, if you want, you can have your baby tonight.
Claire: if i want? So what, you mean, you mean you can stop it then?
Doctor goodspeed: maybe. However, to do that would require a number of drugs.
Claire: drugs? I mean. W-will that hurt the baby?
Doctor goodspeed: no. They're perfectly safe. I just don't want to stick you with needles if i don't have to. So it's up to you.
Claire: i'm, i'm not ready.
Doctor goodspeed: okay. Let's get her started on the nifedipine drip.
[the monitor emits a steady tone. Kate stops looking at dr. Goodspeed and quickly looks at claire. ]
claire: wh, what, what is it?
Doctor goodspeed: [to nurse 2] margaret, let's do an ultrasound. I wanna get a picture of what's going on in there. [to claire] ah, it, it could just mean the baby's out of position.
Claire: wh-wh-what are you, what are you saying? ! W-what, what's happening to my baby? ! [crying] is my baby okay? Is aaron okay?
[kate looks at claire with eyes wide open as dr. Goodspeed takes the ultrasound detector and puts gel on and moves it along on claire's baby. ]
doctor goodspeed: see? [chuckles] there he is. Everything is just fine. [monitor returns to beeping. ] your boy just likes to move around.
[claire and the doctor chuckle as kate stands confused a bit. ]
doctor goodspeed: 140 b. P. M, perfectly normal. I have a feeling that aaron is gonna be a handful.
[claire chuckles. ]
doctor goodspeed: now let's see if we can slow this down.
[claire nods. ]
doctor goodspeed: you did great, mommy. Thanks.
[claire smiles at kate, who is holding her hand. ]
[sawyer is sitting on the end of the dock at the barracks. He sighs. Kate walks up sits next to him. ]
kate: a couple days ago, you asked me why i came back to the island. [pause] i need to find claire. I thought [pause] maybe if i could catch up to you, you could help me, and then [pause] maybe if we could find her and bring her back to aaron, then maybe all of this wouldn't be for nothing.
[sawyer exhales deeply. ]
kate: i'm sorry. I never should have followed you.
Sawyer: which time?
Kate: [pointing] that was your house, right? With juliet.
Sawyer: [holding back tears] yep.
Kate: i'm sorry.
Sawyer: you already said that.
Kate: no [pause] for juliet. If i hadn't come after you on the sub, then you two would've left and she would've never died.
Sawyer: it's not your fault she's dead. It's mine. [eye welling with tears] she was sittin' right there, right where you are now, tryin' to leave this place. And i convinced her to stay. I made her stay on this island [crying] 'cause i didn't want to be alone. [deep breath] you understand that, right?
[sawyer and kate just look at each other. ]
sawyer: but, uh, [pause] but i think some of us are meant to be alone.
[sawyer is rubbing a diamond ring with his fingers. ]
sawyer: i was gonna ask her to marry me.
[kate looks away. She was not expecting this from sawyer. Still crying, sawyer stands up on the pier and throws the ring into the water as kate watches. ]
sawyer: you can probably make it back to the temple by nightfall.
[sawyer walks back along the pier. Kate begins to cry. ]
[back in the temple leader's chamber. He is sitting at his desk spinning a baseball on top. Jack enters the chamber. ]
jack: what's that?
Temple leader: it's a baseball.
[jack sits in a chair in front of the desk. ]
jack: you speak pretty good english for someone who needs a translator.
Temple leader: we both know that i don't need a translator.
Jack: then why do you have one?
Temple leader: because i have to remain separate from the people i'm in charge of. It makes it easier when they don't like the decisions i make for them.
Jack: who are you?
Dogen: my name is dogen.
Jack: are you from here, the island?
Dogen: i was brought here like everyone else.
Jack: what do you mean, "brought here. "?
Dogen: you know exactly what i mean.
[jack stands up and walks away from the desk. Dogen gets up also. ]
dogen: you didn't give your friend the pill, did you?
Jack: no.
Dogen: why not?
Jack: because i don't know what's in it.
Dogen: it will eliminate--
jack: [interrupts] --the infection, yeah. I got that. But what's in it?
Dogen: i cannot explain.
Jack: try.
Dogen: there isn't any time. He'll die if you don't...
Jack: [smugly interrupts] he already died. [hold pill] what is in it?
Dogen: [sigh] you just have to trust me.
Jack: [chuckles] i don't trust myself. How am i supposed to trust you? Let's see where trust gets us.
[jack swallows the pill. Dogen quickly rushes jack and full palm, slaps him in the stomach. With his hand still on jack's chest, he pounds on his back, twice. He then puts his foot in front of jack's, puts his other hand around jack and with both hands pushes up on jack's stomach. He gets jack to cough up the pill which he immediately picks up. Gasping, jack tries to catch his breath. ]
jack: now, are you gonna tell me what's in it?
Dogen: poison.
Act 6
[flash sideways - claire is looking at a picture from her ultrasound. The date on the picture is 10/22/2004. There is a knock on the door. A faint voice is heard over the pa system. ]
claire: come in.
Detective rasmussen. : excuse me. Ms. Littleton?
Claire: um, yeah.
Detective rasmussen: i'm detective rasmussen.
[a police officer walks in with the detective. ]
detective rasmussen: is ms. Hart here?
Claire: uh, i'm sorry. Who?
Detective rasmussen: joan hart. She signed in with you.
[the police officer is taking a look around the room. There are indistinct voices from his radio. ]
claire: oh. She was just the, um, the cab driver. I needed help and she brought me up here. She left after they treated me, though.
[the officer looks at a door and walks away. Kate is hiding in the room behind the door. ]
detective rasmussen: she, uh, give you any indication where she was headed?
Claire: why? Is there something wrong?
Detective rasmussen: no. It's nothing for you to worry about. [to officer] come on. Let's go.
[they leave the room. As the door closes, kate exits the small room. The sign on the door reads, no admittance authorized personnel only. ]
pa voice: ekg tech 3-1-5. Ekg tech 3-1-5.
Kate: thanks.
Claire: sure. Thank you. Why, why are they after you? What, what did you do?
Kate: would you believe me if i said i was innocent?
Claire: yeah. Yeah, i would.
Kate: [smiles] well, i should go.
Claire: oh, wait. Um, here, take my credit card.
Kate: no.
Claire: there's not much of a limit on it but it's something.
Kate: you don't have to do this.
Claire: you didn't have to do what you did either.
[claire and kate smile as kate takes the credit card. ]
kate: aaron's a great name.
Claire: i don't know why i said it. It's like, i don't know. I knew it or something.
Kate: i think you should keep him.
Claire: well, um, good luck.
Kate: yeah, you too.
Claire: thanks.
[on-island - kate is filling up her canteen from the outside faucet of one of the barracks. She looks back over her right shoulder and sees sawyer walking with his head lowered. He walks by kate as if she wasn't there. Kate watches and he continues to walk back into the house that he once lived in with juliet and closes the door. Kate takes her backpack and walks out of the barracks. ]
[in dogen's chamber, he is pouring two cups of tea. ]
lennon: he swallowed it?
Dogen: yes.
[dogen takes the cups of tea and places one cup on the table in front of jack where jack is holding his stomach. ]
jack: what's this?
Dogen: tea.
[jack chuckles. Dogen takes a sip from his cup then jack reaches for his cup. ]
jack: why would you people want to kill sayid?
[dogen looks at jack then lennon and back to jack. ]
dogen: we believe he has been [pause] mesarete itandarou[to ascend to heaven].
Lennon: closest translation is "claimed. "
jack: claimed [long pause] by what?
Dogen: there is a darkness growing in him and once it reaches his heart, everything your friend once was, will be gone.
Jack: no uh. How can you be sure of that?
Dogen: because it happened to your sister.
[jack looks at dogen, lennon and back to dogen. ]
[in the jungle, jin stops by a stream, puts his rifle down and crouches down to get a drink of the water. Before he can take a drink, he is yanked from behind by aldo and justin. ]
aldo: get up!
[aldo brings his knee up to jin's face. ]
aldo: that's for my head.
[aldo pushes jin into a tree, cocks his gun and aims at jin. ]
aldo: now, where's that bitch?
Jin: i don't know. You don't understand. I'm going back to the temple.
Aldo: yeah, right.
Justin: it looks like he's alone. Maybe we should take him back.
Aldo: or maybe we didn't find him alive.
Justin: aldo, no. We can't. He's one of them.
Aldo: [turns to justin] he may be one of them.
[jin tries to run away. Aldo and justin run after him. ]
aldo: hey! Hey!
[jin steps into a bear trap and falls to the ground. It is clamped around his ankle. ]
jin: aah! Ugh!
[jin groans as he grabs at the trap. Justin sees jin and stops but has his rifle aimed at jin. Aldo walks up from behind. ]
aldo: [smugly] where you goin'?
[aldo laughs as he aims his gun at jin ready to fire. Before he can there are two gunshots and the target is aldo. He falls to the ground, dead. Jin looks around. Another shot is heard. The target is justin. He falls to the ground. ]
justin: ughh!
[frightened, jin looks to find who is shooting. He is still trapped. He looks up and to see a blonde woman holding a rifle. He tries to get a better look. ]
jin: claire?
[it is claire. She is wearing a blue plaid shirt, hair disheveled with smudges of dirt on her cheeks. She just looks at jin. ]
act 1
[flash sideways - a large van navigates a suburban street bustling with activity. The van pulls into a driveway and the side door slides open. ]
[mechanical whirring. ]
[a platform folds out and john locke wheels himself on to it. He presses a lever that lowers the platform. The platform sputters as it grinds to a halt. ]
john: oh, come on...
[john sighs, then musters his courage and attempts to roll off the platform and onto the lawn. He grunts as he falls face down, his wheelchair collapsing beside him. Then, the sprinklers come on. ]
helen: john?
[helen comes out the front door of the house and shuts off the sprinklers. ]
helen: are you okay?
[she runs to his side and kneels down next to him. ]
john: yeah... I'm fine.
Helen: come on, let's... Let's get you inside.
John: okay.
[some time later, john sits in the bath tub. ]
helen: well how long will that take?
[helen, off camera, is on the phone. ]
helen: the wedding is in october. Look, i'm just gonna have to call you back. Yeah.
[helen enters the washroom. ]
helen: i am so sick of caterers... And bands and... Picking fabrics for chair backs. What do you say we just get my parents and your dad and do it shotgun style in vegas?
John: no, you deserve better than that, helen. We can do this. I know we can.
[john contemplates the fabric swatches he is holding. ]
john: i like... This one.
[he indicates a green swatch. ]
helen: that one?
John: i meant this one.
[he indicates a blue swatch. ]
helen: you are a very sweet man.
[they kiss. ]
john: i know.
Helen: so? How was the conference?
John: boring.
[helen takes a card out of john's pocket. ]
helen: who's uh... Who's dr. Jack shephard?
John: oh. I met him at lost luggage when i went to fill out the forms. He... He lost something too.
Helen: he's a spinal surgeon?
John: yeah. Nice guy. He offered me a free consult.
Helen: you should call him.
John: aw, he was just bein' polite, helen.
Helen: so what? I mean... What are the odds of you just running into a spinal surgeon? I mean, who knows? Maybe it's destiny.
John: maybe it is.
[on-island - the sounds of the monster are heard as the camera soars over treetops and slithers along creek beds. It pauses as it examines a house in the dharma barracks from which breaking glass and rock music can be heard. Moving through the jungle once more, the form of john locke emerges and picks up a discarded machete. He approaches what looks like a large bag suspended in midair by a rope. He severs the rope with the machete and lowers the bag to the ground. Richard alpert crawls out. ]
locke: alright, richard. Time to talk.
Act 2
[electronic ding. ]
[flash sideways - john locke exits the elevator and wheels across a crowded office and into his cubicle. ]
randy: welcome back, colonel. Wow. You got a nice tan in australia. Did you miss us?
John: sure i did, randy.
Randy: so? How was the conference, john?
John: it was okay. I didn't really learn anything.
Randy: no?
John: but um... I made some good contacts, though.
Randy: really? That's interesting. See uh... Ken fisher called and said you had to cancel your lunch with him.
John: right, right... I was a little under the weather that day. Probably jet lag.
Randy: really? 'cause then the seminar people called and said you hadn't picked up your credentials. I did some checking... And it seems you didn't attend a single event. Since we sent you to sydney on the company's dime... Where the hell were you?
John: look, randy... I'm really sorry. Why don't we just call it my vacation week?
Randy: i thought you wanted that vacation week in october. You know, for your wedding.
John: please, randy... Look, i know i shouldn't have lied. But where i was... It's personal. And i... And i really don't want to talk about it.
Randy: okay, john. Hey... You're fired.
[randy does a mocking salute and walks away. ]
[on-island - locke kneels next to richard and offers him a canteen. ]
locke: thirsty?
[richard drinks deeply. ]
locke: richard, i'm sorry i hit you in the throat and dragged you off the beach but i had to do something.
Richard: what do you want?
Locke: what i've always wanted. For you to come with me.
Richard: why do you look like john locke?
Locke: i knew he'd get me access to jacob. Because john's a candidate. Or at least he was a candidate...
[they both stand. ]
richard: what do you mean? What do you mean a candidate?
Locke: didn't jacob tell you any of this?
Richard: any of what?
Locke: oh, richard... I'm sorry. You mean, you've been doing everything he told you all this time and he never said why?
[richard does not reply. ]
locke: i would never have done that to you. I would never have kept you in the dark.
Richard: and what would you have done?
Locke: i would have treated you with respect. Come with me... And i promise i will tell you everything.
Richard: no.
Locke: are you sure about that, richard? Because people seldom get a second chance...
Richard: i'm not going anywhere with you.
Locke: alright, i'll--
[locke sees a blond boy with bloodied arms standing in the jungle. Richard cannot see him. ]
richard: what?
Locke: i'll be seeing you, richard. Sooner than you think.
[locke walks into the jungle. ]
[in the foot of the statue, ben approaches ilana, who is weeping near the bodies of her friends. ]
ben: am i interrupting?
[ilana wipes at her eyes. ]
ilana: tell me what happened to them.
Ben: alright. But there's a fairly reasonable chance that you won't believe me...
[ilana stands and walks over to him. ]
ilana: try me.
Ben: john locke killed them.
Ilana: all by himself?
Ben: yes. He turned into a pillar of black smoke and killed them right before my eyes.
Ilana: did he kill jacob as well?
Ben: yes...
Ilana: then where's his body?
Ben: locke kicked him into the fire and he burned away.
[ilana approaches the fire pit and begins scooping the ashes into a pouch. ]
ben: locke... Do you know why he carried richard into the jungle?
Ilana: he's recruiting.
[locke marches through the dharma barracks. He enters the house he had passed earlier, from which loud music continues to blare. The house is in shambles, he walks by the record player and finds sawyer drinking on the floor in the bedroom. ]
locke: hello, james.
Sawyer: i thought you were dead.
Locke: i am.
Act 3
[sawyer pours two large glasses of whiskey. He hands one to locke as he enters the living room and sits on the couch. ]
sawyer: here's to being dead.
[he drinks his whiskey. ]
locke: you're taking this extremely well.
Sawyer: taking what extremely well?
Locke: that i'm here.
Sawyer: i don't give a damn if you're dead. Or time travellin' or... The ghost of christmas past. All i care about is this whiskey. So bottoms up! Get the hell out of my house.
[locke puts his whiskey down. ]
locke: this isn't your house, james.
Sawyer: the hell it ain't...
Locke: no. You just lived here for awhile. This was never your house.
Sawyer: who are you? 'cause you sure as hell ain't john locke.
Locke: what makes you say that?
Sawyer: 'cause locke was scared. Even when he was pretendin' he wasn't. But you? You ain't scared.
Locke: what if i told you i was the person who could answer the most important question in the world?
[sawyer laughs. ]
sawyer: and what question is that?
Locke: why are you on this island?
Sawyer: i'm on this island because my plane crashed. Because my raft blew up. Because the helicopter i was on was ridin' one too heavy.
Locke: that's not why you're here. And if you come with me, i can prove it.
Sawyer: well, i guess i better put some pants on.
[flash sideways - john wheels towards his van in the parking lot with a box of his belongings in his lap. He finds a yellow hummer parked next to him, preventing him from boarding his van via the platform. ]
john: okay! Okay!
[he uses a remote to activate the platform, hoping to strike the hummer with it, but it fails again. ]
john: come on!
[he throws his remote to the ground and bangs on the hummer until the alarm sounds. Hurley comes running and shuts it off. ]
hurley: dude! Dude! What are you doin'?
John: what am i doin'? What the hell are you doin'? Did you ever park a car in your life? You're practically in my spot!
Hurley: i'm sorry...
John: yeah...
Hurley: but... You know, there's a handicapped spot right over here.
[hurley indicates a vacant handicapped spot right next to john's van. ]
john: yeah? Yeah, okay... But i don't have to park there! I can park anywhere i want! You need to stay inside the lines!
Hurley: i'm really sorry. They were supposed to reserve a spot for me, so... You know, i just... Parked here.
[john sighs. ]
john: i haven't seen you before. Do you work here?
Hurley: actually, i own the company.
[they chuckle. ]
hurley: hugo reyes.
John: john locke.
[they shake hands. ]
hurley: cool. What do you do here, john?
John: actually... Nothing. My boss just fired me.
Hurley: oh? Who's your boss?
John: his name is randy. But uh--
hurley: randy nations?
John: yeah.
Hurley: yeah... That guy is a huge douche. Want me to talk to him for you?
John: no. That's okay...
Hurley: tell you what, john. I own a temp agency too...
[hurley takes a pen and paper from john's box and begins writing. ]
hurley: call this number and tell them that hugo said to hook you up with a new job, pronto.
[he hands john the pen and paper. ]
hurley: and chin up. Things are gonna work out.
[on-island - on the beach, frank covers locke's body with a tarp. ]
lapidus: he's gettin' pretty ripe!
[ilana exits the foot of the statue. ]
ilana: where is everybody?
Sun: they left. They said they were going to the temple.
Ilana: right now, that's the safest place on the island. We should go there too.
Sun: are you alright?
Ilana: i'm fine. Come on, let's get out of here!
Sun: what makes you think that i'm going with you?
Ilana: because... You want to find jin.
Sun: what do you know about my husband?
Ilana: i know that if he's on the island... And if he's alive... Then he'll be at the temple. Let's get moving!
[ilana begins to walk away. ]
sun: what about john? We need to bury him.
[in the jungle, sawyer follows locke. ]
locke: what were you doing alone in that house, james?
Sawyer: drinkin'.
Locke: where are the rest of your friends?
Sawyer: some temple somewhere...
Locke: why aren't you with 'em?
Sawyer: you know what? How 'bout we just don't talk?
Locke: you got it.
[sawyer sees the blond boy standing in the jungle. Locke sees him too. ]
sawyer: who the hell's that?
Locke: you can see him?
Sawyer: the kid? Hell yeah i can see him.
[the boy begins to run. ]
locke: hey!
[locke chases him but trips on a root and falls. The boy stands over him. ]
boy: you know the rules. You can't kill him.
Locke: don't tell me what i can't do...
[the boy shakes his head and walks away. ]
locke: don't tell me what i can't do!
Act 4
[sawyer stands alone in the jungle. ]
sawyer: locke! Locke! Look, whoever you are, you got about twenty seconds and then i'm outta here!
[richard walks out of the jungle. ]
richard: where is he?
Sawyer: what the hell are you doin' here?
Richard: where is he?
Sawyer: locke? He ran off into the jungle after some kid.
Richard: we need to go! Now!
Sawyer: go where?
Richard: to the temple! Let's go! Let's go!
Sawyer: you know what? I've been to the temple and i think i'm stickin' with locke.
Richard: that man is not john locke!
Sawyer: i know.
Richard: then why are you with him?
Sawyer: because he's got answers. He says he knows why i'm on this island. Unless you wanna tell me why i'm here, richard...
Richard: don't be naive! He's not gonna tell you anthing, he's gonna kill you!
Sawyer: if he wanted to kill me he could have done it a dozen times already...
Richard: you don't understand what you're dealing with! He doesn't just want you dead, he wants everyone dead! Everyone you care about! All of 'em! And he won't stop--
[richard hears footsteps in the jungle and runs away. Locke enters the clearing. ]
locke: who were you talking to?
Sawyer: nobody. You ever catch up to the kid?
Locke: what kid?
Sawyer: right... Let's get on with it, shall we?
Locke: yes, james. Let's get on with it.
[they move on. ]
[flash sideways - john locke sits in front a desk across from a woman. ]
woman: what kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
John: excuse me?
Woman: what kind of animal would you describe yourself as?
John: what uh... I don't know what that has to do with--
woman: just say whatever comes to mind.
[john does not reply. ]
woman: would you describe yourself as a people person?
[john sighs. ]
john: may i speak to your supervisor?
Woman: of course. I'll go get her.
[the woman walks away. Rose approaches john. ]
rose: good morning, mister... Locke?
John: yeah.
Rose: i'm rose nadler, the office supervisor. What can i do for you?
John: uh... What you can do, mrs. Nadler, is spare me the questions about what kind of animal i am and hopefully place me in a job.
[rose laughs. ]
rose: absolutely. What kind of placement are you looking for?
John: well, i see here that you have a listing for a site coordinator...
Rose: construction site coordinator. Uh... I'm not sure that's a good match.
John: well, if experience is the issue, i have--
rose: experience isn't the issue.
John: look... Mr. Reyes told me if i came down here i would be taken care of.
Rose: and mr. Reyes is my boss, so if he said that, i can make it happen for you. If you want to work construction, you got it.
John: thank you.
Rose: i'm not finished. I will send you down there tomorrow and then, the day after, you will be back in my office. Look, mr. Locke... Let's try to be a little more realistic.
John: and what do you know about realistic?
Rose: i have cancer. Terminal cancer.
John: i'm sorry...
Rose: when the doctors first told me, i had a hard time accepting it. But eventually... I got past the denial part. And i got back to living whatever life i've got left. So, how about we find you a job you can do?
[on-island - sawyer and locke walk through the jungle. ]
sawyer: do you read?
Locke: excuse me?
Sawyer: books. Do you read books?
Locke: sure. Who doesn't?
Sawyer: my favorite's steinbeck. Of mice and men. You know that one?
Locke: nope. A little after my time...
Sawyer: it's about these two guys, george and lennie. Lennie's kinda slow... Causin' george problems... So george walks him into the woods and tells him to look out yonder and picture the pretty little house they're gonna live in some day. Then he shoots lennie in the back of the head.
Locke: well that doesn't sound like a happy ending.
Sawyer: it ain't.
[sawyer points a gun at locke. ]
locke: what's on your mind, james?
Sawyer: i'm wonderin' what would happen to you if i put a bullet in your head.
Locke: why don't we find out?
Sawyer: what are you?
Locke: what i am is trapped. And i've been trapped for so long that i don't even remember what it feels like to be free. Maybe you can understand that. But before i was trapped, i was a man, james. Just like you.
Sawyer: i'm havin' a hard time believin' that...
Locke: you can believe whatever you want, that's the truth. I know what it's like to feel joy... To feel pain, anger, fear... To experience betrayal. I know what it's like to lose someone you love. So if you wanna shoot me, shoot me. But you're so close, james. It would be such a shame to turn back now.
[locke walks deeper into the jungle. Sawyer sighs and follows. ]
act 5
[across the island, frank and sun walk on ahead while ben and ilana carry locke's corpse in a make-shift stretcher. ]
ben: why did you have to bring him to the statue in the first place?
Ilana: because the people there need to see the face of what they're up against.
Ben: and whats to stop what they're up against from changing his face?
Ilana: he can't; not anymore. Hes stuck this way.
[they arrive at the graveyard in the old beach camp. ]
[moments later, ben and frank are digging a grave while ilana and sun prepare locke's corpse. They all lower locke into his final resting place. ]
ilana: does anyone want to say anything?
[no one responds initially. ]
ilana: didn't any of you know him?
Ben: alright, i knew him. John locke was a... A believer, he was a man of faith, he was... A much better man than i will ever be. And i'm very sorry i murdered him.
Lapidus: weirdest damn funeral i've ever been to.
[frank and ben then start to cover the body with dirt. ]
[flash sideways - john is already awake in bed when his alarm is ringing. He gets up and gets dressed. In his bathroom, after looking into a shaving mirror, he pushes it aside and looks at the contact card jack gave him at the airport. He dials the number on his cell phone. ]
women: hello, dr. Shephard's office?
[john takes the phone away from his ear, then puts it back. ]
woman: hello? Can i help you?
John: no, no you can't.
[as helen is making the bed in the other room, he hangs up. ]
helen: who was that on the phone?
John: no one.
Helen: no one? John, i just heard you talking on the phone.
John: i was uh, i was calling dr. Shephard.
Helen: good for you. When are you going to see him?
John: i'm not going to see him.
Helen: well, uh, i don't understand, why wouldn't you-
john: i got fired, helen.
[the doorbell rings. ]
helen: coming!
Man: [off-camera at first] ma'am, oceanic courier. Delivering your lost luggage. Sign here to accept the delivery.
Helen: thanks.
Man: okay, thanks.
[helen closes the door and brings the case inside to the kitchen. ]
helen: okay, john. Talk to me. How did you get fired?
John: i lied to randy, i didn't go to the conferences in sydney.
Helen: what?
John: open the case, helen.
[helen opens the case to find it is filled with knifes. ]
helen: what are these for?
John: my walkabout.
Helen: your, your what?
John: my walkabout. An adventure in the outback. Man against nature. But they wouldn't let me go. And i sat there yelling at them. Shouting at them that they couldn't tell me what i can't do. But they were right. I'm sick of imagining of what my life could be out of this chair, helen. What it would be like to walk down the isle with you because its not gonna happen. So if you need me to see more doctors, have more consults, if you need me to get out of this chair, i don't blame you. But i don't want you to spend your life waiting for a miracle because there is no such thing.
[helen approaches john and crouches down beside him. ]
helen: there are miracles, john. And the only thing i was ever waiting for was you.
[she rips up jack's card, then kisses john. ]
[on-island - sawyer and locke come to a bamboo ladder on the edge of a cliff. ]
sawyer: nice view. Now what?
Locke: now we go down.
Sawyer: down where?
Locke: down there.
[there is a shot of a very tall cliffside. ]
sawyer: no offense, but you already died. So this is great that this isn't a big deal for you. But if you think i'm climbing down there first, your off your damn mind.
Locke: it's no problem, i'll go first.
[locke walks to the ladder and starts to descend it. Sawyer approaches it and looks down at locke. ]
locke: coming, james? !
[sawyer starts to climb down it as locke moves across to rope ladder. When sawyer is nearing the bottom of his ladder, one of the rungs snaps and leaves him clinging on for his life. He recovers and moves over to the rope ladder. Locke is now on another rope ladder further down. Sawyer breathes a sigh of relief as he looks down. Then, the rope ladder comes detached from the wall, sending him flying down the cliffside and bouncing as the ladder snaps tight. He still hangs onto the ladder. ]
locke: james!
[locke starts to climb to help him. ]
sawyer: locke!
Locke: hold on, come on. Come on, i got you, come on. Come on. Come on.
[sawyer manages to swing across to the bamboo ladder that locke is now on with his help. They both descend and reach the bottom of the cliff. Then they come across a cave entrance with a set of scales on a wooden table. One black rock and one white rock balance the scales evenly. ]
sawyer: what is this place?
[locke takes the white rock from the scale and tosses it into the sea. ]
sawyer: what the hell's that all about?
Locke: inside joke.
Sawyer: so this is what you wanted me to see? A hole in the cliff; with some rocks on a scale; that's why i'm here?
[locke lights a torch. ]
locke: no.
[locke leads sawyer inside the cave. ]
locke: that's why you're here.
[sawyer takes the torch from locke and examines the walls of the cave to find they are covered with hundreds of names, most of which are crossed out. ]
locke: that, james, is why you're all here.
Act 6
[flash sideways - inside a school gym, dozens of students run back and forth across the court. ]
john: alright, speed it up, all the way. No cheating, come on now. Come on, all the way, you can catch up. Bring it in, bring it in, all the way. Good job. Good job.
[later, inside a class of students, john sits at the front desk. He opens a text book. ]
john: alright, everyone, please open your textbooks to chapter four. Today, we are going to talk about... The human reproductive system.
[outside in the hall, the bell rings and students flood from the classrooms. John stops one of them. ]
john: do you know where the- excuse me, can you tell me where the teacher's lounge is?
Kid: yeah, its over there.
[he points. ]
john: thank you.
[in the teacher's lounge, a man stands at the coffee machine with his back to the camera. ]
man: alright, i know i sound like a broken record, but how many times do we have to go over this? If you have the last cup of coffee, you remove the filter and throw it away. Fear not. I will make a fresh pot.
John: actually, i was just hoping for some earl grey.
[he turns around and we see it is benjamin linus. ]
ben: tea? Now there's a gentleman drink. I don't believe we met.
[they shake hands. ]
ben: ben linus, european history.
John: john locke, substitute.
Ben: well, welcome.
[john smiles. ]
[on-island - inside the cave. ]
sawyer: who wrote all this?
Locke: his name was jacob.
Sawyer: was jacob?
Locke: he died yesterday.
[we see locke kick jacob into the fire. ]
sawyer: you don't seem to upset about it?
Locke: i'm not.
Sawyer: why are all the names crossed out?
Locke: there not all crossed out.
[sawyer discovers "23-sherhard" written on the wall. ]
sawyer: "shephard". That jack shephard?
[we see jack accepting the apollo bar from jacob. ]
locke: he's not the only one.
["8-reyes" is on the wall. ]
sawyer: reyes. That's hugo, right?
[we see jacob and hurley in the taxi. ]
sawyer: what's the eight about?
Locke: jacob had a thing for numbers. Sixteen, jarrah.
["16-jarrah" is on the wall. We see jacob touch sayid on the shoulder. ]
locke: forty-two, kwon; i don't know if it's sun or if it's jin.
["42-kwon" is on the wall. We see jacob congratulate them at their wedding. ]
locke: here, four, locke. I think we both know him.
["4-locke" is on the wall. We see jacob touch locke on the shoulder. ]
locke: last but not least, number 15, ford.
["15-ford is on the wall. ]
locke: that would be you.
Sawyer: why would he write my name on this wall? I never even met the guy.
Locke: oh no, i'm sure you did meet jacob.
[we see jacob give young sawyer a pen. ]
locke: at some point in your life, james, probably when you were young and miserable and vulnerable. He came to you, he manipulated you, pulled your strings like you were a puppet. And as a result, choices you thought were made, were never really choices at all. He was pushing you, james. Pushing you... To the island.
Sawyer: why the hell would he do that?
Locke: because, you're a candidate.
Sawyer: candidate for what?
Locke: he thought he was the protector of this place. And you, james, have been nominated to take that job.
Sawyer: and what does that mean?
Locke: it means you have three choices. First, you can do nothing and see how all this plays out. And possibly, your name will get crossed out.
[he crosses "4-locke" out on the wall with chalk. ]
locke: second option. You can accept the job. Become the new jacob. And protect the island.
Sawyer: protect it from what?
Locke: from nothing, james. That's the joke, there is nothing to protect it from, its just a damn island. And it will be perfectly fine without jacob or you, or any of the other people; whose lives he wasted.
Sawyer: you said there were three choices?
Locke: the third choice, james, is that we just go. We just get the hell off this island. We never look back.
Sawyer: how do we do that?
Locke: together. So what do you say, james? Are you ready to go home?
[after a pause... ]
sawyer: hell yes.
Act 1
[shot of an eye opening; we see a woman (only her hand) select a cd and put it in a player. The camera reveals her as a new character. She looks in a mirror and tries to smile as the song (downtown by petula clark) starts to play. But she's obviously upset and almost starts to cry. She shakes it off and we hear an alarm beep. She runs to her smoking oven and pulls out a pan of burnt muffins, burning her hand in the process. Someone rings the doorbell and she opens the front door. We see an older woman who notices a towel wrapped around the other woman's hand. ]
juliet: i burnt my hand -- and my muffins.
[they hear a noise and both look over to see someone working on the house. We can only see his legs. ]
amelia: still hasn't fixed your plumbing yet?
Worker guy: [still not fully visible] it's a work in progress.
[scene switches back to inside the house, a little while later. We see a group of people sitting around the coffee table in the living room. ]
adam: it's not even literature. It's popcorn.
Amelia: and why isn't it literature, adam? I'm dying to know.
Adam: there's no metaphor. It's by-the-numbers religious hocum-pocum.
Amelia: no metaphor?
Adam: it's science-fiction -- now i know why ben isn't here.
Juliet: excuse me?
Adam: i know the host picks the book; but seriously, julie, he wouldn't read this in the damn bathroom.
Juliet: well, adam, i am the host and i do pick the book. And this is my favorite book. So i am absolutely thrilled that you can't stand it. Silly me for sinking so low as to select something that ben wouldn't like. Here i am thinking that free will still actually exists on--
[suddenly there is violent shaking like an earthquake. Everyone gets up. ]
juliet: the doorway -- get into the doorway.
[they all move to doorways and wait until the shaking stops. After it subsides we're outside and see everyone coming out of their homes. We see a brief shot of ethan, discovering that he was the man working on juliet's house. Then, we see the person we know as henry gale coming out of another house. Everyone looks up at the sky. They see a plane flying over which then breaks apart in mid-air and crashes. ]
gale: goodwin, did you see where the tail landed?
Goodwin: yeah, probably in the water.
Gale: you run and you can make that shore line in an hour. Ethan, get up there to that fuselage. There may actually be survivors; and you're one of them. A passenger -- in shock -- come up with an adequate story if they ask. Stay quiet if they don't. Listen, learn, don't get involved. I want lists in 3 days. Go.
[goodwin and ethan run off. Henry notices juliet standing nearby holding a stephen king book. ]
gale: so i guess i'm out of the book club.
[the camera moves so that we can see a wider and wider shot of the other's group of houses and how it's situated on the island. ]
act 2
[flashback - we see a shot of a pager, badge, and a crossword puzzle on a car seat. We hear moonlight serenade playing on the radio. The camera reveals jack sitting in his car. He's watching some kids in a playground at a school when he notices sarah approach a man who is carrying some art supplies. They talk and laugh as jack stares moodily. ]
[on-island - we see jack awaken to find himself lying on a metal platform. He peels off a band-aid and cotton ball that's covering a puncture wound in the crook of his arm. He unsuccessfully tries to open a door, and then tries to reach another area, but runs into a wall of reinforced glass which is one entire wall of his cell. ]
jack: [yelling] kate! Kate, can you hear me? ! Kate!
[scene switches to water from a shower hitting the ground. We see kate come to; and then tom (mr. Friendly) is revealed. They're in a sort of locker room. ]
tom: rise and shine, kate.
Kate: where am i?
Tom: you don't really think i'm going to answer that, do you?
Kate: where are sawyer and jack?
Tom: i'll tell you what, why don't you just take a nice hot shower -- wake yourself up -- wash the day off you and start fresh. There's a nice clean towel, soap, shampoo...
Kate: [defiantly] i'm not showering in front of you.
Tom: [laughing] kate, you're not my type.
[tom exits and we see kate remove a band-aid and cotton ball from her arm, as well. ]
[the scene switches to a shot of sawyer lying on the ground outside, coming to. He looks up and sees he is in a cage. We see a building nearby and a long walkway with a dharma logo stenciled on the awning. The camera pans to show another man in a cage across from sawyer's. ]
sawyer: hey. [the guy looks over, but doesn't respond] where are we? Who the hell are you? Oh, you ain't gonna talk to me? What -- you got more important things to do?
[sawyer looks around the cage and sees a large circular "button" protruding from the one solid wall of the cage. Inside it are a white fork and knife under a plexiglass-type cover. We also see a couple of large levers in different parts of the cage and a chute that's near the "button". Sawyer pushes the button and a voice from a speaker says: warning. Sawyer pushes the button again and the speaker again says: warning. Sawyer is about to push the button a third time when... ]
karl: i wouldn't do that.
Sawyer: if i want your advice -- i'll ask for it.
[sawyer pushes the button again and is shocked with electricity; he flies across the cage crashing in the bars. ]
sawyer: son-of-a-bitch! !
Karl: told you.
[back in jack's cell we see a red light flashing on a security-type camera. There is a long metal chain attached to ceiling of the cell and jack tries pulling on it hoping to find a way out. ]
unknown voice: stop that.
[jack looks and sees a woman. We see that it's juliet on the other side of the glass. ]
juliet: hi, jack. I'm juliet.
Act 3
[flashback - we see jack enter an office building and check-in with a receptionist. ]
jack: hi, i'm jack shephard. I'm here...
Sarah: [from a couch behind jack] where's your lawyer?
Jack: [sitting with her] you look pretty.
Sarah: where's your lawyer?
Jack: i fired him. Sarah, i'm sorry for, for pushing us to this place. I know that i...
[sarah's cell phone rings. ]
sarah: excuse me; i'm sorry. [she answers the call and walks a bit away] yeah, um, no not yet. He just got here. [she laughs] i'll call you when i get home. [she goes back to the couch] jack, i'm going to say this as simply as i can...
Jack: what's his name?
Sarah: jack, stop it.
Jack: i'm not going to stop it. I'm going to keep asking you that until you tell me.
Sarah: no, i don't ask you what you do in your...
Jack: just tell me what his name is! I want to know who he is. Look, you can have everything -- the cars, the house -- i don't care. I just -- i just want to know the name of the man that is with my wife.
[sarah stares at him but doesn't respond. Finally, she gets up and leaves. ]
[on-island - we see jack continuing to pull on the chain. ]
juliet: [turning up the volume on a sound board] jack, can you hear me in there? [he continues yanking the chain] is that a yes?
Jack: where are my friends?
Juliet: come down from the table first.
Jack: you want me to come down -- come in here and get me down.
Juliet: if you want to talk, i'm happy to...
Jack: tell me where my friends are! ! !
Juliet: i will -- if you let go of the chain.
Jack: you think i'm stupid? !
Juliet: i don't think you're stupid, jack. I think you're stubborn.
[jack continues pulling on the chain. ]
[scene switches to kate showering. She exits the stall in a towel and discovers her clothes are missing. ]
kate: [calling out] hey! Where are my clothes? !
[she notices a partially open locker door with a strip of masking tape across it that says: wear this. She pulls out a flowery sundress and puts it on. Suddenly tom appears. ]
tom: [whistles appreciatively at how nice kate looks] come on, kate. He's waiting.
[tom and three armed guards escort kate through a covered walkway and to a beach where henry is waiting under a thatch-roofed structure at a table laden with breakfast foods. Henry pulls out a chair for kate. Kate sees a pair of handcuffs lying on the table. ]
gale: sorry, i'm going to have to ask you to put those on, kate.
Kate: and if i don't?
Gale: then you don't get any coffee.
[kate puts the cuffs on. ]
gale: a little tighter. [kate gives a defiant look] please.
[kate makes the cuffs tighter. ]
kate: what did you do with sawyer and jack?
Gale: now why sawyer?
Kate: why sawyer what?
Gale: he's the first one you asked about. "what did you do with sawyer and jack? "
kate: you don't know me.
Gale: of course i don't.
Kate: i want my clothes back.
Gale: we burned them.
Kate: why did you bring me here? Why did you make me put on this dress? Why are you feeding me breakfast?
Gale: i brought you here so you'd look out at the water and feel comforted -- comforted that your friends were looking out at the same ocean. I gave you the dress so that you'd feel like a lady. And i wanted you to eat your food with a real live fork and feel civilized. I did all those things so that you'd have something nice to hold on to. Because, kate, the next two weeks are going to be very unpleasant.
Act 4
[flashback - we see jack sitting in his office, talking on the phone. ]
jack: yeah, hi. Uh, i met a woman on the train. Sarah. And she dropped her cell phone and i don't even know her last name. But your number was in her phone so i was just wondering... I'm sorry, forget it.
[christian enters the office. ]
christian: hey.
Jack: just give me a minute, dad. [christian walks toward jack's desk] i asked you to give me a minute here.
Christian: [indicating the list of phone numbers jack has] what's this? Why are you dialing all the numbers on sarah's cell phone?
Jack: [dialing another number] because one of them is him.
Christian: you've got to stop this, jack. It's over.
Jack: not until i know his name -- where he works, where he lives, when they first kissed. I want to know what it is about him.
[christian's cell phone rings. ]
jack: why is sarah calling you, dad?
Christian: i think it's time that you let this go.
Jack: why is she calling you? !
Christian: because she was afraid -- for you.
Jack: [yelling] i want to know exactly why the hell she was calling...
Christian: she could see that you were slipping -- you were losing your grip.
Jack: my grip is not the problem here!
Christian: which is exactly what's happening here! Jack, i think i know a little something about being obsessive.
Jack: no, being a drunk is not obsessive.
Christian: [exiting] let it go, jack.
[on-island - jack is letting some water from the ceiling drip into his mouth. He quickly spits it out. He hears a lot of static on a speaker. ]
jack: [to the speaker] what? If you're trying to talk to me, i can't hear you.
[jack hears the voice of his father come over the speaker: let it go, jack. A light suddenly comes on and we see juliet with a tray of food and water. ]
juliet: i know you're hungry. I brought this for you. This is how it will work. You sit there across from the door, back against the wall. I open the door and leave the tray. Can i trust you to do that, jack?
Jack: i don't want your food.
Juliet: well, it's a delicious sandwich...
Jack: i want you to tell the guy who's trying to talk to me through that intercom that he can give it up.
Juliet: maybe you're hungrier than you think. That intercom hasn't worked in years.
Jack: [pointing to button behind juliet] what's that for -- the button -- what's it for?
Juliet: it's for emergencies.
Jack: who's watching me?
Juliet: are you going to sit against the wall so i can open the door? [we get a shot of a grilled cheese sandwich] it's just off the frying pan.
Jack: you can have it.
Juliet: what do you do, jack? What's your profession?
Jack: i'm a repo man. You know, when people don't pay their bills i go in for the bank and i collect their possessions. I'm a people person so i really love it.
Juliet: are you married?
Jack: no. I never saw the point. What about you? What's your job, besides making sandwiches?
Juliet: oh, i didn't make it. I just put the toothpicks in. When your plane crashed, where were you flying from?
Jack: sydney.
Juliet: what were you doing there?
Jack: i was bringing my father home.
Juliet: why would you go all the way to australia just to...
Jack: because he was dead.
Juliet: i'm sorry.
Jack: [laughing] yeah, i'm sure you are. Thanks.
Juliet: you can trust me, jack. I'm not going to hurt you.
Jack: what the hell is going on here?
[juliet exits, taking a bite of the sandwich before she goes. ]
[we see sawyer trying to work out the lever-puzzle in the cage. ]
karl: hey. Hey, how long would it take to get to your camp?
Sawyer: what, you talking to me now, chachi?
Karl: from where they got you, how long a walk was it? A day, two days? And what are the people like from your plane?
Sawyer: oh, they're just awesome. [we see karl picking the lock to his cage while sawyer's busy on the puzzle] last one of you boys came for a visit got tortured by our iraqi. He tortured me, too. But hell, he don't know any better.
[sawyer turns and is surprised to see karl's cage door open. We hear a loudspeaker say: subject escaped; subject escaped. Karl suddenly comes into frame right in front of sawyer, and then starts picking the lock to sawyer's cage. ]
sawyer: hey, how'd you get out of there?
Karl: [opening the door and pointing] run that way.
Sawyer: hold on!
Karl: you run that way!
[sawyer starts running as karl runs in the other direction. Sawyer stops and tries to get his bearings. Suddenly juliet appears. ]
juliet: hey.
[she smiles, then pulls a taser-like device and shoots sawyer in the neck with a dart that immediately drops him. We see sawyer being dragged back to his cage by tom and another man. Once sawyer is back in his cage, tom drags karl to sawyer's cage and shoves his face up to the bars. ]
tom: say it. Say it, karl.
Karl: i'm sorry. Sorry, i involved you in my break out attempt.
Act 5
[we see jack sitting in his cell. Juliet enters the outer area with a tray of food and water. ]
juliet: the drugs we gave you when we brought you here have a pretty serious side-effect -- dehydration. Your head is probably sore, your throat is raw. If you don't eat or drink something soon you're going to start hallucinating.
Jack: so, you're a doctor, huh?
Juliet: no, i'm a repo woman. No strings attached. You don't have to answer any questions. You don't have to do anything but sit with your back up against the far wall. Let me open that door, put the plate down and leave. I know it feels like you're giving up, like you're losing, if you do anything that i ask you to. But you're not. You need to eat. What do you say?
[jack slowly moves to the far wall and sits. ]
juliet: thank you, jack.
[juliet exits her side of the room. ]
[flashback - we see jack at the hospital in a patient's room with a nurse. His father is in the hall in the background. ]
jack: [to the nurse] let's take out the epidural catheter and get him started on a pca.
[jack sees his father take a call from his cell. ]
nurse: you sure he's ready to self-administer his pain meds?
[jack is so intent on his father, who he sees talking and laughing on the phone, that he doesn't respond to the nurse. ]
nurse: dr. Shephard...
[we see christian pull up in front of a hotel. Jack is right behind and follows him into a room. He enters and finds christian getting some coffee in a small conference room. ]
christian: jack?
Jack: give me your cell phone.
Christian: what? What?
Jack: i want to see it. Now.
Christian: look where you are, jack. I mean, just look around you, please.
Jack: give me the phone.
Christian: this is not the place for this.
Moderator: you must be jack. Why don't you grab a chair and join us?
Jack: you know me?
Moderator: yes, your father's told us all about you.
Jack: yeah, what's he told you about me? What did you tell them about me, dad? That your son never really had it -- not like the old man. I didn't have the will to make it work? My life, my job, my marriage. What did you tell them about my marriage, dad? ! ! You want to know how he manages his marriage? A bottle of scotch every night before dinner.
Moderator: your father has been sober 50 days now. We're very proud of that.
Jack: [laughing] wow, dad, i wonder what helped you turn that corner? Do you think maybe it was a new lady friend? Do you think maybe that's what...
Christian: i will not let you you talk to me...
Jack: i will not let you sleep with my wife.
Christian: oh, jack. Jack, i'm your father. Jack, please just let it go.
[jack suddenly runs at christian and tackles him. ]
[on-island - we see jack in his cell. Juliet starts to enter and jack runs at her. He takes the taser/dart weapon, and puts a sharp piece of broken plate to her throat. ]
jack: which way out?
Juliet: don't do this, jack. Don't. Don't.
[he drags her to a hatch-like door with a wheel lock. ]
jack: open the door.
Juliet: no. I can't. I can't, jack. I do that -- we die. I'm not. I'm not.
Jack: open the door! !
Juliet: i can't! I swear i can't! !
Gale: [appearing] she's telling the truth, jack.
Jack: i swear to god, i will kill her.
Gale: okay. Have her open the door and she dies anyway. We all do.
[jack pushes juliet away and starts to open the door. Henry and juliet start running. Henry runs out a door and quickly closes it behind him, leaving juliet in the same area as jack. We hear a loud creaking sound and suddenly a huge gush water pushes the door in and throws jack backward. Juliet grabs onto a pipe and grabs jack. ]
juliet: jack, over here!
[together they push the door closed. ]
juliet: the button!
Jack: what?
Juliet: the yellow button, the button! !
[jack pushes the button and when he turns around juliet clocks him, knocking him out. ]
act 6
[we see sawyer stretching to reach a rock outside of the cage. He grabs the rock and places it on one of the levers. He throws his shoe at another lever. Sawyer has figured out the puzzle. A congratulatory song plays through the speaker and a voice says: reward, reward. We see a large fish-shaped cracker drop down the chute. ]
sawyer: [picking up the cracker] oh, come on. Unbelievable.
[a pile of food pellets then drop down the chute. Sawyer takes a bite of the cracker, and water starts coming out of a pipe. Sawyer drinks. ]
tom: [off camera] keep moving.
[we see kate being led to the cage karl used to occupy. ]
tom: stick your arms out through the bars; i'll take off your cuffs. They scratched you up pretty bad, didn't they? I'll bring you some anti-septic later.
Sawyer: how about you bring me an ottoman? While you're at it i could use a blow dry.
Tom: hey, you got yourself a fish biscuit. How'd you do that?
Sawyer: i figured out your complicated gizmos, that's how.
Tom: [exiting] only took the bears 2 hours.
Sawyer: [calling after tom] how many of them were there? [to kate] you okay, freckles?
Kate: [looking terrified, but trying to be tough] yeah. You?
Sawyer: just swell. I requested that cage, but whatever. Nice dress.
Kate: they made me wear it.
Sawyer: you hungry?
[sawyer tosses her the fish biscuit and she hungrily takes a bite. ]
[we see jack in his cell and hear some whale-like sounds. Juliet is sitting at a desk looking at some papers in a file. ]
jack: it's an aquarium.
Juliet: excuse me?
Jack: this thing's for what -- sharks?
Juliet: dolphins, too.
Jack: we're underwater, aren't we?
Juliet: yes.
Jack: is this one of their stations -- the dharma initiative?
Juliet: they called it the hydra.
Jack: so you people are just whatever's leftover of them.
Juliet: well, that was a long time ago. It doesn't matter who we were. It only matters who we are. We know exactly who you are, jack shephard.
Jack: you don't know anything about me.
Juliet: we know that you're a spinal surgeon based out of st. Sebastian's hospital in los angeles. I know that you went to columbia and that you graduated med school a year faster than anyone else. I know that you were married only once and that you contested the divorce. I know your father died in sydney. I know this because i have a copy of his autopsy report.
Jack: how did you get...
Juliet: we got it.
Jack: [referring to the file juliet has] what is that?
Juliet: this, jack, is your life.
Jack: do you -- is it just about me or is it about my family, too -- my friends.
Juliet: it's pretty much about everything.
Jack: do you know about my -- about my ex-wife.
Juliet: sarah. Yes, jack, we know all about her. What would you like to find out?
[flashback - we see jack in a jail cell. ]
guard: [opening the door] shephard, someone posted your bail.
[jack walks around a corner in the jail, putting his wedding ring back on, and sees sarah waiting. ]
jack: how'd you, uh...
Sarah: your dad told me you were here. I called you a cab. So, um, goodbye. [she exits]
jack: [following her out] sarah!
Sarah: what? !
Jack: is that him? [referring to a man waiting by a car across the street]
sarah: what difference does it make?
Jack: it just does.
Sarah: it's not going to change anything.
Jack: look, i want to know! I need to know who he is.
Sarah: it doesn't matter who he is. It just matters who you're not. Jack, your father -- he called me to help you. He was so drunk i could hardly understand him. Look at the bright side. Now you have something to fix.
[on-island - we're still with jack and juliet. ]
juliet: jack. Jack. What would you like to find out?
Jack: is she -- is she happy?
Juliet: yes, jack, she's very happy. Now, i'd like to bring you some food and water. But this time i need to know that you'll behave. Can i trust you, jack? Put your back against the wall, please.
[jack moves to the far wall and sits down. Juliet exits without giving jack any food. We see henry waiting for her. ]
gale: good work, juliet.
Juliet: thank you, ben.
Act 1
[flash-forward - a pile of fruit is shown with an ocean backdrop. The pile appears to explode as a car drives through it, and we see that the backdrop is in fact merely a picture, the scene is a city. The car drives erratically as police cars pursue. In a house, a man turns on a television, which shows live coverage of the high-speed chase on the news. The man watches the action whilst pouring himself a drink. ]
newsreader: almost 30 minutes now since the start of this high-speed chase. We still have no information about who's driving this vehicle. Jeff, can you tell us where the chase started?
Jeff: we're getting reports that the pursuit began near the la brea area, then travelled to a warehouse in the district south of the ten freeway.
Newsreader: can you see how many people are in the car?
[the man watching the television is revealed to be jack. ]
jeff: it would appear to be just the one, the driver. We're not sure if that's the owner of the car. What you're seeing here are pictures of the ten freeway, south of downtown.
Newsreader: is that a camaro, jeff?
Jeff: yes, yes it looks like a vintage early 70's model.
Jack: damn it.
[the car is surrounded by police vehicles and veers off the road, crashing. The police cars stop nearby and officers surround the camaro with guns. ]
policeman: show us your hands!
[the man inside the car breathes heavily. ]
policeman: pull down the window, and show us your hands now!
[the man does so. ]
policewoman: now slowly open the door with your left hand.
[the man does so. ]
policeman: get out of the car!
[the man again does so. ]
policeman: turn around, slow!
[the man turns, and he is revealed to be hurley. ]
policeman 2: on the ground!
Policewoman: now!
[hurley stares at the police officers, and tries to run. He is pinned against a wall by the officers. ]
hurley: stop! Don't you know who i am? Stop, wait, don't you know who i am? I'm one of the oceanic six! I'm one of the oceanic six! ! !
Act 2
[hurley is shown in an interview room with a cctv video showing him in a convenience store. ]
detective: so five minutes before you led ten cruisers on a chase across the city, you're minding your own business in a convenience store, until, you see something and freak out. Mr reyes, why'd you run like that? Who'd you see in there? Listen buddy, i know you saw somebody in that store and it made you run away in a...
Hurley: i wasn't running away from anyone.
Detective: do you think i care that you're a celebrity? You crashed your camaro in the wrong neighbourhood.
Hurley: i'm not a celebrity.
Detective: [chuckles] is that why you kept shouting "hey i'm one of the oceanic six"? You wanna know a funny coincidence?
Hurley: sure.
Detective: i knew somebody on your plane.
Hurley: really?
Detective: her name was ana lucia cortez. She was my partner before i made detective. Dark hair. Gorgeous. Maybe you knew her? Maybe you met her on the plane? Before it took off?
Hurley: sorry, never met her.
Detective: why don't you watch the tape. Maybe it'll spark something. I'm gonna get a doughnut, you want one?
Hurley: no thanks.
Detective: when i come back, you're gonna tell me who you ran from.
[the detective leaves the room. Hurley sits passively, and observes the video of him in the store, where he jumps in fear and rushes out of the place in sheer panic. He looks at the mirror in the interview room, which he then sees as an underwater window. A hooded man swims to the window, and touches the glass, which immediately smashes. As water splashes his feet and pours in quickly, hurley runs for the door. ]
hurley: help! Help! Help! Help! Help me! Help!
[the detective re-enters the room. ]
detective: the hell is wrong with you?
[hurley sees that there is no water in the room, the window being just a mirror again]
detective: what are you doing reyes? Huh, you trying to get tossed into the nuthouse? 'cause if that's what you want, i can make that happen right now, my friend.
Hurley: you can? [hurley hugs him] oh thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
[on-island - hurley radios by the dharma van for jack. ]
hurley: jack? You there dude? Beach to jack, come in jack. Beach to jack
[jack grabs his walkie and answers. ]
jack: right here, hurley, what's up?
Hurley: hey. Did you guys make it to that radio tower thingy yet?
Jack: yeah, and i talked to the people on the boat, they're on their way to pick us up right now.
Hurley: seriously? It worked?
[jack sees ben watching solemnly. ]
jack: seriously, we're all on the way back to the beach right now, so you better pack your bags buddy [he winks at ben].
Hurley: hahaha! Dude that's great! Woohoo!
[hurley walks towards the others at the beach, while meanwhile jack finds kate. ]
jack: any luck?
Kate: nothing, no sign of him. (she looks at naomi lying on the ground) it's like he just disappeared. Why would locke kill her? He hadn't even met her.
Jack: because he's crazy.
Kate: so what if he comes back?
Jack: he comes back, i'm gonna kill him. [they look at each other for a moment] i'm gonna get everybody together, the sooner we get back to the beach, the better.
Kate: are we really going home?
Jack: yeah. We're really going home.
[jack leaves, passing claire and sun, who are changing aaron. Rose is also present. ]
sun: [laughs] i can't believe i'm actually going to have my baby in a hospital.
Claire: [pushes her arm] oh rub it in why don't you!
Sun: [laughs] oh, no...
Rose: you ladies need a hand?
Claire: no, we're just wrapping things up, thanks. You know, you must be very proud with bernard, i hear he's quite the hero.
Rose: but everyone up here knows that the real hero is your man, claire. If charlie didn't turn off that gizmo, we'd still be getting a busy signal on that fancy phone. So you'd better make sure you treat him real good when we get back.
Claire: rose!
[they all laugh. Meanwhile, ben is tied to a tree with rousseau stood next to him. They watch alex and karl chatting and laughing. ]
ben: i need you to do me a favor. I need you to take alex and get as far from here as possible.
Rousseau: what?
Ben: listen to me, we don't have time for this. Everyone who stays here is going to die. Now get alex and get away right now, i don't care where you go, just go, i will not have my daughter
[rousseau hits ben in the face. ]
rousseau: she is not your daughter.
[at the beach, juliet is digging graves while sawyer drinks beer. Hurley and bernard are looking at the ocean. ]
hurley: did i ever tell you i won the lottery? I had like a hundred and fifty million dollars. Worst thing that ever happened to me.
Bernard: oh yeah, who needs a hundred and fifty million dollars, right?
Hurley: now it'll all be gone. Cause they all think i'm dead. We get rescued and i go back. I'm gonna be free. (pauses) i wanna do a cannonball. I've been walking up and down this beach everyday and looking out at this water. And i wanna do a cannonball.
Bernard: hurley. You wanna do a cannonball? Cannonball.
[hurley does so, running and laughing. He jumps into the water smiling, rises to the surface, and sees the others helping desmond pull the canoe to the shore. Hurley heads over. ]
sayid: are you alright desmond?
Desmond: we need to get to jack. We can't let him get in touch with that boat.
Sawyer: easy, scottie, everything's cool, boat's on the way.
Desmond: what? On the way? No.
Hurley: hey where's charlie?
Desmond: no that woman, naomi, she lied. The people on the boat aren't who they say they are!
Juliet: what?
Sawyer: then who are they?
Hurley: desmond, where's charlie?
Desmond: i don't know, but we need to get in touch with jack, now! !
Juliet: it's alright, we can call him, we have a walkie. It's ok.
Desmond: where is it, get it.
Bernard: what do you mean the people aren't who they say they are?
Hurley: [shouts] where's charlie? !
[they all stop. ]
desmond: [pauses] i'm, i'm sorry brother. I...
[everyone realises charlie is dead. ]
[at the radio tower, a phone rings. ]
kate: that's our ride.
[jack answers the satellite phone. ]
jack: hello.
Minkowski: hey jack. This is george minkowski. We're trying to get a lock on your signal there, but we're getting some rf interference. We're gonna need to re-jigger some of the settings on your sat phone.
Jack: er sure, ok, just tell me what i gotta tell.
Minkowski: how about you put naomi on.
Jack: naomi went to get some firewood. Can you hold on for a second, let me see if i...
[kate turns, and realises naomi's body is no longer there. Ben sits a little further away staring at the two of them. Jack hangs up on minkowski. ]
jack: where is she?
Ben: [grins, and mutters very softly "i dunno". ]
act 3
[at the beach, the group are still reeling from desmond's news. ]
sawyer: look, we gotta call the doc.
Sayid: did you listen to desmond? Charlie wrote on his hand.
Sawyer: look, i'm sorry he's dead. But i don't even know what the hell "not penny's boat" means.
Sayid: calling jack accomplishes nothing.
Juliet: it would accomplish warning him.
Sayid: it also means warning the people on the freighter that we're suspicious of them. I've no doubt they're monitoring our communications, if we call jack...
Sawyer: you know what? I got the walkie, i'm making the call. Hey!
[hurley grabs the walkie from sawyer's hand and throws it into the sea. ]
hurley: we better get going.
Sawyer: [shouts] going where? !
[at the radio tower, jack hands out torches as rousseau approaches. ]
rousseau: i found blood. The girl's trail. Probably crawled away. Can't be more than 10 minutes ahead of us. We should go, now, and find her.
Jack: [motions to ben] we're taking him with us.
Rousseau: why would we do that?
Jack: because i don't trust him with anybody but me.
[jack goes to the rest of the group. ]
jack: alright, listen up. I need all of you to head back down to the beach. When these people show up, we wanna make sure that we're real easy for them to find. Ok?
Claire: you look worried, jack.
Jack: the only thing i'm worried about is missing our ride home.
[everyone prepares to leave, and kate runs up to jack. ]
kate: i found her trail. She's headed west across the island.
Jack: rousseau already found it, we're going after her right now.
Kate: but, are you sure it's hers?
Jack: unless someone else is bleeding.
Kate: but if she didn't want us to find her, then she could have created a dummy trail. I think we should follow both just in case.
Jack: kate, six hours from now we're gonna be sitting on that boat laughing about the fact that there was one final thing that we couldn't agree upon. Naomi is hurt, she ran into the jungle, she's not thinking about leaving fake trails.
Kate: you're right.
Jack: i'll track her down, why don't you get everybody back to the beach.
Kate: you got it.
[kate hugs jack, as ben watches. ]
kate: be careful, ok?
[kate leaves, and jack heads out with rousseau and ben. ]
[at the beach, the group head inland from the shore, ready to find the radio tower group]
sawyer: the hell's gotten into you, hugo? They'll all be back in the morning, if you just wait.
Hurley: you don't wait with warnings dude, you warn.
[the group then divide up guns. ]
sawyer: and here i was thinking i was gonna get a good night's sleep.
[flash-forward - hurley plays connect 4 at a mental institution with a fellow patient. ]
hurley: you almost got me that time. How about best out of seven?
Nurse: are you ready for your meds, hugo?
[hurley takes the meds and swallows them quickly. ]
nurse: oh by the way, you have a visitor.
[hurley looks round to see a man with a visitor's badge on at another table. Hurley heads over to him. ]
visitor: mr reyes. Hello. My name is matthew abaddon. I'm an attorney for oceanic airlines. Can we talk for a few minutes?
Hurley: ok.
Matthew: i'm here, mr reyes, because we heard about your recent... Episode. Your arrest. Your incarceration here. Frankly, we feel terrible about it. So, on behalf of oceanic, i'd like to extend you an invitation for a little upgrade.
Hurley: what kind of upgrade?
Matthew: to a facility where the paint isn't peeling off the walls. Where you'd have your own bathroom. You could see the ocean from there...
Hurley: i don't wanna see the ocean.
Matthew: no problem.
Hurley: actually, thanks, i'm... I'm fine right here.
Matthew: are you fine mr. Reyes?
Hurley: what do you mean?
Matthew: you're in a mental institution.
Hurley: who'd you say you were again? I'd like to see a business card.
[abaddon reaches into his pocket, and presents nothing. ]
matthew: i must have left them at home.
Hurley: then we're done, dude.
[hurley prepares to go. ]
matthew: are they still alive?
Hurley: [pauses] what?
Matthew: you heard me.
Hurley: nurse. Nurse! Get out of here! You better get out of here! Help me. Help me, he's after me. No no no. That guy's after me. Help me.
Nurses: it's ok, it's ok.
[the man has left the room, the door closing behind him, as hurley looks for him. ]
[on-island - in the jungle at night, hurley and the group trek inland. ]
sawyer: alright there, hugo?
Hurley: yeah, dude, i'm fine.
Sawyer: you wanna talk about it?
Hurley: talk about what?
Sawyer: charlie. I mean, you two were buddies, i just thought...
Hurley: we'll probably get to jack faster if we don't talk.
[hurley continues on past sawyer. ]
sawyer: i'm gonna head up and tell 'em to slow down.
Hurley: i can keep up.
Sawyer: alright "ese"... Just holler if you need me.
[sawyer then goes on ahead. Hurley slowly follows, losing sight of the other survivors. ]
hurley: guys. Guys! Guys! Guys! ! ! Guys!
[hurley ends up in front of the cabin and hears whispers. ]
hurley: uh oh.
Act 4
[meanwhile, jack is following naomi's trail with rousseau and ben. ]
rousseau: the blood trail ends here.
Jack: what do you mean?
Rousseau: it ends.
Jack: you're telling me she stopped bleeding here?
Rousseau: no. I'm telling you that she fooled us. Doubled back.
Ben: better call the boat. Tell 'em she's getting a real big bundle of firewood.
[jack motions to get the phone, but realises it isn't in his pocket. ]
jack: where is it?
Ben: ok, i probably should have told you that i saw her take the phone, but you beat me up, jack. I owed you one.
Jack: what are you talking about?
Ben: kate took it when she hugged you.
[jack realizes his mistake. ]
ben: she found the right trail too, but you wouldn't listen to her, so i guess she's taken matters into her own hands. But look on the bright side, at least somebody around here knows what the hell they're doing.
[jack and rousseau head off back in the direction they came from. Jack tugs on the rope tying ben's hands together, causing him some pain. ]
[meanwhile, kate is following the real trail. The satellite phone starts ringing. Kate pauses and then decides to answer. ]
kate: hello.
Minkowski: who's this?
Kate: uh, this is kate.
Minkowski: you with jack?
Kate: no, no, he's not here.
Minkowski: where's naomi?
Kate: we're looking for her.
Minkowski: what do you mean, you're looking for her?
[kate ends the call. Blood drips onto her arm. Kate looks up to see naomi dive down onto her with a knife. She holds it to kate's throat. ]
naomi: give me the phone. Give me the phone.
Kate: naomi, listen to me. You're hurt, let me help you.
Naomi: help me? I just spent the last three days trying to get you people rescued. And you throw this knife in my back.
Kate: no, no, it was not us.
Naomi: who?
Kate: his name is john locke.
Naomi: why?
Kate: he said that you weren't who you said you were.
[the phone rings. ]
kate: i swear to god, we would never hurt you, you know us. Please. We need your help, please help us.
Naomi: give me the phone.
[kate does so. Naomi falls down and answers. ]
naomi: george. It's naomi.
Minkowski: naomi, where have you been? What's going on over there?
[naomi looks at kate. ]
naomi: i had an accident. I'm hurt.
Minkowski: wha, an accident. What accident? What happened? Naomi? Hello? Hello?
[naomi continues to stare at kate. ]
naomi: i hit a tree branch, when i parachuted in. Took it through my gut.
Minkowski: why did they tell me you were getting firewood?
Naomi: i guess they were afraid to tell you what happened to me until i could talk to you myself.
Minkowski: we've lost our signal and we can't come get you. Can you change your tracking frequency?
Naomi: yeah. [she presses buttons on the phone] try it now.
Minkowski: clear as a bell. Hang on naomi, we'll get you back here asap, ok?
Naomi: i'm sorry, george. Just tell my sister that i love her.
[naomi collapses. Kate realizes she is dead. ]
[at the cabin, hurley approaches with caution. There is a light on inside. ]
hurley: hello?
[hurley looks through a window into the house, seeing a dog painting on the wall, and christian shephard in a rocking chair. Another man comes up close to the window, his eye visible. Hurley runs. ]
hurley: help! Help! Help! ! !
[hurley turns round, and suddenly the house is behind him. The door creaks open. Hurley closes his eyes. ]
hurley: there's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here. There's nothing here.
[hurley opens his eyes again and the house has vanished. He runs backwards and falls over. He screams as he opens his eyes again. John locke is standing over him. ]
locke: hello, hugo.
Act 5
[hurley and locke sit together. ]
locke: you got yourself good and lost out here, hugo. How did you get separated from the group?
Hurley: i just... Fell behind, i guess.
Locke: is that why you were shouting for help?
Hurley: i got scared.
Locke: what desmond said happened down in that station, "not penny's boat. " are you sure that's what charlie wrote on his hand?
Hurley: jack should never have called those people.
Locke: i couldn't agree more.
Hurley: it's gonna be hard, to talk them into thinking they're not coming here to rescue us.
Locke: well, we're just gonna have to try our best, hugo. Because if we can't talk 'em out of it, then charlie died for nothing.
[sawyer, juliet and the others are at the front section of the plane wreckage. Hurley arrives. ]
sawyer: where the hell have you been, hugo?
Hurley: sorry, i was just er... I got lost.
[locke arrives also. ]
sayid: what are you doing here?
Locke: i came here for the same reason you did, to warn jack about the people on that boat. I already gave it a shot, but, i figured i might have better luck with some support.
Sayid: you want my support? You can tell me why you destroyed that submarine.
[the group hear voices. They aim their guns. It is revealed to be the other survivors from the radio tower group. ]
sun:  !
[sun runs over and hugs jin. Claire looks for charlie. Rose sees bernard and hugs him. ]
bernard: still in one piece.
Rose: rambo.
[she touches a bruise on his forehead. ]
bernard: ow!
[they laugh and hug. Juliet hugs alex. Desmond moves to speak to claire. Hurley overtakes. ]
hurley: i'll tell her.
[he goes over to her, crying. ]
hurley: he's dead. Charlie's dead.
Claire: no.
[they hug and cry together. Everyone else watches. ]
[flash-forward - hurley is sat outside within the mental institution grounds. He draws an eskimo and an igloo. A patient approaches hurley]
patient: i'd watch out if i were you.
Hurley: what you talking about, dude?
Patient: there's a guy over there, staring at you.
Hurley: what guy?
[the patient points. ]
patient: that guy.
[hurley looks over and looks scared. Charlie is standing by a car. ]
charlie: hey man. Don't run. Hurley. Just, just, sit down. I wanna talk to you. Come on. Don't do what you did in the store. Ok? There's no need to freak out.
Hurley: no need to freak out? I'm trying to buy some jerky and a slushy, and suddenly you're standing over there by the ho hos. You're dead, what do you expect me to do?
Charlie: can we just sit down?
Hurley: i may be in a mental hospital, but i know you're dead, and i'm not having an imaginary conversation with you.
[charlie takes off his sunglasses and stares hugo in the eyes. ]
charlie: i am dead. But i'm also here.
Hurley: ok, prove it.
[charlie slaps hurley. ]
hurley: alright, ok.
[they sit down together. ]
hurley: did you know you were going to die when you swam out there?
[charlie nods. ]
hurley: [choked up] then why didn't you tell me?
Charlie: because you would have tried to stop me. And since i was gonna do it anyway i thought i would spare you all the drama. And now you have to do something. But you're hiding from it. That's the real reason you ran when you saw me in the store. You knew i was here to tell you.
Hurley: i'm not listening to this. No, 'cause you're not here.
[hurley covers his ears and squints his face. ]
charlie: i am here, you're being a baby.
Hurley: i'm gonna close my eyes and count to five, and when i open them, you'll be gone.
Charlie: i am here.
Hurley: one!
Charlie: don't do this.
Hurley: two!
Charlie: they need you.
Hurley: three!
Charlie: they need you, hugo.
Hurley: four!
Charlie: you know they need you.
Hurley: five!
[hurley opens his eyes, and charlie is gone. ]
[on-island - hurley is still hugging claire. ]
claire: what, what happened? I mean, how, how did he...
Hurley: he was trying to help us.
[everyone stands silently, as rousseau and ben arrive. Locke turns, and jack punches him in the face without giving any warning. The others watch. Locke tries to grab his gun, but jack gets it from his hands. He cocks the weapon. ]
juliet: jack.
Locke: you're not gonna shoot me, jack. Any more than i was gonna shoot
[jack pulls the trigger, but no bullet fires. ]
locke: it's not loaded.
Act 6
[jack attacks locke. Sawyer and sayid pull him away. ]
sawyer: come on.
Jack: let go of me! Do you know what he did?
Sayid: [shouts] yes, i know what he did!
[locke gets up. ]
locke: all i did, all i have ever done, has been in the best interest of all of us.
Jack: are you insane?
Locke: i know i... I have a lot of explaining to do. But, i never did anything to hurt any of you. I even risked my life to tell you there was a traitor in your midst. [he points to juliet]
jack: she helped us, john. All you ever did was blow up every chance we had of getting off of this island. You killed naomi.
Ben: well, technically, he didn't kill her, yet.
Kate: yes, he did.
[the others turn to see kate arrive. ]
kate: she just died. She didn't give you up, john. She covered for us, and she fixed this.
[kate hands the satellite phone to jack. ]
kate: they're on their way.
Locke: she didn't cover for anyone. She wants her people to come here. And trust me, when they do, we had better be far away from here. I'm going to the barracks. The others abandoned them. It's the only place on the island with any form of security right now, it'll have to do until i can think of something else. Until then, if you wanna live, you need to come with me.
Jack: no one's going anywhere with you, john. Because they're not crazy.
Hurley: he's not crazy. What about charlie? Charlie went down to that place so we could all be rescued. And whatever he did down there, it worked. But then something must have happened. He must have heard something before he... [pauses] i don't know why, but he changed his mind.
[flashback images show charlie drowning, and showing desmond the message on his hand. ]
hurley: because the last thing he did was to warn us that the people on that boat are not who they said they were. So i'm not listening to you. I'm listening to my friend. I'm listening to charlie.
[hurley goes and stands with locke. ]
locke: anyone else? There isn't much time.
[claire joins them, as do a number of others. ]
ben: jack, with your permission, i'd like to go with john.
Jack: he's all yours.
[ben and rousseau join locke, as do alex and karl. ]
bernard: [to rose] you said you'd never leave the island. If you wanna go with locke, i'll be right behind you.
Rose: i'm not going anywhere with that man.
[sawyer moves to join them. ]
kate: what are you doing?
Sawyer: same thing i've always done, kate. Surviving.
[it starts to rain. Everyone looks somber. ]
locke: you know where to find us when you change your mind.
[locke leads his group away; the camp has been split into two factions. ]
[flash-forward - hurley is throwing a basketball into a hoop. Jack enters the gym. ]
jack: do you ever miss?
[he smiles, as does hurley. ]
hurley: jack.
Jack: yeah, i was on my way back from a consult. Thought i'd drop by and pay you a visit. Horse?
Hurley: you're on. So, consult, huh? Does that mean you're back doing surgical stuff?
[jack starts playing basketball with hurley. ]
jack: yeah.
[hurley shoots and scores. Jack shoots and misses. ]
jack: h.
Hurley: reporters leaving you alone?
[hurley shoots and scores. ]
jack: yeah. Still have to sign some autographs when i go out for coffee.
Jack: thinking about growing a beard.
[he shoots and misses again. ]
hurley: you'd look weird with a beard, dude. That's h-o. So, what are you really doing here, jack?
Jack: i was just checking on ya, seeing if everything was ok.
Hurley: checking to see if i was nuts, if i was gonna tell.
Jack: are you?
Hurley: you're up.
Jack: nah, you win. I, uh, i gotta run. It was great seeing you hurley.
[jack starts to leave. ]
hurley: i'm sorry. I'm sorry i went with locke. I should have stayed with you.
Jack: it's water under the bridge, man.
Hurley: i don't think we did the right thing, jack. I think it wants us to come back.
Jack: hurley.
Hurley: and it's going to do everything it can
jack: [shouts] we're never going back!
[jack heads for the door. ]
hurley: never say never, dude.
[on-island - jack and kate observe the front-section plane wreckage. ]
kate: are you thinking of charlie?
Jack: feels like a hundred years ago that we came out here together. How did this happen?
[noises can be heard. ]
kate: thunder's getting louder.
Jack: that's not thunder.
[the sound is a helicopter. It shines its light on jack and kate, and they see someone parachute out. ]
jack: come on.
[they find the parachutist, who pulls off his helmet and stares at them. ]
parachutist: are you jack?
[jack and kate look with apprehension. ]
act 1
[a 1970s-era alarm clock sits at 8:14. The 4 flips to a five and the alarm buzzes. A hand reaches over and hits the snooze button, silencing the alarm. The hand belongs to a man, in bed with his wife. A baby cries in the distance. ]
wife: ah. Mm. Baby's awake.
[the crying continues. The man sighs. ]
wife: it's your turn.
[the baby continues crying. The man sighs again. The crying continues. She kisses him. The man stirs awake. He takes a record out of its sleeve and puts it on a 1970s-era record player. Willie nelson's "shotgun willie" plays. The man puts a bottle on the stove to warm, then picks up the baby from a crib. The baby coos. ]
record: shotgun willie sits around in his underwear / bitin' on a bullet pullin' out all of his hair
[the man cradles the baby in his arms and rocks in a rocking chair as the baby feeds from the bottle. ]
record: shotgun willie's got all of his family there
[the man showers, shaves, brushes his teeth, and pulls one of a dozen identical black turtlenecks out of a closet. ]
record: well, you can't make a record if you
[the record skips. ]
record: can't make a record if you can't make a record if you can't make a record if you can't make a record if you
[dressed, the man picks up the needle from the record, and it scratches. ]
[outside, the man shuffles toward a house in the dharma initiative barracks. There are the indistinct sounds of conversations as people busy themselves like villagers all around. Birds chirp and squawk. Now inside the building, a man in a dharma initiative jumpsuit greets the man. ]
director: morning. Here you go, doc.
[the hairy-chinned director tries to hand the man pages. ]
chang: i don't need a script. Let's go. I don't have all day.
[a sound man preps a boom mic, a cameraman readies a camera, and a wardrobe woman, with a choice of tan tweed jacket or a white dharma lab coat with a swan logo on it, hands dr. Chang the lab coat. This barracks building is, for today, a bustling makeshift film set. Chang puts on the coat and sits down in a leather chair. ]
sound man: speed.
Director: okay. Dharma orientation film number two, take one.
[the director claps the slate. The camera whirs. ]
director: and... Action.
Chang: hello. I'm dr. Marvin candle, and this is the orientation film for station two, the arrow. Given your specific area of expertise, you should find it no surprise that this station's primary purpose is to develop defensive strategies and gather intelligence on the island's hostile indigenous population
[the door bangs open. A man in a hardhat bursts through. ]
man: dr. Chang! Dr. Chang?
Chang: damn it! What the hell? !
Director: cut!
Man: sir, we got a problem down at the orchid.
[a blue dharma microbus pulls up to the orchid, still under construction. A construction worker carries a sawhorse past as dr. Chang and the hard-hatted man get out of the microbus and enter the orchid. ]
[the two descend in the elevator. When they reach the bottom, the hard-hatted man lifts the elevator gate, and dr. Chang's attention is caught by the construction foreman, who leads dr. Chang down a passage hewn out of the rock. All around, workers are busy, hauling rock and welding tunnel supports. ]
foreman: over here. We were cutting through the rock, right on your specs. That's when the drill melted.
Chang: the drill melted?
Foreman: yeah, yeah. 3 meters in. We went through six carbon drill bits, and the last one just fried.
[a hard-hatted construction worker lies motionless on the rocky ground with a bloody nose. Other workers move to attend to him. ]
foreman: then my operator starts grabbing his head and freaking out. We sonar-imaged the wall. There's an open chamber about 20 meters in, behind the rock.
[the foreman hands dr. Chang a print-out in which the image of the frozen wheel is visible. ]
foreman: there's something in there. And the only way to get to it is to lay charges here and here and blast through it and take a look
chang: under no circumstances! This station is being built here because of its proximity to what we believe to be an almost limitless energy. And that energy, once we can harness it correctly, it's going to allow us to manipulate time.
Foreman: [chuckles] right. Okay, so, what? We're gonna go back and kill hitler?
Chang: don't be absurd. There are rules, rules that can't be broken.
Foreman: so what do you want me to do?
Chang: you're gonna do nothing. If you drill even 1 centimeter further, you risk releasing that energy. If that were to happen...
[chang looks at the fallen workman and the blood all over his face. ]
chang: ... God help us all.
[chang hands his hardhat to the foreman and takes off back down the tunnel toward the elevator. ]
worker: [offscreen] all right, get him up.
Foreman: come on. Let's go.
[as chang charges down the tunnel, he brushes shoulders with a hard-hatted construction worker traveling the opposite direction. The worker carries a pressurized tank of gas. ]
chang: watch yourself!
Tank carrying worker: sorry, sir. It won't happen again.
Worker: [offscreen] we need a doctor.
Foreman: come on. I'll grab the rest of his stuff. Let's go.
[two workers lift the fallen man away on a stretcher. The tank-carrying worker sets down his tank, and we see it is daniel faraday. ]
foreman: did you hear that? Time travel. How stupid does that guy think we are?
[faraday nods, and looks at the rock wall as the foreman moves off. ]
foreman: let's go, guys.
[off-island - at hoffs/drawlar funeral parlor, the body of john locke lays inside an open casket. A bearded, stoned jack shephard looks over him and sighs deeply. Benjamin linus enters with a wheeled table and unfolds it. ]
ben: why don't you close that up now, jack? Come on. Let's get him in the van. It's out back.
Jack: where are we taking him?
Ben: we'll worry about that once we pick up hugo.
Jack: [sighs] hurley... Is locked away in a mental institution.
Ben: which should make recruiting him considerably easier than the rest of your friends.
Jack: they're not my friends anymore.
Ben: oh, that's the spirit.
Jack: how did we get here? How did all this happen?
Ben: it happened because you left, jack. Now let's get started, shall we?
[ben slams the casket shut. ]
[in a hotel room, jack stands over a sink, having just finished shaving off his beard. A male newscaster speaks indistinctly on the television. Ben is packing his clothes. Jack splashes water on his face and dries it with a towel. ]
jack: so once we get hurley... Then what?
Ben: then we get sun, sayid... And kate, of course.
Jack: i don't see that happening.
[the newscaster continues speaking indistinctly. Jack sits down on one of the hotel beds. ]
jack: when was the last time you saw him? I mean, locke.
Ben: [sighs] on the island... In the orchid station, below the greenhouse. I told him i was sorry for making his life so miserable, and then he left. So obviously john's visit to you made an impression. What did he say to make you such a believer?
Jack: sawyer, juliet, everyone from the boat... And everyone we left behindjohn said that they'd die, too, if i didn't come back.
Ben: did he tell you what happened to them after the island moved?
Jack: no. No, he didn't.
Ben: then i guess we'll never know.
[title card: three years earlier]
[on-island - dressed in the orchid parka in the frozen wheel chamber, benjamin linus grunts to move the frozen wheel. The metal grinds and creaks and centuries-old ice is dislodged. A buzzing and magnetic humming sounds starts to envelop the chamber, and the whole island. Outside in the jungle, at the others' camp, richard and locke look up. The buzzing and humming continue. On the beach, sawyer and juliet look up at the sky, and stand to face the source of the noise. On the open ocean, daniel faraday and his zodiac raft full of flight 815 survivors look toward the island. Aboard the helicopter, flying above the open water, aaron cries in kate's arms, as desmond, lapidus, and the oceanic six look around and at each other. Back in the wheel chamber, the buzzing and humming grow louder. Ben continues to struggle with the wheel until he has turned it full and white light bathes the wheel chamber. The humming becomes a crackling, pulsating sound. Juliet and sawyer shield their eyes. The light envelops the whole island. The zodiac passengers are struck by the light. Richard turns away and locke puts a hand up to shield his eyes. The sound has become a loud rumble. The white light consumes everything, and then is gone, and the rumbling stops. Locke stands with his arm to his face, but it is raining. Thunder crashes. ]
locke: what the... Richard? Richard? ! Anyone? Anyone? !
[locke stands alone. Where the others' camp was, there is nothing. ]
[aboard the zodiac raft, the passengers look around to get their bearings. One of them yells above the sound of the motor whirring and revving. ]
frogurt: what happened? What was that light?
Faraday: we must've been inside the radius.
[back on the beach. ]
sawyer: what the hell was that?
Juliet: i don't know.
[sawyer scans the horizon. ]
sawyer: where's the freighter?
Juliet: maybe it went down.
Sawyer: unh-unh. No way. A minute ago, that boat was coughing black smoke. Now there's just nothin'?
Juliet: what about the helicopter?
Sawyer: it was heading for that boat.
[bernard stumbles out of the jungle. ]
bernard: rose! Rose!
Juliet: bernard!
Bernard: rose! Have you seen rose? !
Juliet: no.
[rose stumbles out of the jungle. ]
rose: oh, my god! Bernard!
Bernard: rose! Where were you?
[the two embrace. ]
rose: i was over... [panting] by the church. Wh-what was that sound? What was that light?
Bernard: i don't know.
Sawyer: just calm down. There's no need to panic, all right? We'll just go back to camp and
bernard: "calm down"? "no need to panic"? We can't go back to the camp.
Sawyer: what the hell are you talking about?
Bernard: there is no camp.
[bernard leads sawyer, juliet, and rose back to the camp where the rest of the 815 survivors mill about. Where there used to be shelters, now there is only jungle. ]
bernard: thethe sky lit up, aand then this. Thethe kitchen? Gone. Andand all the tents, all the food and water... Gone. Well, everything but us. All of it. It's gone.
Faraday: it's not gone.
[faraday and the other zodiac passengers approach. ]
charlotte: daniel!
Faraday: hey.
[they hug. ]
charlotte: i thought you were on the freighter.
Faraday: no, we never made it. We were on our way out there when it happened.
Sawyer: what do you mean, the camp's not gone? Who the hell are you anyway?
Miles: that's dan. He's our physicist.
Faraday: listen, we have no time. I need you to take me to something man-made, something that was built, any kind of a landmark.
Juliet: there's a dharma station 15 minutes from here.
Sawyer: you mean the hatch? The one we blew up?
Faraday: that's perfect. We should get moving before it happens again, okay?
Sawyer: before what happens again? And why is our camp gone?
Faraday: your camp isn't gone. It hasn't been built yet.
Act 2
[off-island - kate's house in los angeles. A cartoon plays on a tv set. In the cartoon, a car climbs a cliff road. Brakes squeal, and a train rattles. Aaron, a little older than three, sits at a table and watches intently, his breakfast uneaten in front of him. Kate pours some coffee. A train horn blows in the cartoon. ]
aaron: choo choo! Tunnel!
Kate: oh, i think choo choo knows better than that. He goes into that tunnel, he's never coming back out.
[kate delivers aaron a beverage and touches him cutely on the nose. The doorbell rings. ]
kate: watch your cartoons, goober. Mommy'll be right back.
[she kisses aaron on the head and opens the door. Two men dressed in navy blue suits stand on the other side. ]
norton: ms. Austen?
Kate: yes?
Norton: hi, i'm dan norton of the law firm agostini & norton. May we have a moment of your time?
[norton holds up a business card. Kate does not take it. ]
kate: [gesturing to the other man] and who are you?
Norton: he's my associate. If i could just come in, i'll be glad to explain
[norton tries to enter, but kate steps up to him and bars his entrance. ]
kate: no, you can explain right here.
Norton: okay, you got it. Ms. Austen, we're here to get a blood sample from you and one from your son aaron.
Kate: excuse me?
[norton takes a folded paper out of his pocket. ]
norton: now, i have a court order signed by a judge for you to relinquish your blood upon being served these papers
kate: why?
Norton: to determine your relationship to the child.
Kate: i'm sorry. I don't understand. Um, who's the
norton: i'm not at liberty to divulge the identity of my client.
Kate: your client?
Norton: please, may we come in?
[norton tries to enter again, and kate steps up to him again. ]
kate: get off my property.
Norton: if you won't comply, then i'm going to have to come back with the sheriff.
Kate: then come back with the sheriff.
[kate slams the door in norton's face, then turns around, her back to the door. Aaron has turned around in his chair to watch, ignoring his cartoons. ]
[in the bedroom, kate takes out a suitcase and hurriedly packs some clothes and shoes. From above a cabinet, she pulls a large stack of cash wrapped in paper, and from within a shoebox, a semi-automatic pistol. ]
aaron: where you going, mommy?
[aaron is standing in the bedroom, watching. ]
kate: we're going on vacation, baby.
[kate lifts the suitcase and takes the child by the hand. At the bottom of the staircase, kate descends, aaron in one arm and the suitcase in the other. She heads to the front door, grabs her keys from the desk, opens the door... ]
kate: say bye-bye, baby.
[... And, pulling the suitcase through, slams the door behind her. ]
[on-island - back in the jungle. Sawyer walks shirtless and shoeless at the front of the group, with juliet behind him, and faraday behind her. ]
juliet: why did you jump off that helicopter?
Sawyer: i told you. We were runnin' out of gas. I wanted to make sure she(sighs) i wanted to make sure they got back to the boat. Don't matter now anyway, does it?
[faraday pushes past to the front of the line. ]
faraday: excuse me. I really need the two of you to pick up the pace. Okay? Thanks.
Sawyer: first things first. Gimme your shirt.
Faraday: my shirt?
Sawyer: yeah.
Faraday: i really think we have far more pressing matters than me giving you a shirt. How about we just keep moving, okay?
Sawyer: how about we call a time-out so you can tell us what the hell is going on?
Faraday: how about you trust me?
Sawyer: trust you? I don't know you!
Faraday: we really do not have time for me to try to explain. You have no idea how difficult that would be for me to try to explain thisthis phenomenon to a quantum physicist. That would be difficult, so for me to try to explain whatever is happening
[sawyer slaps faraday. ]
charlotte: oi! What in bloody hell do you think you're doing?
[she moves forward to defend faraday. ]
sawyer: shut it, ginger, or you're gettin' one, too.
[faraday sighs. ]
sawyer: now talk.
Faraday: the island... [sighs] think of the island like a record spinning on a turntable... Only now, that record is skipping. Whatever ben linus did down at the orchid station... I think... It may have... Dislodged us.
Miles: dislodged us from what?
Faraday: time.
Juliet: so that's why our camp is gone? Because the island is moving through time?
Faraday: yeah, either the island is, or we are.
Sawyer: what?
Faraday: and it's just as likely that we're moving, your people and us. And everyone in your groupyou're all accounted for, right?
Sawyer: [sighs deeply] not everyone. ... Locke.
[locke traverses jungle terrain, passing over a stream. Birds chirp. He climbs a hill. ]
[now on a grassy prairie hill, locke hears a motor drone in the distance. He charges up the mountainside and looks up in the sky. The droning grows louder as the beechcraft, one engine disabled, plummets right toward him. Locke ducks just in time and the plane passes overhead and then down below him into the valley. Locke hears a crash and sees black smoke rise. Then, there is only the sound of a cricket chirping. Locke runs back down the way he came, and comes upon a small religious statuette. He picks it up and examines it. ]
[back down in the valley, still carrying the statuette with him, locke finds the beechcraft stuck up in the trees, one propeller creaking as it spins slightly. ]
locke: is anyone there? !
[the creaking continues. ]
locke: hello? !
[the creaking continues. ]
locke: hello? !
[the creaking continues. Locke grunts and pants as he runs toward the vines that boone had earlier ascended to climb up into the fuselage of the beechcraft. The plane still creaks in its precarious perch in the jungle canopy. Thena gunshot, and the bullet ricochets, just to locke's right. Locke pants as he looks down. He is very high up already. Another gunshot explodes, again just to his right. ]
locke: hey!
[a third gunshot gets locke in the right leg, and he loses his grip and falls backward toward the ground, landing in some foliage. ]
locke: uhh!
[locke pants and grunts as he feels his wound, which is now bleeding profusely. Leaves rustle and footsteps approach. Locke tries to sit up, just in time to see a man with a rifle emerge from behind a frond. The man points the gun directly at locke. ]
ethan: who are you?
Act 3
locke: well, listen, listen
ethan: how many others onboard?
Locke: you don't understand. I didn't come on that plane.
Ethan: wrong answer.
[he raises the gun to aim. ]
locke: no, wait! Stop! Stop! I know you. I know who you are. Your name... Your name is ethan. Your name is ethan.
Ethan: who are you?
Locke: my name is john locke. I know this is gonna be hard to understand, but ben linus appointed me as your leader.
Ethan: that is the most ridiculous thing i've ever heard.
[the island starts to hum, and rumbling can be heard in the distance. ]
ethan: good-bye, john locke.
[ethan raises the gun again and prepares to fire, as he is engulfed in white light. Locke braces himself, but when the humming stops and the light vanishes, he is left alone, and it is now darknighttime. ]
[meanwhile, elsewhere on the island... ]
sawyer: great.
[the group looks around. ]
sawyer: so when are we now, whiz kid?
Faraday: we're either in the past... Or we're in the future.
[off-island - sun descends an escalator in an airport, listening to her cell phone. It rings and she waits for someone on the other end to pick up. A woman with a british accent makes an announcement over the pa. ]
woman: flight 23 to paris will begin boarding at gate 15. Please have your boarding passes ready.
[as the pa announcement is repeated in french, sun gives up, closes her cell phone, and approaches the ticket counter, where a female ticketing agent waits. ]
ticketing agent: [british accent] evening, ma'am. Where you flying to tonight?
Sun: los angeles.
Ticketing agent: of course. May i see your passport, please?
Sun: mm-hmm.
[the ticketing agent scans sun's passport and the scanner beeps as she does so. The passport image comes up on the agent's screen and a look of quiet alarm comes over her face. ]
ticketing agent: excuse me. Could you wait here for just one moment, ms. Kwon?
[a tall security guard ushers sun, her carry-on in tow, into a holding room, then shuts the door behind her and guards the door from the other side. ]
sun: hey! Where are you going?
[she tries the door handle, then bangs. ]
sun: open this door. Open this door!
Widmore: save your breath.
[charles widmore emerges from a door on the other side of the room and closes it behind him. ]
widmore: they only do what i tell them to do.
Sun: you. You had me brought in here? Why?
Widmore: you had the audacity to approach me in broad daylight in front of my business associates... In public. Why did i have you brought here? Because you showed me no respect. I will be respected, sun.
Sun: fair enough.
[she steps forward and sits down at a table. He sits too. ]
widmore: since you seem to be worried about your plane, i'll get right down to business. You mentioned that you and i had... Common interests. Why don't you tell me exactly what they might be?
Sun: to kill benjamin linus.
[benjamin linus watches tv in the hotel room. Jack is now fully dressed in a suit. ]
female news anchor: [on tv] the victim was found shot in his car on the grounds of the santa rosa hospital, a private mental health care facility outside los angeles.
Jack: okay. Let's go get him.
Female news anchor: police have now identified their suspect in the shooting as a patient at the hospital who escaped earlier this eveninghugo reyes.
[at the sound of the name, jack pays attention to the tv, which shows footage of hurley from the oceanic six press conference. ]
female news anchor: now if that name sounds familiar to you, that's because reyes was a member of the infamous oceanic six. As to why he may have murdered a visitor to the facility where reyes lived for two years, that remains a complete mystery.
Ben: [turning off the tv with a click of the remote] well... Looks like we have a change of plan.
[ben turns to leave. ]
[exterior, the rainbow drive-in. Night. Hurley and sayid wait in a car, staking out the place. ]
hurley: [intensely] here she comes, right now.
Waitress: here's your order, sir.
[the woman walks up and delivers a bag full of fast food to the car. ]
sayid: keep the change.
Waitress: thank you.
[sayid starts engine. ]
hurley: [looking into the bag, inspecting its contents] awesome.
[sayid shifts the car into gear. ]
hurley: you want a fry?
Sayid: no, thank you.
Hurley: you know, maybe if you ate more comfort food you wouldn't have to go around shooting people.
[sayid pulls the car away. ]
[the suv pulls into the parking lot of an apartment complex. The two get out, and walk along the exterior balcony to the apartment door. ]
hurley: so that dude you popped outside santa rosawho was he?
Sayid: i don't care. He was armed and he was watching you. That made him an enemy.
Hurley: do you think he was gonna kill me?
Sayid: i'm not taking any risks. After bentham died
hurley: you mean locke.
Sayid: yes, i mean locke.
Hurley: i need a cool code name.
[they climb a flight of stairs and turn the corner. A dog barking in distance. ]
hurley: so when'd you become so paranoid?
Sayid: if you'd spent the last two years doing the things i was doing, you'd be paranoid, too.
Hurley: oh, yeah? Paranoid like what? What kind of things?
Sayid: i was working for benjamin linus.
Hurley: wait. He's on our side now?
Sayid: listen to me, hurley. If you ever have the misfortune of running into him, whatever he tells you, just do the opposite.
[horns honking in distance. Sayid looks up to see a piece of scotch tape on the door has been severed. ]
sayid: wait here.
[sayid pushes hurley aside, flings the door open, draws his gun, and points it inside. But a man ambushes him and knocks the gun out of sayid's hands. Sayid blocks the man's punch, grabs him, and flings him over the balcony, where the man falls three stories to the parking lot, screaming on the way down. Hurley looks down at the dead attacker, mortified. Two silenced gunshots whiz by sayid's head as a second assailant charges sayid. Sayid grab's the man's arm and pushes him inside the apartment, knocking over a tv and breaking glass, causing the man to drop his gun. Sayid is thrown and lands on a couch. The man recovers his weapon and takes aim at him, but sayid throws a lamp at him, which he ducks. Sayid jumps the countertopped by a pizza boxand makes a run for a kitchen cabinet, reaching for a hidden pistol taped underneath it, but too late. The man fires at sayid. Three more silenced gunshots. Darts land in his shoulder and neck. Sayid pulls the dart from his neck and drops it in the kitchen sink, then slumps over the sink. The man approaches cautiously. Sayid springs up, grabbing a griddle pan from the dish-drying rack and hitting the attacker in the head with it, then sayid tries to pry the gun from the man's grip. The gun hits the floor, and in the struggle the dishwasher comes open, its bottom shelf rolling out with several sharp kitchen knives sticking up from its silverware basket. The attacker pushes sayid into the refrigerator and comes after him, but sayid blocks his attack, hits him in the face, grabs his wrist with one hand and chokes his throat with the other, and kicks the man's foot out from under him. The man falls backward, landing right onto the basket of knives. ]
[outside the apartment, hurley picks up the gun dropped by sayid onto the balcony floor. Below him, several men have begun to gather around the body of the first attacker. ]
first man: is he all right?
Second man: i don't know.
First man: is he breathing or what?
Third man: who is that? Check him out.
[they all look up at hurley, who peers over the balcony, still holding sayid's piece in his hand, to watch the commotion below. ]
first man: look out! That guy's got a gun!
[one of the men points his cell phone up toward hurley and it flashes a picture of hurley holding a gun up on the balcony above. ]
second man: run!
First man: get out of here! Call the cops! Hurry!
[inside the apartment, sayid grunts, groggy and struggling to move. Hurley enters. ]
hurley: sayid! Whoa. You okay?
Sayid: get me to the car.
[hurley helps sayid out of the apartment. ]
hurley: dude. Dude. Oh, man. I thought it was supposed to be a safe house. I never should've left the island.
Act 4
[on-island - in the jungle, it is night, and the survivors traipse on. ]
charlotte: hey, do you think he's looking for us?
Miles: who?
Charlotte: widmore.
Miles: it took him, like, 20 years to find this place the first time. I'll start holding my breath now.
Juliet: over here!
[they all look down at a great pit in the earth. ]
faraday: is this the hatch?
Sawyer: it was. Blown up, just like we left it.
Faraday: okay. So when we are now... It's now after you and your people crashed on the island.
Sawyer: you sayin' our camp is back on the beach again?
Faraday: it's possible, yeah.
Sawyer: good. I'm going back.
Faraday: hey. No, no. It's pointless.
Sawyer: more pointless than staring at a hole in the ground?
Faraday: we don't know when the next flash is coming. By the time you get back to the beach, the camp could be gone again.
Sawyer: yeah, but what if it ain't? Hell, what if the helicopter hasn't even taken off yet?
Juliet: we could warn them, stop them from ever flying to that boat.
Faraday: that's not the way it works.
Sawyer: who says?
Faraday: you cannot change anything. You can't. Even if you tried to, it wouldn't work.
Sawyer: why not?
Faraday: timeit's like a street, all right? We can move forward on that street, we can move in reverse, but we cannot ever create a new street. If we try to do anything different, we will fail every time. Whatever happened, happened.
Sawyer: how do you know so much about this, danny boy?
[faraday removes his backpack and removes his journal from it. ]
faraday: [sighs] i know about this because... I've spent my entire adult life studying space-time. I know all this because this journal contains everything i've ever learned about the dharma initiative. This is why i'm here. I know what's happening.
Sawyer: so how can we stop it?
Faraday: we can't stop it.
Sawyer: then who can?
[in the dark jungle, locke attempts to get up. ]
locke: [grunting] aah!
[locke groans, pants, grunts, and hobbles his way into the shelter of the beechcraft fuselage, now on the ground and burnt-out. He takes a strap and tightens it around his leg as a tourniquet. ]
locke: aah! [grunts]
[footsteps approach. Locke unsheathes his knife. The footsteps grow nearer. Locke points his knife. Richard alpert emerges from the darkness carrying a torch. ]
locke: richard?
[locke puts down his knife. ]
richard: hey, john.
Locke: richard... What is happening?
Richard: what's happening is that you're bleeding to death. Here.
[locke grunts and groans. ]
richard: i need to get the bullet out.
Locke: how did you know there was a bullet in my leg, richard?
Richard: because you told me there was, john.
[richard unzips his backpack and takes out a first aid kit. ]
locke: no, no. No, i didn't.
Richard: well... You will.
[panting. ]
locke: it was ethan who shot me.
Richard: well... [donning eyeglasses] what comes around, goes around.
[richard pours some alcohol onto locke's wound. ]
locke: aah! When am i?
Richard: well, john, thatthat's all relative.
[richard puts some tweezers toward locke's wound. ]
locke: wait, wait. When the sky lit up... Where did you go?
Richard: i didn't go anywhere, john. You went. All right, thisthis is gonna hurt. It'll be a lot worse if you move, okay? Hold still.
[locke inhales sharply. Squishing sounds accompany richard's probing with the tweezers. ]
locke: uhh!
[richard extracts the bullet. ]
richard: all done.
Locke: [panting] jeez.
[instruments clatter as richard packs up again. ]
locke: i don't understand. Howhow did you know that i was here? How did you know where to find me?
Richard: i wish i had time to explain it, john. But you're gonna be moving on soon, and we need to go over a couple of things before you do.
Locke: "moving on"? Aah!
[richard presses gauze to john's leg. ]
richard: sorry. The first thing, okay?
[locke groans. ]
richard: you're gonna need to clean out the wound every couple of hours and keep as much weight off the leg as you can, all right? The island'll do the rest, john, all right?
Locke: but i don't
richard: second thingno, no, pay attention. Next time we see each other, i'm not gonna recognize you. All right? You give me this. All right?
[richard hands locke something small, something we've seen before. ]
locke: what is this?
Richard: it's a compass.
Locke: what does it do?
Richard: it points north, john. Look, i wish i had time to be more sensitive about this because it's a lot to swallow, but you need to know it in order to do what you gotta do. So i'm just gonna say it, okay? [sighs] the only way to save the island, john, is to get your people back herethe ones who left.
Locke: jack, kate... The chopper was headed for the boat. The boat
richard: no, they're fine, john, and they're already home, so you have to convince them to come back.
Locke: howhow am i supposed to do that?
Richard: you're gonna have to die, john.
[a loud high-pitched humming turns rumbling, and locke pulls an arm over his eyes to shield them from the light. The rumbling stops. Birds chirping. It is light, and locke is alone again, on bare earth, unsheltered by the beechcraft. He looks into his palm at the pocket compass, and pants. ]
act 5
[back at the hatch. Birds call in the distance. ]
miles: so... What was this thing before you guys blew it up?
Juliet: a dharma station.
Miles: for what?
Juliet: there was a man named desmond living down in it. He was pushing a button every 108 minutes to save the world.
Miles: really?
Juliet: yeah. Really.
[all hold their heads in pain as buzzing becomes magnetic humming, crackling, pulsating, loud rumbling... ]
sawyer: son of a...
[the high-pitched rumbling continues, then the rumbling stops and the bright light vanishes. Birds are heard calling. ]
sawyer: ... Bitch!
[juliet notes that there is no longer a gaping hole in the ground before them, and bends down to spread apart some foliage and brush away the earth with her hands to reveal metal. She hits her palm upon it with a clank. ]
juliet: the hatchit's back. I guess you haven't found it yet.
[sawyer starts walking away. ]
miles: hey! Where you goin'?
Sawyer: back door. I'm gettin' some supplies.
[faraday follows him. ]
faraday: james, wait. Not a good idea.
Sawyer: the sky can flash all it wants, but i ain't startin' over, dilbert. I ain't rubbin' two sticks together and starting a fire, and i ain't huntin' damn boar! There's dharma food, beer, and clothing in there. And i'm gettin' desmond to let me in one way or another.
Faraday: that's not gonna work, my friend.
Sawyer: yeah? Why not?
Faraday: because desmond didn't know you when he first came out of there. That means you've never met, which means you can't meet.
Sawyer: that would all be fascinating if i was listening to ya.
Faraday: so how do you know desmond is even in there? Think about it. It could be anybody.
[sawyer stops and turns to faraday. ]
sawyer: i don't care who's in there.
Faraday: wait. Wait.
[sawyer pounds on the door. ]
sawyer: open the damn door!
Faraday: it won't work.
Sawyer: sure it will. Yo, open up! It's the ghost of christmas future!
Faraday: no oneno one is gonna answer.
Sawyer: open! Open the damn door! Open the door!
[sawyer keeps banging. ]
faraday: you're wasting your time.
Sawyer: open up! I know you can hear me.
Faraday: if it didn't happen, it can't happen.
[sawyer tries pulling at the door. ]
sawyer: open the damn door!
Faraday: you can't change the past, james!
[sawyer spins around and grabs faraday by the shirt. ]
sawyer: everybody i care about just blew up on your damn boat. I know what i can't change.
[juliet steps up to separate the two men. ]
juliet: [to faraday] we should get back to the beach. It's been a long day.
[sawyer lets go and trods off. ]
miles: why are we going back to the beach if there's nothing to go back to?
Juliet: so stay here.
Miles: [to charlotte] that chick likes me.
[faraday sighs deeply, looking at charlotte. ]
charlotte: what? Whwhat? What's the matter?
Faraday: you... [sighs, signaling to her upper lip, which is dripping with blood from a nostril]
charlotte: ugh. I haven't had a nosebleed since i was little. Dan, i'm fine.
Faraday: yeah. No, no, no, you'reum, of course you're fine. I'm, uh... You know, the sight of blood is...
Charlotte: yeah, well, it's a good thing you're a physicist then, isn't it? Shall we?
Faraday: yeah, um... My pack. Of course i left my pack back at the hatch crater. I better get it. Why don't you head back with everyone else? And i'll be right behind you.
Charlotte: don't dillydally.
Faraday: i wouldn't think of it.
[charlotte chuckles. Faraday sighs. He runs for his pack, and extracts the journal, then quickly leafs through it. ]
[moments later, faraday bangs on the back door of the hatch. ]
faraday: [whispering, and stepping back] please let this work. Please let this work. Please, please, please, let this work.
[he moves forward to pound on the door again. The door bursts open with a creak and a man in a hazmat suit emerges, pointing a rifle at faraday. The gun cocks. ]
faraday: oh! Oh! Whoa! Whoa. Don't shoot.
Man: [scottish accent, filtered voice] then you'd best explain why you've been bangin' on my door for the last 20 minutes, brother.
Faraday: [sighs] desmond.
Desmond: [lowering the gun slightly] are you him?
Faraday: "him"? Who?
Desmond: my replacement.
Faraday: no, i'm not.
[desmond points the gun back at faraday. ]
faraday: i'm not. I'm not. I'm...
Desmond: do i know you?
Faraday: yeah... In a way. But listen, that's not important. What is important, desmond, is what i'm about to say to you. I need you to listen. You're the only person who can help us because, desmond... The rules... The rules don't apply to you. You're special. You're uniquely and miraculously special.
Desmond: what are you talking about?
[a high-pitched buzzing begins and faraday looks at the sky. He pants. ]
faraday: okay, listen to me. Listen! If the helicopter somehow made it off the island, if you got home
desmond: what helicopter? What are you talking about? !
[as faraday speaks, the humming gets louder. ]
faraday: listen, i need you to listen, or people are gonna die. My name is daniel faraday, and right now me and everyone else you left behindwe're in serious danger. You're the only person who can help us. I need you to go back to oxford university. Go back to where we met.
[the humming is now loud rumbling, and the bright light is enveloping everything. ]
faraday: i need you to go there and find my mother. Her name is
[the rumbling stops. In a bed, desmond mutters. A lamp clicks on. Desmond pants awake and looks over at his bed-partner. ]
penny: are you all right?
Desmond: [softly] i was on the island.
[desmond continues panting. ]
desmond: i was on the island.
Penny: you've been off the island for three years now.
[she kisses him on the shoulder. ]
penny: you're safe now. It was just a dream.
Desmond: it wasn't a dream, pen.
[desmond looks at her solemnly, then whispers: ]
desmond: it was a memory.
[desmond emerges from the inside of the sailboat the two are on, pulling on a shirt. Penny follows him on deck. ]
penny: desmond, where are you going? Des?
[desmond fits a handle into a crank at the prow, and the chain rattles as he begins pulling up anchor. ]
penny: desmond? What are you doing?
Desmond: we're leaving.
Penny: leaving to go where?
[the rattling continues. ]
desmond: oxford.
Act 1
[scene opens black with a blip sound; eye opens; green cursor on computer screen; unknown man enters numbers and presses 'execute' button. He goes through a morning routine and injects himself with something from an rx bottle that has the numbers on the label. He hears an explosion, gets weapons from a vault, turns the lights down, looks through a scope, adjusts mirrors so he can see the hatch area. Camera pans up to jack and locke looking down. ]
act 2
[hurley and kate standing near the hatch. ]
hurley: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. 4, 8, we're dead, 15, doomed and dead, 16, 23, 42...
Kate: hurley, you okay?
Hurley: huh? Yeah, awesome. I just have to pee. [as kate moves forward to peek into the hatch] great idea, dude, go look into the burning death hole.
[kate, jack, and locke peering into the hatch. ]
kate: what is it?
Jack: it doesn't matter what it is. We blew the door so we could get everyone inside this thing so we could be safe. That plan is not going to work. We'll never get everyone down in time.
[locke drops a rock into the hatch. ]
kate: water.
Locke: it's shallow. It sounds like a puddle.
Kate: 40 feet down?
Locke: 50 tops. If we could use the wire we pulled from the fuselage -- rig up a harness...
Jack: john, we're leaving now.
Hurley: yes, good idea. Let's do that.
Locke: we all went through a lot to get here, jack.
Jack: the ladder's broken. You going to lower 40 people down there one by one? They're waiting for us to come back and tell them what to do, so let's forget about the harnesses.
Kate: jack?
Jack: what?
Locke: why don't we all just calm down here.
Jack: look, if you want to go exploring in the morning that's fine, but tonight we're done. I'm going to go get the dynamite that we didn't use and we're heading back to the caves. How about you pack it up, john?
Locke: sure, of course.
Jack: okay.
Locke: why don't you want to go down there, jack?
[flashback - jack in the hospital er -- woman being wheeled in on gurney. ]
emt: female, late 20's, no id, she coded twice on the way over here.
Nurse: where's the other one?
Emt: right behind us. They're on their way -- fire department had to use the jaws.
Intern: what do we got here?
Nurse: female, late 20s...
Intern: [referring to a piece of metal sticking in the patient's breast] what the hell is that?
Jack: [entering] piece of the steering column. All right, let's go. Keep that collar steady. Page my father.
Intern: already did.
Jack: [to emt] tell me.
Emt: her tire blew, car jumped the divider, went head-on with an suv.
Nurse: bp's dropping.
Jack: pericardial's pierced. Was she driving?
Emt: yes, alone.
Jack: where's the driver of the suv?
[a man is wheeled in on a gurney. ]
emt #2: adam rutherford, 57, chest trauma, no breath sounds.
Jack: [to intern] tube mr. Rutherford while i...
Intern: i can't intubate, you've got to.
Nurse: dr. Shephard, her bp's 80 over 60.
Nurse #2: dr. Shephard, his breathing's deteriorating.
Jack: [deciding to work on the woman] okay, need a syringe -- big one. You, hold pressure. [he pulls the piece of the steering column out of the woman's chest. ]
nurse: 88 over 52, no radial pulse.
Jack: i know. I know -- sac's flooded. Where's that...
Nurse: [handing him a syringe] right here. Got it?
Jack: yep.
Nurse #2: doctor, we're losing him.
[jack continues working on the woman as we hear the sound of adam rutherford's heart monitor flat-lining. ]
nurse: bp stabilizing.
Nurse #2: time of death 8:15am.
Jack: okay, get me a blood gas and a c-spine. Get her up to icu and keep her immobilized.
[we see that the woman jack has been working on is sarah. ]
sarah: [whispering weakly] i want to dance at my wedding.
Intern: did you hear that?
Nurse: sweetie, you need to take it easy, okay. Just relax.
Intern: what did she say?
Jack: she said she has to dance at her wedding.
[on-island - the people at the caves. ]
charlie: okay, no one is out there. No one is coming.
N. D. Survivor: but the -- but the french woman said...
Charlie: the french woman is missing a bloody wing nut, you know. I mean, i mean, it was all bollocks. It's a ghost story. She set the fire herself. [charlie sees sayid looking at him. ] what?
Sayid: nothing.
Shannon: [to various redshirts] has anyone seen vincent -- the dog? Anyone seen him? Has anyone seen the dog?
Redshirt: no.
Sayid: where are you going?
Shannon: i lost the damn dog.
[at the hatch - locke is looking down it with a pleased expression. ]
hurley: why'd you do that? Why'd you light the fuse, man?
Locke: why wouldn't i light the fuse?
Hurley: ah, maybe because i was running towards you, waving my arms, yelling "don't do that? "
locke: [laughing] well, you've got a point there. I guess i was just excited to get inside. I mean, that's why we came here, isn't it? That's why we went all the way out to the black rock -- and why we got the dynamite to blow the hatch. And we did it so that we could get inside, hugo.
Jack: and to save everybody's lives.
Locke: and to save everyone's lives.
Jack: or, maybe it was just our destiny, right, john?
Locke: maybe.
Kate: guys, it's the hatch door, you'd better see this.
[the word "quarantine" is stenciled on the inside of the hatch door. ]
[shannon and sayid in the jungle. ]
shannon: vincent!
Sayid: this is not a good idea.
Shannon: i saw him 5 minutes ago. Besides, you're the one who said there isn't anyone out here.
Sayid: i said we didn't see anyone. The dog will come back on his own. He always does.
Shannon: watching that dog was the one thing anyone has ever asked me to do. If something happens to him...
Sayid: when was the last time you slept or had something to eat? You're exhausted.
Shannon: i can't tell that kid that i lost his dog because i was exhausted.
[sound of vincent barking in the background. Sayid and shannon try to flank him but he runs off and they follow. ]
sayid: i'll circle around behind him.
Shannon: okay.
Sayid: vincent!
Shannon: sayid! [shannon loses sight of him. ] sayid! Sayid, where are you? ! Sayid! Sayid!
[shannon falls and camera does several quick pans around. Then she sees the apparition of a water-soaked walt standing nearby. ]
shannon: walt?
[walt shushes her. ]
shannon: what are you doing here?
[walt whispers something unintelligible backwards. Shannon looks away and when she looks back walt is gone. ]
sayid: shannon! What is it? What?
Act 3
[locke and kate walking back to the caves. ]
kate: why do you want to get down there so bad?
Locke: -ly. Why do i want to get down there so badly. Jack thinks i'm crazy, doesn't he?
Kate: why, because you want to drop into a hatch that's been locked from the inside by a foot-thick steel door that says "quarantine? "
locke: well, look at the bright side. The damage is done.
Kate: the bright side?
Locke: and if jack thinks i've lost it, i can't blame him, really. Then again, 5 hours ago i was pulled into a hole by what appeared to be a column of black smoke. Did you see it, kate? [the look on her face indicates that she did. ] then i guess we're both crazy. Wonder what jack thinks he saw?
[jack and hurley walking back to the caves. ]
hurley: you should go ahead, man -- don't want locke making time with your girl. [jack shoots him a look] joke, dude.
Jack: i'm not really in the mood, hurley.
Hurley: really? Wow, usually you're, like, mr. Haha. [jack chuckles. ] there you go. Life's not so bad, right? I mean, sure the others are coming to, like, eat us all -- and every once in a while someone blows up all over you, but you do get to sleep in every morning.
Jack: uh-huh. And the numbers?
Hurley: what?
Jack: "the numbers are bad" -- that's what you were yelling right when i tackled you.
Hurley: yeah, that's kind of a long story.
Jack: i've got time.
Hurley: you'll think i'm crazy.
Jack: try me.
Hurley: awhile ago i was in this kind of psych ward, and there was this guy, leonard -- and all the time i knew him all he ever said were these numbers -- 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42 -- over and over and over again. And they kind of got stuck in my head. So, when i got out -- well, actually a couple of months after i got out -- i was buying a frozen burrito and i thought, hey, i should play the lottery. And i guess those numbers were still stuck in my head so i played them. And i won 114 million dollars. That's when it started happening -- my grandpa died, my house caught on fire, the chicken joint that i worked at got hit by a meteor -- well, actually meteorite. Okay, so tonight i see the same freaking numbers on the hatch thing -- just written on the side -- and that's why i tried to stop it -- because that thing is cursed, man.
Jack: you were in a psych ward?
Hurley: i'm not crazy.
Jack: i'm not saying you are.
Hurley: so, what? That's it? That's all?
Jack: what do you want me to say?
Hurley: how about you believe me, man?
Jack: hurley, they're numbers.
Hurley: what's that thing where doctors make you feel better just by talking to you?
Jack: bedside manner.
Hurley: yeah, that. Yours sucks, dude.
[flashback - jack in the hospital looking at sarah's chart as she comes to. ]
sarah: what happened to him?
Jack: just try to relax, okay?
Sarah: the car that i hit -- the other driver was older.
Jack: he died in the er.
Sarah: i can't feel anything.
Jack: i know.
Sarah: what's happened to me?
Jack: you have a fracture-dislocation of your thoracic lumbar spine with multiple crushed vertebrae -- your back is broken. Your spleen is ruptured and bleeding into your abdomen and that has to be stopped. [shot of christian shephard looking through a window at jack and sarah. ] i'm going to perform surgery and repair as much damage as possible. But even the most optimistic result puts the likelihood of retaining any feeling or mobility anywhere below the waist at "extremely unlikely".
Sarah: oh.
Christian shephard: dr. Shephard, may i have a word, please.
[jack and christian walk down the corridor. ]
jack: so, what did i do wrong?
Christian shephard: you did something wrong?
Jack: you're frowning.
Christian shephard: my face is always this way.
Jack: dad, hey, c'mon, let's hear it.
Christian shephard: you might want to try handing out some hope every once in awhile. Even if there's a 99 percent probability that they're utterly, hopelessly screwed, folks are much more inclined to hear that 1 percent chance that things are going to be okay.
Jack: her spine's crushed. I tell her that everything's going to be okay -- that's false hope, dad.
Christian shephard: maybe. Maybe, but it's still hope.
[on-island - back at the caves. ]
shannon: i know what i saw! It was him! It was walt!
Sayid: shannon, please lower your voice. You'll upset the rest of the group.
Shannon: i heard whispers.
Claire: where?
Shannon: everywhere.
Charlie: what -- what whispers? Who?
Shannon: i don't know -- them.
Sun: do you think something happened to the raft?
Sayid: nothing happened to the raft. Walt is with your husband, with sawyer...
Shannon: sayid, i know what i saw.
Charlie: [as the hatch group enters] they're back.
[jack stands in front of the group to give a speech. ]
jack: uh, locke found, uh, a hatch in the ground about a half a mile from here. We left to -- to blow it open so that we could hide inside -- so all of us could hide inside, in case... But that doesn't matter now because it's not going to work. There's no way for all of us to get down in there tonight.
Charlie: jack, where's dr. Arzt?
Jack: um, he didn't make it.
Shannon: did you see them? Did you see the others?
Charlie: hey, shannon, there are no others. We've already had this conversation.
Shannon: what the hell would you know about it -- just because you didn't see anything? !
Charlie: there's no one out there.
Shannon: you don't know!
Charlie: you're just making up rubbish!
Jack: hey! Everything's going to be okay. Let's just take it easy. We're going to be alright. We're going to stay here tonight, okay, together. We've still got 4 guns. We'll put lookouts at all the entrances. We're all going to be safe as long as we stay together. The sun comes up in 3 hours and we're all going to be here to see that happen. I promise. [locke enters carrying a cable. ] john, what are you doing?
Locke: i'm getting some cable.
Jack: what for?
Locke: it's for the hatch. I'm going in.
Jack: do you really think that's the smartest thing to do right now, john?
Locke: i doubt it. In fact, you're right. The safest thing is to stay here -- wait for morning -- wait for these others, to see if they ever show up -- wait for the brave folks on the raft to bring help -- but me, i'm tired of waiting. [locke exits. ]
act 4
[close-up of jack off by himself at the caves, kate enters. ]
kate: so, do you believe it?
Jack: believe what?
Kate: that everything's going to be okay?
Jack: yeah, i do.
Kate: kind of unlike you -- the whole glass half-full thing.
Jack: there's a glass?
[both laugh. ]
kate: you did a good thing saying what you said -- taking care of everybody and just giving them something to count on. If you weren't here, jack... [long pause] i'm going to the hatch. I understand why you can't go. They need you here. I get it. I do. But locke's going into that thing whether you like it or not. And if he falls and breaks his neck... Live together, die alone, right?
Jack: right.
[flashback - jack and sarah's fiance, kevin, in jack's office. ]
jack: your fiance was seriously injured. It could take as long as 10, maybe 12 hours. I won't know how extensive the damage is until i get inside.
Kevin: she was going for a dress fitting and to look at tablecloths.
Jack: when is it -- the wedding?
Kevin: it's 8 months.
Jack: well, i'm sure sarah will have recovered by then.
Kevin: recovered - um, what does that mean?
Jack: there will be ongoing physical therapy, but if she works really hard...
Kevin: well, well, will we be able to, you know, make love?
Jack: you need to know that there's a chance sarah might very well need professional care for the rest of her life.
Kevin: like, she won't be able to go to the bathroom by herself?
[jack and sarah in the or. ]
sarah: [with low voice] come here. Come here. I want to tell you a little secret. Come on. Closer. It's okay. I know i'm not going to be dancing anymore. I can still roll around at my wedding. And you're invited, okay.
Jack: i'm going to fix you.
[on-island - locke at the hatch. Kate enters. ]
kate: i expected to find you half way down there by now.
Locke: i was waiting for you.
[some time later. ]
kate: so, you want me to go down first?
Locke: well, you're lighter. I can belay you down and bring you back up just as easy. The shaft might get narrower down there, too.
Kate: you left out the part where you just want to see if i get eaten by something.
Locke: yeah, well, that too. [he fastens the cable harness around kate. ] not too tight?
Kate: got it. -- okay. [she starts climbing down the ladder. ] wait, what do i say if i need to stop?
Locke: stop.
Kate: hmm, okay. Let's go.
[as locke is lowering her down, one of the trees holding the harness breaks and locke barely holds on. ]
locke: kate, are you alright? !
Kate: yeah, i dropped the light! Maybe we should... [locke continues lowering her down. ] well, okay then. 1, 2, 3, 4. [a light goes on inside the hatch. ] stop!
Locke: what is it? !
Kate: john, i think there's something down here!
[kate screams and a floodlight turns on. ]
locke: kate, are you alright? !
[locke struggles as something pulls at the other end of the cable. Locke falls back as kate's weight is taken from the cable. The floodlight goes out. ]
locke: kate! Kate! Kate!
Act 5
[hurley and jack at the caves. ]
hurley: you're kidding, right? You're going back?
Jack: [loading a gun] yeah.
Hurley: what about all that stuff you said about waiting 'til morning and watching the sun rise?
Jack: i changed my mind.
[jack at the hatch. ]
jack: kate! Locke!
[getting no reply, jack starts climbing down into the hatch. ]
[flashback - jack running the steps at a stadium. Another person comes into view running faster than jack. Jack tries to keep pace but hurts his ankle. ]
jack: ow, damn it.
Desmond: you alright, brother?
Jack: i'm fine. I'm fine.
Desmond: take it easy. Keep the weight off. Here, let me have a look. Does this hurt? [jack shakes his head. ] you haven't sprained it then. I don't fancy your chances of catching up with me tonight, though.
Jack: i wasn't trying to catch up.
Desmond: aye, of course you weren't.
Jack: what do you know about sprains, anyway?
Desmond: i was almost a doctor once.
Jack: small world.
Desmond: you a doctor then? [jack nods. Desmond offers jack his water bottle. ] so what's your excuse?
Jack: excuse?
Desmond: for running like the devil's chasing you. My excuse - i'm training.
Jack: training for what?
Desmond: for a race around the world. Impressive, i know. So your excuse better be good, brother.
Jack: just trying to work a few things out.
Desmond: ah, a girl, right?
Jack: a patient.
Desmond: ah, but a girl patient. What's her name?
Jack: her name's sarah.
Desmond: what'd you do to her then?
Jack: do to her?
Desmond: you must have done something worthy of this self-flagellation.
Jack: i told her -- i made a promise i couldn't keep -- i told her i'd fix her and i couldn't. I failed.
Desmond: well, right. Just one thing -- what if you did fix her?
Jack: i didn't.
Desmond: but what if you did?
Jack: you don't know what you're talking about, man.
Desmond: i don't? Why not?
Jack: because with her situation that would be a miracle, brother.
Desmond: oh, and you don't believe in miracles? [jack chuckles and shakes his head. ] right. Well then, i'm going to give you some advice anyway. You have to lift it up. (he may be saying "lift her up". )
jack: lift it up?
Desmond: your ankle. You've got to keep it elevated. It's been nice chatting.
Jack: jack.
Desmond: jack, i'm desmond. Good luck, brother. See you in another life, yeah?
[on-island - jack explores the inside of the hatch coming upon a lab room with computer equipment. ]
locke: [as jack is about to press the 'execute' button on the computer] i wouldn't do that, jack.
Jack: [pointing his gun at locke] where is kate? What the hell did you...
[a gun comes into frame pointed at locke's head. ]
act 6
[flashback - jack in sarah's hospital room as she comes to. ]
sarah: am i alive?
Jack: yeah. Yeah, you're alive.
Sarah: you smell.
Jack: well, thank you.
Sarah: wow, you really smell.
Jack: yeah, i -- i went for a run.
Sarah: you smell like you ran far.
Jack: i showered. I mean, i guess i just didn't cool. I -- i wanted to get back down here and check on you. It was a tour de stade.
Sarah: what?
Jack: it is when you run all the steps in every section of a stadium up and down.
Sarah: why would you do that?
Jack: i'm -- i'm intense.
Sarah: did you finish?
Jack: no, i hurt my ankle.
Sarah: that sucks for you. Is kevin here, my fiance?
Jack: i didn't see him.
Sarah: i'm, i'm sure he'll be back in awhile.
Jack: yeah. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Sarah: you going to tell me how it went?
Jack: sarah, the -- the damage to your back was extensive. I did everything i could but your spinal column... I just -- i couldn't repair it. [he's starting to cry. ] you're going to be paralyzed from the waist down for the rest of your life. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry, sarah.
Sarah: you're yanking my chain, right?
Jack: no.
Sarah: then how come i can wiggle my toes?
[jack checks the nerve response in her legs. ]
jack: can you feel this?
Sarah: yes.
Jack: can you feel this?
Sarah: yes.
Jack: [getting more emotional each time] this?
Sarah: yes.
Jack: this?
Sarah: yes.
[on-island - in the hatch. ]
gunman's voice: move and i kill him. Put the gun down.
Jack: where's kate?
Locke: jack, it's okay.
Gunman's voice: i said drop it!
Jack: where's kate? !
Locke: she's fine, just put down the...
Jack: i'm not putting anything...
Gunman's voice: [firing the gun overhead] do you want him to die? Put it down.
Jack: is this what you were talking about, locke? Is this your destiny? All roads lead here?
Locke: jack, calm down.
Gunman's voice: [as he moves behind locke] lower your gun or i'll blow his damned head off, brother!
Jack: [recognizing that it's desmond] you.
Act 1
[the tail section of the plane crashes into the water near the beach. ]
[day 1]
[general chaos of people struggling to make it to the beach. Then we see ana break the surface and take a deep breath. Other survivors are on the beach and in the water. Ana swims for shore. Eko drags a woman out of the ocean. Ana swims out to help. Eko carries a boy, zack, out of the water. ]
zach: emma -- my sister, my sister. Emma! Emma!
[eko goes back in the water to rescue emma and brings her to the beach. Ana sees her and leaves a man lying on the beach to go to help with emma. ]
ana lucia: i'll be right back.
Eko: she's not breathing.
Ana: watch out.
[ana begins cpr. Eko sees the boy watching. ]
eko: come with me.
[zach drops his teddy bear by his sister while ana administers chest compressions on emma. ]
eko: [to zach] don't look. She will be fine.
[emma spits up water and regains consciousness. ]
ana lucia: good, let it out. You okay?
Emma: where's my mom?
Ana lucia: i don't know.
Emma: she's meeting us in los angeles.
Yelling man: help! Help! Anybody see my wife? Pam!
Ana lucia: we're not there yet. I promise, we're going to get you home soon, okay.
[scene of general chaos and yelling on the beach. ]
act 2
[cindy on the beach looking tired. ]
eko: excuse me, would you look after the children? There is something i have to do.
Cindy: uh, okay.
Eko: [to emma] stay with this nice woman. I'll be back in a minute.
[eko starts hauling dead bodies out of the ocean. Scene switches to libby caring for a man with a badly broken leg. ]
donald: ow, my leg, my leg! Is it bad? It's bad, isn't it?
Libby: no, it's not that bad. I broke my leg skiing up at stowe in vermont. I was on this run -- going pretty fast -- i was racing this cute ski patrol guy. I went off this mogul, lost my edge and, bam!
[libby twists the guy's leg to try to set the bone. He screams. Ana looks on, shocked. The guy passes out. ]
libby: snapped my left leg. Now that -- that was bad.
Ana lucia: you a doctor?
Libby: a year of med school before i dropped out. I'm a clinical psychologist. You saved that girl's life -- you a doctor?
Ana lucia: no.
Goodwin: [appearing] help! Hey, i need some help! There's somebody in the jungle, come on. He's alive!
[ana runs to help. ]
bernard: help! Please help me! Help! Help!
[bernard is strapped into an airline seat, sitting next to a dead guy. The seats are precariously perched in a tree. ]
goodwin: we should climb up there -- i'll hold him steady, you pull him...
Ana lucia: no, wait. [yelling to bernard] what's your name? !
Bernard: bernard!
Ana lucia: you're going to be alright, bernard. I need you to unbuckle your seat belt and grab the branch next to you!
Bernard: [referring to the guy next to him] is he dead? I think he's dead.
Goodwin: we should climb up there.
Ana lucia: no. [to bernard] i need you to focus, bernard! Unbuckle your seatbelt! [he does so, shakily] now grab the branch next to you!
Bernard: i don't think i can do that.
Ana lucia: those seats are going to fall.
[bernard reaches for the tree. ]
ana lucia: come on, you can do it. Bernard!
[the seats fall to the ground. We see bernard clinging to the tree. ]
ana lucia: alright, hold on tight, okay! I'm coming up to get you!
[back on the beach. ]
libby: does anybody have any water?
[goodwin trying to start a fire with a hand drill type device. ]
ana lucia: [entering] you couldn't find any matches?
Goodwin: dry ones? You can ask around but i couldn't find any. It'll be dark soon, let me get a signal fire started so they can find us.
Ana lucia: what are you, a boy scout?
Goodwin: grown up version -- i'm in the peace corps.
Ana lucia: they still have that?
Goodwin: i'm just happy somebody your age actually knows what it is.
Ana lucia: what's your name?
Goodwin: goodwin.
Ana lucia: i'm ana lucia.
[scene switches to night, around a fire at the beach. Bernard approaches eko, who's off by himself a little ways. ]
bernard: i heard that you were the one who pulled the dead bodies out of the water.
Eko: yes.
Bernard: were any of them african-american?
Eko: no.
Bernard: oh, it's my wife -- i can't find her.
Eko: i will pray for her.
Bernard: where the hell are the rescue planes?
Eko: i will pray for them, too.
[at the beach, everyone is sleeping. We hear strange noises and people awaken. ]
ana lucia: what was that?
[goodwin grabs a stick out of the fire and runs. ]
ana lucia: libby, watch the kids.
Goodwin: over here.
Libby: [to the kids] it's alright. It'll be okay.
[ana and goodwin come upon a bloody eko and two dead bodies. ]
ana lucia: what happened?
[eko shows he has killed them with a big rock. ]
act 3
[day 2]
[eko looks upset. Ana examines the bodies. ]
ana lucia: no wallets, no cell phone, no keys. Nothing.
[eko, off to himself at the shore, takes off his bloody shirt. ]
ana: [to eko] hey, are you okay?
[eko says nothing. ]
nathan: [entering] look, 3 of the people are missing -- the blond guy, the curly-haired guy, and the german who was helping us with the injured.
Ana lucia: did you see anything?
Nathan: no, i didn't.
Ana lucia: where did they come from? How many there were?
Nathan: no, i didn't see anything. Who are these people?
Ana lucia: i don't know. They're out here in the jungle with no shoes, nothing in their pockets, no labels on their clothes. These people were here before us.
[eko is fashioning a walking stick/club while ana speaks. ]
ana lucia: we need to get off the beach. We need to find a safer place.
Nathan: we've got kids and people that are seriously hurt. Where are we going to go? How are we going to move them? And what about the signal fire? How are we going to get rescued if we're off the beach?
Goodwin: nathan's right.
Ana lucia: they have satellites -- the black box -- we don't need a fire for them to find us.
Cindy: yes, we do. Before the crash, the pilot said we'd lost communication; we were turning back. We were flying for two hours in the wrong direction. They don't know where to look.
[day 3]
[goodwin trying to open some shellfish. Other people on the beach collecting shellfish. Ana removing the arms of her leather jacket. ]
libby: it's donald, his leg. The infection is getting worse. He'll be the 4th to go.
Ana lucia: what are we supposed to do about that?
[day 5]
[donald gets buried amongst other graves at the beach. ]
[day 7]
[the castaways catch a chicken. Eko is off by himself carving something into his club. ]
libby: [sitting down next to eko] would you like some chicken? You haven't said a word in a week. Why aren't you talking? Hey, it wasn't your fault, you know. You were just defending yourself.
[day 12]
[ana trying to create a sharp edge on a wooden weapon. ]
goodwin: that'll work.
Ana lucia: eh, i heard a pig or something out there. Maybe we can have some bacon tomorrow. [she looks at the kids, and notices goodwin staring at her] what?
[nathan comes from the jungle to the beach. ]
ana lucia: where were you?
Nathan: i had to go to the bathroom.
Ana lucia: we have a system for that. We go in pairs.
Nathan: yeah, sorry.
[at night on the beach, a roaring fire. Everybody sleeping. The camp is attacked and the kids and some adults are taken. ]
unknown voice: behind you! Behind you!
Emma: help us, please!
Libby: the kids! They took the kids!
[ana charges one of the attackers and hits her with a rock. ]
libby: they took jim! And eli! Nancy's gone! They're gone!
Ana lucia: which way did they go? Which way did they go? ! ! [grabbing the "other" she just hit with a rock] wake up! Wake up! ! Who are you? Talk to me. Wake up!
Goodwin: she's dead. She's dead.
[ana starts going through her clothes. ]
goodwin: what are you doing? [ana finds a knife] is that a knife?
[ana finds a piece of paper and unfolds it. ]
goodwin: what is that?
Ana lucia: it's a list.
Libby: a list of what?
Ana lucia: 9 -- of us.
Act 4
[on the beach. ]
ana: [to eko] nothing? They drag 9 people into the jungle -- the kids -- and there's no sign of them? [eko doesn't speak] now's not a good time to talk? What needs to happen to make you say something? !
Nathan: hey, calm down, let's figure this out.
Ana lucia: calm down? Let's figure this out? Here are the names of every single person they took -- all 9 of them -- what they were wearing -- what they look like -- one of them had a list of us.
Nathan: they could have gotten our names from the people they already took.
Ana lucia: nobody knew anybody's names the first night.
Nathan: maybe they're watching us?
Ana lucia: you were gone for 2 hours yesterday.
Nathan: what?
Ana lucia: where were you?
Nathan: i was going to the bathroom.
Goodwin: hey, stop! We're all scared. Let's not get paranoid here. We don't know anything.
Bernard: he's right. Why would they try to infiltrate us -- that's crazy.
Libby: well, whoever they are they know we are here. We need to leave this beach.
Ana: [to goodwin] you said we needed to keep the signal fire burning.
Goodwin: i think it's time we let it go out.
[day 15]
[trekking through the woods. They stop at a stream. ]
ana lucia: 5 minutes.
Bernard: we've been walking for 3 days straight, ana.
Ana lucia: and you're still here. 5 minutes.
Nathan: you know what? You want to keep walking, go ahead -- fresh water -- rock wall at our backs -- lots of fruit trees -- right here looks pretty good to me.
Ana lucia: fine, okay. This'll work.
[day 17]
[ana digging out the pit. ]
libby: [entering] hey.
Ana lucia: hey.
Libby: back at the beach -- the night they came back -- you said that nathan was gone for 2 hours? That he was missing? Creeps me out, ana. Do you really think it's possible that one of us is one of them?
Ana lucia: why do you think i'm digging this hole?
[day 19]
[bernard and nathan setting a trap. ]
bernard: are we really going to be able to catch rabbits with this?
Nathan: oh yeah, give me another stick.
Bernard: [to ana, entering] oh, hey, ana.
[ana kicks nathan in the head and knocks him out. ]
bernard: ana? !
[ana carries nathan to the pit and throws him in. ]
nathan: what are you doing?
Ana lucia: you and i are going to have little talk, nathan.
Nathan: you, let me out of here right now. You let me out. You let me out!
[ana closes the pit cover. ]
ana lucia: he wasn't on the plane.
Bernard: what?
Ana lucia: we were in the air for 2 hours -- i didn't see him once -- not once.
Goodwin: it's a big plane, ana, just because you didn't...
Cindy: no, i didn't see him either. I'm pretty good with faces, you know, with the passengers, and i did not see him.
Goodwin: you're not all serious.
Libby: he never talks about himself, nathan. Every time i ask him anything, he just dodges.
Bernard: no, if he really were one of them why would he still be here?
Ana lucia: i don't know, but i'm going to find out.
Nathan: [faintly in the background] will you let me out, ana?
Ana: [to eko] you got a problem with this?
Nathan: [faintly in the background] what are you doing? Let me out.
[night time. Ana opens the cover of the pit. ]
ana lucia: where are the kids? Where are the kids? Where are you from, nathan?
Nathan: canada.
Ana lucia: what were you doing in australia?
Nathan: company retreat.
Ana lucia: where are they?
Nathan: what?
Ana lucia: the rest of your retreat -- where are they?
Nathan: they weren't on the plane. I stayed a couple extra days to sight-see.
Ana lucia: how come nobody saw you on the plane, nathan?
Nathan: i was in the lavatory.
Ana lucia: for 2 hours?
Nathan: i don't remember seeing you on the plane, ana lucia.
Ana lucia: that's because you weren't on it.
[ana replaces the cover on the pit. ]
[day 23]
[back at the pit. ]
ana lucia: where are the kids, nathan? Where are the kids? Not talking to me anymore? What's that behind you? Get up! [ana throws a rock] i said get up! [some banana skins are revealed. ]
ana: [to the rest of the group] who gave him food?
Cindy: what happened?
Ana lucia: i'm trying to find out what they did to us. [to bernard] and you're taking care of him?
Bernard: i didn't do anything. And what if you're wrong, ana? We don't even know if there is a spy.
Ana lucia: whose idea was it to stay at the beach where they could pick us off one by one -- his -- nathan's.
Libby: well, they haven't come since you put him in there.
Ana lucia: who did it?
[eko enters. ]
ana lucia: you?
[eko doesn't speak and walks off. ]
[ana drinking at the river. Goodwin joins her. ]
goodwin: i'm worried about you, ana. You've had him down there 4 days.
Ana lucia: i promised that little girl that i would get her back home to her mom.
Goodwin: do you have any kids, ana?
Ana lucia: no.
Goodwin: we should let him go. We're not savages.
Ana lucia: if i were a savage i would have cut off his finger already. That's tomorrow.
[at night. Goodwin opens the pit. ]
goodwin: grab the rope. I'll pull you up. [he pulls nathan up] ana lucia's -- i think we all think that she's going to hurt you. Now, you need to get away from here. [he hands nathan a package wrapped in leaves] there's some fruit in there, now just go.
Nathan: which way's the beach?
Goodwin: that way, maybe 5 miles.
[nathan starts to leave and goodwin breaks his neck. ]
act 5
[day 24]
[ana wakes up on the beach. Goodwin is lying beside her, watching her. ]
goodwin: morning.
Ana lucia: morning.
Cindy: [running into camp] ana lucia, he's gone!
Ana lucia: what?
Cindy: he's gone. Nathan's gone.
[everyone heads to the pit to take a look. ]
bernard: ana, what are you going to do?
Ana lucia: they found us, it's time to move.
[day 26]
[walking through the jungle. They come to the ocean. ]
[day 27]
[they find a door. ]
cindy: what is it?
Ana lucia: i don't know -- some sort of bunker.
Libby: do you think it's theirs?
[eko goes toward the door. ]
ana lucia: what are you doing?
[eko opens the door. They see the dharma arrow logo. ]
libby: what is this place?
Goodwin: it looks like some sort of storage facility.
[ana finds a control panel and turns on the lights. ]
ana lucia: hey, come over here.
[they find a chest and open it. Something falls out. ]
ana lucia: what was that? Get it.
[they find a bible and some blankets. ]
bernard: what else in here?
Libby: [finding the thing that fell] it's a glass eye.
Bernard: [holding a radio] look at this. It's a radio.
[outside, bernard tries the radio. ]
bernard: hello? Hello, can anybody hear me?
Goodwin: [grabbing the radio] the hills are blocking it. If we want a signal we need to get to higher ground. I'll do it.
Ana lucia: i'll go with you.
Goodwin: nah, you should stay here, ana -- get this place set up as a shelter.
Ana lucia: we can all get it set up. We can make it back in a couple of hours, let's go.
[ana and goodwin hiking to higher ground. ]
ana lucia: why do you think they're doing this?
Goodwin: why do i think who's doing what?
Ana lucia: them. Don't you ever wonder why they attack us?
Goodwin: maybe they're not attacking us.
Ana lucia: yeah, they just drag us into the jungle every now and then -- no real harm done.
Goodwin: good point.
Ana lucia: why do you think they take some of us and not the others?
Goodwin: that first night they took the strongest of us -- our quiet friend -- three other guys. They're all athletic, tough, threats.
Ana lucia: they didn't take you.
Goodwin: guess they changed their plan after two of them got killed. Want to take a break?
Ana lucia: yeah, that's a good idea.
Goodwin: can i have the knife?
[he takes out a mango and ana hands him the knife. He gives ana a piece of mango. ]
ana lucia: thank you. Where do you think they got it? I mean, they don't even wear shoes. How'd they get an army knife?
Goodwin: sorry?
Ana lucia: the knife -- it's u. S. Military. Here [she reaches for the knife] i'll show you. You see the tang stamp? [we see a u. S. Army stamp] this knife's probably 20 years old. You don't see these anymore, yet here it is, on this island. Weird, huh? Can i ask you something?
Goodwin: sure, ana.
Ana lucia: when you ran out of the jungle the day of the crash -- how did you find bernard up in the tree?
Goodwin: i heard him shouting from the beach.
Ana lucia: from the beach?
Goodwin: why are you asking me about that, ana?
Ana lucia: did he see you out there? Is that why you pretended to be one of us? You ran out of the jungle 10 minutes after the crash, you weren't wet. You were never even in the ocean. Where are they -- your friends? Nathan -- what did you-
goodwin: if you had cut off his finger and he still told you he was on the plane, i think maybe you would have started to believe you had the wrong guy.
Ana lucia: did you kill him?
Goodwin: nathan was not a good person. That's why he wasn't on the list.
Ana lucia: what about the kids? Did you kill them, too?
Goodwin: children are fine. They're better off now.
[ana charges goodwin and they struggle. They fall down a hill and ana impales him as he jumps on her. Ana heads back to camp. ]
cindy: where's goodwin?
Ana lucia: we're safe here now.
[day 41]
[bernard tries the radio again. ]
ana lucia: why are you wasting your time with that thing? There's no signal.
Bernard: i only turn it on a couple minutes a day. It really doesn't...
Boone: [on the radio] hello. Hello, anybody out there? Mayday. Mayday.
Bernard: is there someone there?
Boone: hello! Hello!
Cindy: who is that? Oh my god!
Boone: can you hear me?
Bernard: repeat your transmission, please.
Boone: hello. We're survivors of the crash of oceanic flight 815! Please copy!
Bernard: we're the survivors of flight 815.
[ana takes the radio. ]
bernard: no, wait a minute. What are you doing?
Ana lucia: it's them. [she turns the radio off] it's them. They're trying to draw us out -- trying to find us.
Bernard: no, he said 815; he said flight 815.
Ana lucia: they know our flight number because goodwin knew our flight number.
Bernard: what if there really are other survivors out there?
Ana lucia: there are no survivors. This is our life now. Get used to it.
[ana sitting at the stream crying. Eko sees her. ]
ana lucia: what are you looking at?
Eko: going to be okay.
Ana lucia: what, you're talking now?
Eko: it's been 40 days.
Ana lucia: you've been waiting 40 days to talk?
Eko: you waited 40 days to cry.
[ana breaks down. Eko comforts her. ]
act 6
[day 45]
[on the beach, cindy sees jin's body in the surf. ]
cindy: libby.
[cindy and libby get jin out of the water. ]
cindy: turn him over.
Libby: is he alive? Get ana lucia, quick!
[jin is tied to a tree and blindfolded. Eko removes the blindfold. ]
eko: who are you? Where are you from?
Jin: [says something in korean]
[scene switches the group talking. ]
bernard: he doesn't even speak english.
Ana lucia: that doesn't mean anything.
Cindy: ana, we found him in the water.
Ana lucia: he has a broken hand cuff on his wrist.
Eko: i'm not sure that he's a threat.
[jin breaks free and runs to the beach. ]
ana lucia: he's running!
Jin: [coming to the beach] michael, sawyer!
Sawyer: jin!
Jin: others! Others! Others!
[there's a montage of sawyer, michael, and jin being thrown into the pit. Then we see ana and eko talking. ]
ana lucia: hit me.
Eko: hit you?
Ana lucia: you think they're okay? Let's find out. Hit me.
[montage of scenes with ana in the pit. ]
[day 46. Scenes of them getting out of pit, going into the bunker. ]
[day 47. Scenes them walking in the jungle and on the beach. Sawyer in the stretcher. ]
[day 48 - today. Black screen with the sounds of a storm and ana asking "where's cindy? " they hear the whispers. We see ana shoot shannon. ]
michael: what was that? !
[reactions shots to the shooting. ]
act 1
[flashback - we see a boy arrange some tools on the ground near a car up on blocks. He opens the hood, and we see a man, david, approach carrying a duffel bag. ]
david: you got that thing running yet, buddy?
Young hurley: naw, but i got your tools all set.
David: let's see if we can get this thing started, okay?
Young hurley: i thought we needed a new carburetor?
David: well, maybe we don't. Come on, slide behind the wheel. Let's fire this up.
[they get in and he hands the keys to a reluctant hurley. ]
david: what's the matter? Go ahead.
[hurley closes his eyes and silently prays as he puts the key in the ignition. He turns the key, but it doesn't start. ]
young hurley: it's stupid. Without a new carburetor it's not going to work.
David: having hope is never stupid. You've got to believe good things will happen and then they will. You understand what i'm saying? [hurley nods] in this world, son, you've got to make your own luck. Alright, come on.
Young hurley: [getting out of the car] well, what do you want to fix today?
David: [sighing] we're going to have to put that on hold for a little while because, um, i've got to go to vegas. You know, i've got some work out there.
Young hurley: what about the road trip?
David: the grand canyon will still be there when i get back, little dude. Hey, i've got something for you. [he hands him a candy bar]
young hurley: um, i'm not supposed to, mom says.
David: live a little, hugo. It's just a candy bar. [he grabs his duffel bag] alright, i'll be back before you know it. Hold down the fort? You're my man? Alright.
[hurley starts eating the candy bar while watching his father ride away on his motorcycle. Hurley's mom watches from a window. ]
[on-island - we see hurley looking sad. ]
hurley: so then, the others take the bags off our heads and we're, like, on the other side of the island. And they take jack, kate and sawyer someplace and they sent me back to warn everyone to stay away. Which i did. And now everyone's freaked out. With them gone -- and what happened to eko -- they're all scared. And i'm scared. But then, i've been scared most of my time here anyway, except when i'm with you. I miss you, libby.
[hurley places a flower at libby's grave. ]
[charlie is on the beach shaving. He accidently cuts himself. ]
charlie: bloody hell.
Hurley: dude, you okay?
Charlie: peachy.
Hurley: really? Because you've kind of been moping...
Charlie: look, it's not worth talking about, hurley. Okay?
Hurley: you can tell me anything.
Charlie: desmond told me i was going to die. He told me has these flashes -- visions, whatever -- and in them i always die. [hurley doesn't respond] so this is the part where you tell me it is ridiculous, don't be daft, he's a nutter.
Hurley: i think he might be right. And i think it might be my fault.
Charlie: your fault?
Hurley: i'm kind of cursed. Death finds me, dude.
[suddenly vincent runs up carrying a mummified arm in his jaws. A key and rabbit's foot dangle from the hand. ]
charlie: vincent? Is that an arm?
Hurley: here, vincent. Come here. [to charlie] i think we need to get that.
Charlie: yeah, chase the dog with the skeletal arm into the creepy jungle. You be my guest.
Hurley: okay, if i'm not back in 3 hours tell somebody.
[hurley takes off running after vincent. ]
hurley: vincent! Vincent, come here. Vincent.
[hurley stops. Vincent shows up, drops the arm at his feet, and takes off again. Hurley grabs the key, and vincent barks getting hurley to follow. Hurley comes upon an old vw van turned on its side and overgrown with plants. ]
hurley: awesome.
Act 2
[flashback - hurley is being interviewed by a news crew outside a mr. Clucks. ]
tricia: it's everyone's fantasy -- winning the lottery -- untold millions falling into your lap overnight. What would you do with all that money? Well, one such lucky winner recently bought a chicken shack. I'm tricia tanaka with hugo reyes, winner of a record 140 million dollars, outside mr. Clucks chicken in diamond bar which will be having its grand re-opening tomorrow. So, hugo, i think the question on everyone's mind is: why did you buy mr. Clucks?
Hurley: [nervous] uh, i like chicken.
Tricia: um, also with us is hugo's former boss, and now employee, randy nation. That's probably every working stiff's fantasy, isn't it, mr. Reyes? [hurley just shrugs] um, okay, so, hugo, tell us what else you've done since you got on your lucky streak?
Hurley: actually, i've kind of had some bad luck, too. My grandpa tito died of a heart attack and the first house i bought my mom burnt down. My friend johnny ran off with my girlfriend, starla. Oh, and this guy jumped off my accountant's roof.
Tricia: cut! [to hurley] what the hell was that? ! It's a puff piece, mr. Reyes, do you know what that is?
Hurley: yeah. Sorry, tricia tanaka.
Tricia: um, do you mind if we go inside and shoot some b-roll?
Hurley: oh, i don't know.
Randy: yeah, yeah, yeah. Of course you can. He's just superstitious. You know, the ribbon isn't cut yet.
Tricia: [to cameraman] okay, let's go. Ugh, god i hate this. [voice fades] i always get the stupid stories...
Hurley: [to randy] hey, you sure it's okay?
Randy: yeah, relax.
Hurley: the safety guards are on the fryers?
Randy: those fryers are stone cold, alright? We don't even start cooking until tomorrow.
Hurley: do you hear something?
[we hear a sound like a missile in the background. Cut to tricia and cameraman inside. ]
tricia: and then pan through the...
[she stops when she hears the sound. Hurley and randy look up in disbelief as a meteor crashes into the restaurant. ]
[on-island - hurley examines the van and finds the body the arm belonged to. It's wearing a dharma jumpsuit with swan logo. Written under the logo is: roger; and on a second line: work man. ]
[paulo and others are at the beach "kitchen. "]
paulo: well, we are out of dharma oat bars.
Nikki: already?
Paulo: yep.
Nikki: did you check behind the powdered milk?
Paulo: yes, it's not there.
[camera pans to sun and jin at the table. ]
sun: will you pass me the box of cereal? [jin looks confused] will you pass me the box of cereal?
Jin:    .
Sun: from now on i will only speak to you in english. It's how you will learn.
Jin: ,  .
Sun: it will be hard at first.
Jin: [annoyed] ?
[hurley runs into camp and is quite winded. ]
hurley: hey! Hey! Hey everyone! Hey! !
Claire: hurley, what is it?
Paulo: is it the others?
Claire: hurley, are you okay?
Paulo: what's going on man?
Hurley: [triumphantly] car! I found a car tipped over in the jungle.
Nikki: you found a car?
Hurley: and we could totally fix it and get it going again. It's not far, come on.
Paulo: why do we need to start a car?
Hurley: because it'll be fun. [everyone looks sort of embarrassed for hurley] we could all use some fun. I mean, after everything's that happened we need it. [he looks at charlie] especially you, dude. So who's with me? ! !
Paulo: well, i've got to cut some bananas. Sorry.
Charlie: i don't think so, hurley.
Hurley: come on. Anyone. We're going to drive it! Who's coming? !
[everyone walks away except jin. Hurley walks over and puts a hand on his shoulder. ]
hurley: thanks, dude. [hurley laughs] you have no idea what you volunteered for, do you? [jin laughs] come on.
[kate and sawyer are walking in the jungle. ]
sawyer: are we there yet?
Kate: if we are where i think we are then our beach should be just through those trees. We'll be home in about 5 minutes.
Sawyer: try to contain your excitement, freckles.
Kate: forgive me if i'm not excited about explaining why there's only two of us coming back, james.
Sawyer: maybe they should explain why they ain't come looking for us. In fact, i'd be surprised if locke-- [sawyer steps on a dart] ow, ow, ow.
Kate: what happened?
Sawyer: i stepped on something. Son-of-a-bitch!
Kate: looks like a dart.
Sawyer: how the hell did it get out here?
Kate: alright, just relax your foot for a second, okay? I'm going to pull it out. On the count of 3. Ready? 1 -- [she pulls it out].
Sawyer: ow! ! ! I thought you said "3"?
Kate: yeah, well, anticipation's the worst part. I thought i would spare you. [she sits next to him and they share a long look] you know, all you have to do is say sorry. You could start again -- give each other a clean slate.
Sawyer: [sighing] slate. Like on little house?
Kate: what?
Sawyer: little house on the prairie? Laura ingalls used to write on this little chalkboard at school.
Kate: [laughing] you call it little house?
Sawyer: i had mono when i was a kid -- missed 2 months of school -- we only got one channel in my trailer.
Kate: what are we even talking about?
Sawyer: [quietly] we ain't talking about nothing. [he starts to exit]
kate: james?
Sawyer: and i ain't got nothing to be sorry for.
Kate: so that's how it's going to be? Welcome home, sawyer. [she walks off]
sawyer: welcome home, kate.
[scene switches to kate and sawyer arriving at the beach and everyone happily greeting them, even as they keep their distance from each other. ]
act 3
[flashback - we see hurley, still covered in dust from the mr. Clucks disaster. He enters a huge formal home as his mother, carmen, calls to him. ]
carmen: hugo! Hugo, is that you? Oh my god, what happened?
Hurley: tricia tanaka is dead.
Carmen: what?
Hurley: mr. Clucks got hit by a meteor, or an asteroid. I don't know the difference but it's gone.
Carmen: that's crazy.
Hurley: it's not crazy. It's the lottery money, the numbers, i'm cursed. And now tricia tanaka's dead, and her camera dude, and it's all my fault. [carmen slaps him hard across the face] ow! !
Carmen: it was an accident.
Hurley: it's not an accident. It is a curse. There's only one way to stop it. I have to go to australia.
Carmen: again with australia.
Hurley: that's where the numbers came from. Lenny, in the institution, he told me.
Carmen: hugo, hugo wait. I can prove to you you're not cursed.
Hurley: you can?
Carmen: yes. Come here with me. I have to show you something.
[she leads him away and we see his father, david, enter. ]
david: hey, hugo!
Carmen: after 17 years your father has returned.
David: [sizing hurley up] hey, your mom wasn't kidding about those candy bars. [he laughs] just kidding.
[on-island - hurley and jin look at roger in the van. ]
hurley: poor, roger. Sorry about your arm, dude.
Jin: [at the back of the van] hurley!  . In, in.
Hurley: totally. Let's check it out. [he opens the back of the van]
[inside there's a pile of dharma beer. ]
hurley: dude, roger was on a beer run.
Jin: [gesturing at the van]  .
Hurley: i suck at charades. You want to what?
Jin: [gesturing] , .
Hurley: oh, you want to take roger out? [jin continues gesturing] and turn it over. [yelling to jin] i understand!
[hurley and jin position themselves so they can take roger out of the van. ]
hurley: okay, on 3. 1-2-3.
[they pull him out, but his skull breaks off in the process. ]
hurley: we'll get that later.
[desmond is arranging his tarp. Charlie approaches. ]
charlie: so, when's it going to happen?
Desmond: when's what going to happen?
Charlie: don't play stupid with me, brother.
Desmond: i was drunk. Now if i said anything...
Charlie: i have a right to know when i'm going to die.
Desmond: it doesn't work like that.
Charlie: what doesn't work like that?
Sawyer: [entering] hey, oliver twist, where the hell's my stuff?
Charlie: what stuff?
Sawyer: oh, you know good and damn well what stuff! I had books, food, porno, a bottle of scotch.
Desmond: aye, apologies for the scotch, mate.
Sawyer: you drank it? !
Desmond: well, to be fair there was -- there was 3 of us.
Charlie: yeah, there was.
Sawyer: you, the munchkin, and who else?
[hurley and jin are in the jungle with long poles to use as levers to tip the van. ]
jin: [placing his pole under the van] , ? .
Hurley: oh, i got it. You're going to tip it up. Crafty.
Jin: crafty?
Hurley: yeah, crafty. It's like, when you're good at ... Crafts. Nevermind.
Sawyer: [entering] hey, where the hell's my stuff? [he notices the van] what are you all doing?
Hurley: [running to hug him] dude! You're alive! ! You're alive.
Sawyer: [chuckling] yeah, yeah, snuffy. Good to see you, too. I'll be damned, you all found yourselves a hippy car.
Hurley: pretty cool, huh?
Jin: [reaching for a hug] sawyer.
Sawyer: jin-bo. How are you going?
Jin: good see you.
Sawyer: well, look at that. Somebody's hooked on phonics.
Hurley: what about jack and kate? Are they with you? Are they alright?
Sawyer: kate's with me, but the doc -- they've still got him.
Hurley: okay. It's okay. It's going to be alright. Jack's going to be alright. We all are.
Sawyer: well, what a relief.
Hurley: naw, see, things are getting better. The car, you coming back safely -- it's a sign.
Sawyer: yeah, a sign i want my stuff back.
Hurley: uh-uh. You're going to help us fix this thing.
Sawyer: now why would i do that?
Hurley: because there's beer.
[locke, sayid and kate are walking on the beach. ]
sayid: why did he say "don't come back? "
kate: he sacrificed himself so we could escape. He probably didn't want it to be for nothing.
Sayid: hurley told us they released michael and walt.
Kate: yep. They gave michael a boat. He took off and never looked back.
Sayid: did you see any other boats?
Kate: no, but something tells me they didn't give away their only one.
Locke: so they can leave the island?
Kate: i don't know, john.
Sayid: this zoo where they held you, is that where they live?
Kate: [shaking her head] we escaped with one of them -- a kid named karl -- he says that they live on this island. He could have taken us there but sawyer let him go.
Sayid: why?
Kate: you're going to have to ask sawyer. [she starts to walk off]
sayid: kate, where are you going?
Kate: i don't care what jack said. They've got him and we've got to get him back. I owe him that. I'm going to get help.
Locke: help from who?
Act 4
[flashback - we see a close-up of a golden statuette of jesus. The camera pulls back to reveal the reyes family at the dinner table being served by two butlers. ]
david: now, that's a hell of a jesus.
Carmen: yes, hugo's such a good son. He knows of my love for the savior, so he commissioned artisans in taxco to custom carve for me this statue in solid gold.
David: ah, that smells like great lasagna.
Carmen: the tranhs made it themselves. Hugo found them in bennigans. Now they are our butlers.
[hurley is just sitting dejectedly, staring at his plate. ]
david: something wrong, hugo?
Carmen: your father asked you a question, hugo.
Hurley: my father? You're acting like he never left us -- like he hasn't been gone for 17 years. And all the sudden he shows up? Are you at least a little suspicious?
David: i showed up because your mom called and said you were in trouble.
Hurley: what? !
Carmen: all those numbers and curses. Hugo, i don't know what to do anymore. I thought you needed a manly influence, a father, to get you stop this nonsense.
Hurley: i'm not crazy. And the only reason he's back is because he wants the money.
David: well, now that hurts.
Hurley: well, guess what? There isn't going to be any money. Mr. Tranh? Lady tranh? Your services will no longer be needed. [he tosses a wad of money toward them] severance. Trust me, i'm doing you a huge favor. It's only a matter of time before the curse gets you, and you die, or worse.
Carmen: hugo, what are you doing?
Hurley: getting rid of it. All of it -- the money, the houses, the livestock -- and i'm starting with him.
Carmen: no, hugo. Your father is staying with us.
Hurley: he's staying with us? Where?
Carmen: it's been 17 years, hugo.
Hurley: what's been 17 years?
Carmen: i have needs.
Hurley: [covering his ears and yelling] no! No! No! This can't be happening. He has to go! He has to. I want him gone!
Carmen: no you don't.
Hurley: yeah, i do.
Carmen: why don't you go show your father what you have in the garage? Hugo?
[hurley and david in the garage with the old camaro. ]
david: i can't believe it. You saved it. You saved it.
[on-island - hurley, jin and sawyer tip the van up. Sawyer opens the side door, and vincent butts in. ]
sawyer: [to vincent] me first, now, come on.
[we see a shot of a large pile of crumpled papers. ]
sawyer: what the hell is up with all this recycling?
Hurley: you got me, dude.
[jin opens the engine compartment. Sawyer finds a map. ]
sawyer: looks like those dharma freaks were building some sort of dirt road. [he sees the beer] woo, now we're talking.
Jin: [looking at the engine overgrown with ivy]     ?
Hurley: looks good to me. Engine's fine, right?
Sawyer: [surprised] son-of-a -- what's a head doing back here?
Hurley: oh, that's just roger. [loudly to jin] i'm going to start the car now.
Jin: ,   .   .
Hurley: dude, even if you were speaking english, i wouldn't understand a word you were saying. Just relax; we're good. This'll work.
[sawyer grabs the beer out of the van, as hurley gets into the driver's seat. ]
hurley: i have hope. This will work.
[he closes his eyes and turns the key, but nothing happens. ]
hurley: [softly] damn it.
[sawyer opens a beer. Jin is working on the engine in the background with hurley standing over him. ]
sawyer: [smelling the beer] hoh, it's flat and it stinks.
Hurley: [to jin] can you get it to work? Do you know what's wrong?
Sawyer: chill out; let the man do his thing.
Hurley: dude, that beer's been sitting there since before rocky iii, maybe even ii. It's probably poison by now.
Sawyer: [pointing at roger] skeletor seems to like it. [sawyer clinks the beer can on roger's skull] bottoms up.
Hurley: that's not cool, dude. That guy had a mom, a family, and friends. Oh, and a name, it's not skeletor, it's roger workman.
Sawyer: it's work man, you blockhead. That's his job. He was a dharma janitor.
Hurley: yeah, well you should still respect the dead.
Jin:   . ...
Hurley: whoa, whoa, whoa, can you fix it?
Jin: no. No fix.
Hurley: but you have to! Can't you try, dude? I mean, we've got to get this thing running.
Sawyer: leave the man alone. He's right, "no fix. " take a look at that mess -- no way it's going to get running. How thick are you?
Hurley: what's your problem, man? Why don't you want this to work?
Sawyer: i don't care if it works. Why is it so important to you?
Hurley: because we could all use a little hope.
Sawyer: if it's hope you're looking for ese, you're on the wrong damn island. There sure as hell ain't no hope here.
Act 5
[flashback - we see hurley in bed asleep and david enters to wake him up. ]
david: rise and shine; hit the deck. We're burning daylight; let's go. [hurley moans grumpily] what's with the earphones?
Hurley: it's for the noise.
David: well, your mother's a very passionate woman.
Hurley: that is disgusting.
David: come on, we're going on an adventure. Let's go.
Hurley: i'm not going anywhere with you.
David: come on, just do this one thing with me. If it doesn't work, you can go to australia. I won't stop you, okay?
Hurley: what "one thing? "
david: we're going to break the curse.
[scene switches to david and hurley in a psychic, lynn karnoff's, office. ]
hurley: this is stupid.
David: just give it a chance, man.
Lynn: [setting a tarot deck on the table] cut the deck please. [flipping the first card] you've recently come into a great deal of money.
Hurley: you could have seen that on the news.
Lynn: [flipping second card] but it hasn't brought you happiness. No, it's brought you great misfortune.
David: she didn't see that on the news.
Lynn: i'm seeing numbers.
Hurley: what numbers?
Lynn: 4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42. There's darkness around these numbers. Great tragedy. [she flips the third card, death] i'm sorry.
Hurley: why? What is it?
Lynn: death surrounds you; and more is coming. Your hands, please. There's a curse on you. But it can be removed. [she starts toward another room] now, hugo, i need you to remove your clothes.
Hurley: my clothes?
Lynn: [carrying a large pot, begins dumping in spices, cracking eggs, etc. ] a curse is like an unwelcome entity that lives inside you. And it must be exorcised.
Hurley: did my dad put you up to this?
Lynn: what?
David: hugo, please.
Hurley: i'll give you a thousand dollars right now if you admit that my dad told you to say this stuff.
Lynn: the mystic arts are not subject to bribes. How dare you!
Hurley: 10,000.
Lynn: your dad put me up to it.
David: i was just trying to help.
Hurley: help who?
[on-island - we see hurley praying as jin and sawyer talk. ]
sawyer: beer.
Jin: beer.
Sawyer: bingo. Beautiful. [tapping the van] car.
Jin: car.
Sawyer: [pointing to hurley] international house of pancakes. [to hurley] what are you doing over there?
Hurley: i'm praying.
Sawyer: praying for what?
Hurley: help.
Sawyer: well, hell, i've got you a little help right here.
[sawyer tosses a can of beer in hurley's direction and hurley watches it roll down a hill. He suddenly gets an idea and leaves. ]
[hurley approaches charlie at the beach. ]
hurley: dude. Hey, dude, stop moping. Come on.
Charlie: not moping -- thinking.
Hurley: uh-uh. When people stare out at the ocean and get all quiet-like? They're moping. So get up and come with me. That car i found? We're getting it running.
Charlie: what's the point? [hurley slaps charlie across the face] ow! What did you do that for?
Hurley: snap out of it! Stop feeling sorry for yourself because someone said you're going to die. I've got an idea that's going to help us both. [pulling him to his feet] now, it is dangerous. And there's a very good chance that you will die.
Charlie: that's supposed to convince me to come with you?
Hurley: it is. Because if you don't die, then we win.
Charlie: win?
Hurley: look, i don't know about you, but things have really sucked for me lately and i could use a victory. So let's get one, dude. Let's get this car started. Let's look death in the face and say, "whatever, man. " let's make our own luck. What do you say?
[sawyer and jin at the van in the jungle. ]
sawyer: i'm sorry.
Jin: i'm sorry.
Sawyer: okay, nice. Keep it coming.
Jin: you were right.
Sawyer: okay. That's two. Hit me.
Jin: those pants don't make you look fat.
Sawyer: now you got it -- only three things a woman needs to hear.
Hurley: [entering] come on. Get up; we've got work to do.
Sawyer: what's your problem, jumbotron.
Hurley: shut up! Red -- neck -- man.
Sawyer: touche. [charlie enters] what is jiminy cricket doing here?
Hurley: we need another man.
Sawyer: another man for what?
Hurley: to push this car, dude.
Sawyer: push it? Push it where?
[hurley walks over to sawyer and pulls him up. ]
[they push the van to the edge of a fairly steep hill. ]
sawyer: oh, this is going to be real good.
Act 6
[flashback - we see hurley packing as david enters. ]
david: so, you're going to australia, huh? [hurley doesn't respond] long way to go because of some stupid numbers.
Hurley: i'd really like you to leave.
David: when your mom called me about the lottery i was on my bike before she could hang the phone up. I'm getting old. Yeah, i saw my retirement. You're right. I'm here for the money.
Hurley: well, you're not getting any of it.
David: that's not why i'm here talking to you now. I'm here talking to you now because going to australia's not going to break any curse. You don't need to leave. You just -- you need a little hope. We make our own luck, hugo. You know what i think you should do?
Hurley: what?
David: i think you should give away the money. All of it, every penny. Just save enough for a new carburetor -- work on the camaro -- you know, just you and me -- take it off the blocks and make that road trip to the grand canyon. Never too late for a fresh start.
Hurley: i'll send you a postcard from sydney. [he starts to exit]
david: hey, i'll -- i'll be here when you get back.
[on-island - we see a shot down into a valley. ]
sawyer: are you nuts? You're not going to drive down that.
Hurley: we're going to jumpstart it. You guys are going to push it. And then on the way down i'm going to pop the clutch and get it started.
Sawyer: you see those rocks? All you're going to do is crash into those real fast. If you don't roll over first.
Jin: hurley, no.
Hurley: dudes, i know how to drive. Now come on, just push me. This'll work; i know it.
Sawyer: [to charlie] what are you out here for -- watch him crash and burn?
Charlie: came to ride shotgun.
Sawyer: well, it's your funeral. [to jin] come on, let's give 'em their ride.
Hurley: [to charlie] are you sure you want to do this?
Charlie: victory or death.
Hurley: push!
[they push the van down the slope and it bounces along picking up speed. ]
hurley: oh, jeez.
Charlie: careful now. [they get closer to the boulders] now would be a good time, hurley. Like right now!
Hurley: there is no curse. You make your own luck.
Charlie: hurley!
Hurley: you make your own luck. There is no curse!
[he pops the clutch and the car starts. An old 8 track starts playing "shambala" by three dog night, as charlie and hurley laugh and whoop. ]
sawyer: son-of-a-bitch.
Jin: [raises his arms in the air] hurley!
[sawyer, jin and vincent run down to meet them, and they all have a joy ride. ]
[fade to a montage of jin, charlie and sawyer returning to the beach. Jin gives sun a white flower. Charlie talks to claire. Sawyer carries the beer and wants to bring it to the "kitchen" and share, but can't bring himself to do it. Hurley sits contentedly in the van. Sawyer has a beer alone at his tent while wistfully watching the couples (sun and jin, charlie and claire). ]
[we see kate at night hiking with a torch. She finds some netting. Sayid and locke enter. ]
sayid: kate, if you were looking for help to find jack why didn't you ask us?
Kate: two reasons -- you don't know where to look and you're not motivated. And i don't blame you. Why would you want to go on another trek across the island, risk more lives just to get jack back?
Locke: you're wrong.
Kate: oh, really? Then why didn't you come after--
locke: not about the motivation, just about knowing where to look. We got a compass bearing, and i'm pretty sure if we follow it it'll lead us right to him.
Kate: how?
Sayid: [with some sarcasm] because of the way the sunlight hit mr. Eko's stick when john was burying him.
Locke: so now you know our secret, how about you tell us yours?
[suddenly there is gunfire, and locke pulls his gun. ]
kate: no, no, no, don't shoot. Don't shoot. [calling out] it's alright! It's safe! We're just here to talk! You can come out!
[danielle enters cautiously. ]
danielle: what are you doing here?
Kate: i came to ask for your help.
Danielle: to do what?
Kate: i'm heading to the other's camp, and if i'm going to find it, i need someone who knows the island.
Danielle: what makes you think i have an interest in helping you?
Kate: because they had me, and they would have never let me go -- probably would have killed me if i hadn't escaped. And the girl who helped me escape -- she was about 16 years old and her name was alex. I'm pretty sure that she's your daughter.
Act 1
[nikki runs frantically through the jungle. She grabs something out of her bag, and buries it in the dirt quickly, before getting up shakily to resume running. ]
[flashback - nikki steps down the stairs in a strip club, wearing a white jacket and hat. ]
announcer: and now, dancing on stage three, the pride of saint paul, corvette!
[nikki pole dances, stripping off her jacket. She notices a man in a suit enter a back room. She follows him into the room, entering to find the man opening a case full of money, and another man in a purple hat facing cctv feeds. ]
nikki: no! That's the money for the orphanage. That means, mr. Lashade, you're the cobra.
Billy dee: sorry, baby, it's just business.
Nikki: all this time it was you.
Billy dee: pretty and smart. What a shame.
[he looks to the other man, who attacks nikki. She kicks the gun out of his hand and karate chops him in the neck. ]
nikki: razzle-dazzle! Ha!
[she bends down and grabs the gun, but "lashade" pulls out another gun and shoots her three times. She collapses. He gets up and shoots her again. Two other strippers enter and see nikki's body. ]
billy dee: autumn, crystal, bad news. Corvette was working for the cobra. But fear not: he will pay.
Zukerman: and, cut!
[a man with a clipboard signals the scene's end. Production crew rush around. Nikki lifts herself up. ]
billy dee: oh, let me give you a hand. [helps nikki up]
nikki: oh, thank you. Billy dee, it was so great working with you.
Billy dee: oh, no, the pleasure's all mine; thank you so much.
Nikki: you're sweet.
Billy dee: take care.
Nikki: you too.
[nikki heads over to meet the director, howard l. Zukerman. ]
zukerman: alright, that's a series wrap for corvette! Let's hear it for nikki!
[most of the production crew clap and whistle. ]
nikki: thank you.
Zukerman: brilliant, nikki. As always. You know, you don't need to die. We can bring you back next season.
Nikki: [laughs] how?
Zukerman: well, let's say that, uh, corvette was wearing a bullet-proof vest?
[nikki pulls away her jacket to remind zukerman that she is wearing nothing but a bikini underneath. ]
zukerman: bullet-proof breast!
Nikki: [covering back up] look, i'm just a guest star, and we all know what happens to guest stars.
Zukerman: now that your work's done here, i suppose you'll be leaving sydney and heading back to la.
[they step off-set to look at sydney harbour. ]
nikki: no, i'm not leaving sydney. I love you.
Zukerman: i love you too.
[they smile and kiss. ]
[present - hurley and sawyer are playing table tennis. Hurley wins the point. ]
sawyer: son of a bitch! Alright, come on, let's go one more.
Hurley: you said best out of five.
Sawyer: well, now we're going best of seven.
[suddenly someone approaches from the jungle. It's nikki, who stumbles onto the beach looking dazed. ]
sawyer: ah.
Hurley: uh, you ok?
[nikki falls to the ground, struggling to breathe. Hurley rushes over, and sawyer follows. ]
hurley: what happened?
Nikki: [struggling for breath] pa... Lies...
Sawyer: the hell's she saying? !
Hurley: i dunno.
Sawyer: let's get her some water! Get help!
[sawyer gets up and moves toward the jungle, peering through the trees to see where nikki came from. As hurley watches, nikki stops moving. Sawyer turns around and sees hurley sitting there. ]
sawyer: what are you doing? ! Get moving!
Hurley: dude... Nikki's dead.
Sawyer: ... Who the hell's nikki?
Act 2
[flashback - 84 days ago, nikki sits in zukerman's house eating breakfast with him. ]
nikki: mmm. Howie, the frittata is amazing.
Zukerman: hm hm! My new chef; he's fantastic. Paulo, come in here.
Paulo: [walking in with a bread basket] yes, sir?
Zukerman: paulo, my boy, you have a new fan. I'd like you to meet nikki.
Nikki: the food is amazing.
Paulo: you're too kind. The secret is the shaved truffles. Luckily for you, they are in season.
Nikki: [in a mock whisper] you know, you should ask for a raise.
[paulo chuckles, and nikki bursts into laughter. ]
paulo: excuse me. [walks away]
zukerman: he just came to sydney. Heard i was hiring, and showed up at my office every day until i gave him the job. Apparently, back home, he's the, um, "wolfgang puck of brazil".
Nikki: wow.
Zukerman: [grabs the bread basket] here. Try one of these home-made rolls. [nikki laughs] please, please do.
[nikki takes a slice, revealing a diamond bracelet underneath. ]
nikki: oh, it's... Beautiful. Howie, you shouldn't have!
Zukerman: [laughs as nikki puts the bracelet on] i realize, of course, it's not a ring. Not yet. But, uh, when my wife--
[nikki looks up from admiring the bracelet as zukerman abruptly stops. Zukerman suddenly starts to choke and grab his chest. ]
nikki: [standing up, urgently] paulo.. ! Paulo!
[paulo hurries in. Both stand over zukerman as he moans, then stops moving. Paulo checks his pulse. ]
paulo: he's gone.
[nikki moves to touch him softly, but instead pulls open his shirt and grabs a key on a necklace he's wearing. She snaps the necklace off of zukerman. ]
nikki: [scornfully] i would have loved it if you could have figured out a way where i didn't have to eat the same food as him.
[they move to a walk-in closet and find a safe. ]
paulo: so nobody else knows about this thing?
Nikki: everything in here is way off the books.
[nikki puts the key in the safe and starts to open it. Paulo pulls out a cigarette and prepares to light up, but nikki grabs it out of his mouth. ]
paulo: what?
Nikki: ashes are evidence, paulo. We poisoned him; let's not poison ourselves.
[paulo reluctantly snaps his lighter shut. Nikki opens the safe and pulls out a matryoshka doll. She opens three layers of dolls to get to the core. Nikki and paulo smile down at it. ]
nikki: razzle-frickin'-dazzle.
[present - nikki's body is lying on the beach, as the survivors assess the situation. ]
charlie: what happened?
Hurley: we dunno. She's got no gunshot wound, no knife wound, no polar bear bite, nothing.
Sun: maybe it was something she ate.
Charlie: maybe she was poisoned.
Sun: we should check the food supply to see if anyone else is sick.
Charlie: [checking nikki's limp hands] she's got gunk. Under her fingernails. [to sawyer] where'd you find her?
Sawyer: right here. She stumbled out of the jungle, face-planted, said something like "plywood", and... And, sayonara.
Hurley: actually, i think she said "power lines. "
sawyer: well, who the hell knows what she said  she was five seconds from dying. Probably seeing a light at the end of the tunnel
hurley: [interrupts sawyer with a shout] "paulo lies! " that's what she said! "paulo lies, " not "power lines. " "paulo lies. "
sawyer: who the hell's paulo?
Hurley: paulo's her... Husband, or... Boyfriend, or... Whatever. They lived down the beach.
Sawyer: well, where the hell is he? 'cause if he lies, that might be a good place to start.
[flashback - 80 days ago. Paulo looks at a newspaper article on howey's death as he and nikki sit in sydney airport. ]
paulo: english ex-pat, howard l. Zuckerman, the creative force behind such hit shows as expose, strike team alpha and dr. Kincaid esquire, was found dead in his palatial sydney estate from heart failure.
[both laugh, and paulo kisses nikki. ]
nikki: are you chewing gum?
[paulo opens his bag, inside is the matryoshka doll. He pulls out a pack of nicotine gum. ]
paulo: nicotine gum. I quit.
[they pick up champagne glasses. ]
paulo: a toast. To our new life together.
Nikki: cheers.
[behind them, two people arrive. ]
shannon: there's nowhere to sit. No tables, no chairs, nothing. Good call, boone.
Boone: do you wanna just grab a chair from the restaurant?
Shannon: no, forget it, let's just leave. You already screwed us out of seats in first class, why would you be able to find them here?
Boone: [to paulo and nikki] hey, can i have this chair please?
Paulo: yeah. Be my guest.
Shannon: boone, let's just go!
Boone: thanks anyway.
[they both walk away. ]
shannon: boone!
Boone: i'm coming, shannon.
Shannon: if you quit flirting with random guys, maybe you could actually get on the plane.
Nikki: promise me we'll never end up like them.
Paulo: i promise.
[they kiss again]
airport pa: paging captain stewart, please pick up the courtesy call captain stewart.
[the scene moves to the beach, but still in flashback. It's the moments following the crash. Shannon screams at the top of her lungs. Jin shouts for sun, as nikki appears in the background]
shannon: boone! ! ! Boone! ! ! Boone! ! !
[nikki rushes past, seeing jack with claire, boone with rose. She then sees locke helping carry a man. Locke turns to another man near the turbine]
locke: hey, hey, get away from there! [to nikki] hey, get back, get down. Get away from there! ! !
[the man is pulled into the turbine, causing it to explode. Nikki carries on walking, and sees a man lying face down]
nikki: paulo! Paulo!
[she turns him over, to find it is not paulo. It's leslie arzt. ]
arzt: are we alive? Did we survive? Look at me, am i ok? Am i ok?
Boone: [runs up to nikki] hey. Do you have a pen? Do you have a pen? [runs off] hey does anybody have a pen? !
[nikki finally sees paulo looking out at sea with shocked eyes]
nikki: paulo. Paulo, are you ok?
Paulo: yeah. I think so.
Nikki: baby look at me. Look at me.
[paulo does so. ]
nikki: where's the bag?
Paulo: what?
Nikki: the bag, paulo, where is it?
[paulo looks shocked. ]
[present - sawyer, hurley and jin can be heard approaching paulo's body in the jungle. ]
sawyer: i'm telling ya, this is the trail.
Hurley: what do you know about tracking?
Sawyer: well i know what a footprint is.
Jin: over here.
[they find his body]
hurley: wow.
Sawyer: i'm guessing that's paulo.
Act 3
hurley: he's just like nikki, no wound, nothing.
Jin:     ?
Hurley: yeah i know.
[sawyer sees one of paulo's shoes stuck in a tree]
hurley: why are his pants undone? And why's his shoe in that tree?
Sawyer: maybe he stepped on something.
[sawyer looks out into the jungle as jin opens paulo's bag]
hurley: you see something? Sawyer?
Sawyer: nothing.
[jin uncaps paulo's bottle of water]
sawyer: no! Don't.
[he pours all the liquid out]
hurley: dude, what are you doing?
Sawyer: two people are dead  you ever think they mighta been poisoned?
Hurley: that's evidence. You're messing up the crime scene.
Sawyer: crime scene? There a forensics hatch i don't know about?
Jin: stop! Monster.
[flashback - 75 days ago. At night, nikki and paulo look through some of the unclaimed luggage. ]
nikki: how many times do i have to tell you, there's no such thing as monsters.
Paulo: maybe it was a dinosaur.
Nikki: its not jurassic park, paulo, its the south pacific.
Paulo: then what was it? You saw the trees move.
Nikki: would you start focusing? We've been here for six days, ok, the coastguard is gonna get here any second, and i really don't think that they're gonna take "hey, you know what, i'm looking for my script bag" as an excuse for not getting on the rescue boat.
Paulo: ok, ok, ok.
Ethan: hey. You guys lose your luggage? Yeah i lost mine too. I found some other stuff though, so if you need anything, pants or sweatshirt, i can help you find some that fit. I'm ethan, by the way.
Nikki: hi, i'm nikki, and this is paulo.
Ethan: nikki.
Paulo: hi.
Ethan: paulo.
Nikki: and you are so sweet ethan, but actually we're not looking for clothes. Yeah, see, paulo here lost his nicotine gum.
Ethan: ouch. You might have more luck looking inland.
Paulo: in the jungle?
Ethan: the plane split apart when it was over the island [possibly says islands], so some of the stuff might have rained down in there.
[commotion can be heard, and arzt runs past. ]
arzt: boone. Boone took the water.
[many survivors chatter. ]
kate: what is going on?
Boone: someone had to take responsibility for it, it would have never lasted!
[the group start to fight, sayid holds back charlie. ]
jack: leave him alone! Its been six days, we're all still waiting for someone to come. We have to stop waiting. We need to start figuring things out. Now i found water. Fresh water up in the valley. I'll take in a group at first light. If you don't wanna come, then find another way to contribute. Because every man for himself is not gonna work. But if we can't live together, we're gonna die alone.
[present - the group have brought paulo's body back to the beach to keep it with nikki. ]
hurley: i'm with jin. It's the monster.
Sawyer: yeah, because that makes the most sense.
Hurley: it does. Locke said when eko died, his last words were "you're next. " and nikki and paulo were with them. He was talking about them.
Sawyer: he wasn't saying you're next about them, he was saying you're next as in you're all next.
Hurley: yeah, that's not really better.
Sawyer: alright, so here's how i see it. We wanna know what happened, we gotta find out whatever we can about these jabronis.
Jin: jabronis?
Sawyer: nina and pablo.
Hurley: dude, show some respect. You know their names, its nikki and paulo.
Sawyer: whatever, hugo. Where's their tent? And we better get some shovels.
[flashback - 57 days ago. Nikki wanders the beach and goes to arzt's tent, where he is examing bottles with insects inside them. ]
nikki: hey dr. Arzt.
Arzt: oh hi.
Nikki: you're a scientist, right?
Arzt: and an educator, yes.
Nikki: what are you doing with all this stuff?
Arzt: oh, erm well, since we've been on here, i've discovered 20 new species. I'm gonna be the next charles darwin.
[nikki picks up a glass. ]
arzt: ah, ah, that is a latrodectus regina. Very dangerous. They call her the medusa spider. Her pheromones are very strong, one whiff and every male of the species would be here in seconds. Not unlike you i guess.
Nikki: so, you're probably too busy to help me then.
Arzt: no, no, not at all, i'm fine, er, i can help you, what can i do ya for?
Nikki: well i'm trying to find my luggage, and since the plane broke apart over the jungle, i was wondering if you knew about trajectories and stuff.
Arzt: [laughs] do i, do i know about trajectories? Allow me to draw you a map, madam.
[nikki looks to see paulo watching her. ]
[later, they trek through the jungle together carrying the map. ]
paulo: are you sure we should be listening to a high school science teacher?
Nikki: junior high, and yes. What's your problem with leslie anyway?
Paulo: leslie?
Nikki: oh ho, you're jealous!
Paulo: of him? Ha, never.
Nikki: yeah, his spiders turn me on so much, i had to sleep with him to get the map.
Paulo: i wouldn't be surprised. You slept with zuckerman.
[nikki stops walking. ]
nikki: i did that for us.
[she continues walking. ]
paulo: ok i'm sorry, i just, i don't trust that guy. We should have gone to ethan, he would have helped.
Nikki: paulo, look.
[they both look up to see the smugglers' plane dangling over the cliff edge, caught in the vines. ]
paulo: another plane. Looks like its been here a while.
Nikki: go up there, maybe there's a radio or some
paulo: are you insane? If i go up there that thing's gonna fall.
Nikki: you're not gonna fall.
Paulo: what? You want me to die? [pause] come on. Let's keep going.
[they carry on, walking over soil. ]
nikki: what's that?
[paulo looks to see hatch doors poorly covered in dirt. They uncover it and try the doors. ]
paulo: ok, let's do it.
[they pull the doors open to reveal a deep drop and a ladder by the side. ]
paulo: let's check it out.
Nikki: wow. So our carry-on bag fell from the sky, opened a manhole, crawled inside and closed the doors behind itself? You don't wanna climb up to a plane, but now you wanna climb down a ladder into a dark tunnel. I don't think so.
[nikki shuts one of the doors and walks off]
[present - sawyer rummages through nikki and paulo's tent as hurley watches. ]
hurley: hey, man, be careful.
Sawyer: why? They don't live here any more.
Charlie: so sun checked the food. They were eating the same as us and no one else is sick. Could it be a virus?
Hurley: dude, monster. [looks over] creepy, they collected bugs.
Charlie: ah, i think these were arzt's. Collected all kinds of creepy crawlies before he... Exploded.
Hurley: they must have been friends.
[charlie pulls out a script-book]
charlie: expose.
Hurley: did you just say expose?
Charlie: yeah.
Sawyer: what the hell's expose?
Hurley: only the most awesome hour of television ever. It's like "baywatch", only better. Its about autumn and crystal, two strippers that solve crimes with the help of their suave smooth-talking club owner, mr. Lashade.
Sawyer: how'd i miss that one?
Hurley: check it out, look at the cast list, nikki fernandez. That's gotta be why she was in australia. This must have been her big break.
Charlie: well it certainly sounds like it.
Hurley: no way. Mr. Lashade was the cobra?
Charlie: is that supposed to mean something?
Hurley: dude the cobra's this big bad guy. His identity's been shrouded in mystery for four seasons.
[sawyer finds a walkie in paulo's luggage, and turns it on. ]
hurley: they had a walkie talkie?
Sawyer: every damn one of those bastards on the other side of the island had one exactly like this hanging from their belts.
Charlie: so how did nikki and paulo get one?
Sawyer: i'll tell ya how. They were working with the others.
Act 4
[flashback - 48 days ago. Shannon and arzt stand arguing with kate as paulo and nikki approach]
shannon: what gives you the right?
Kate: you have to understand, we thought it was best for everybody.
Arzt: i'm sorry, you my mother? Cause she knows what's best for me  other than that, i decide.
[nikki and paulo walk over. ]
nikki: hey, what's going on?
Shannon: kate and her two boyfriends found a case of guns that fell out of the plane, but they decided they didn't really need to tell the camp.
Kate: look. The case is locked. The key is around jack's neck, alright. I promise you they're safe.
Arzt: you're all out of control. The pigs are walking. [shouts] huh, the pigs are walking!
[both shannon and arzt leave. ]
nikki: [to kate] so, where did you say you found that case?
[at the waterfall, nikki and paulo stand discussing. ]
nikki: its just water, paulo. Stop being such a wuss and dive in.
Paulo: why me?
Nikki: well as you had no trouble reminding me, i slept with howie zuckerman. So the least you could do is go for a swim, and kate said they found the case on the bottom.
Paulo: lemme ask you something.
Nikki: what?
Paulo: if you didn't need me to find that bag, would we still be together?
Nikki: that bag is worth eight million dollars. Just dive in, paulo.
[paulo does so, and finds the bag between some rocks. He resurfaces. ]
nikki: well?
Paulo: nothing.
Nikki: there's nothing down there?
Paulo: just dead bodies.
[nikki leaves, and paulo goes underwater once more. ]
[present - the survivors stand over nikki and paulo's bodies. ]
hurley: ok, so they had a walkie talkie. You think they were working with the others, like how?
Sawyer: like michael.
Charlie: if that's the case, then why'd they kill nikki and paulo?
Sawyer: who knows why those people do anything? What matters is they could be out there right now waiting to get us.
Hurley: i dunno, dude. I was with the others, like, two weeks ago, they're on a total other side of the island.
Sun: then who dragged me into the jungle? [charlie and sawyer glance at each other. ] the others came into our camp, they grabbed me, put a bag over my head. And if i hadn't gotten away, they would have killed me.
Sawyer: look, y'all stay here. [pulls out a gun] lemme see if i can see any sign of 'em. I'll do a perimeter sweep.
Hurley: where'd you get the gun?
Sawyer: got it off one of them.
Hurley: and when were you gonna let us know?
Sawyer: i guess right now.
[sawyer leaves. ]
hurley: what exactly is a perimeter sweep?
Charlie: [shakes his head] hey, shouldn't we cover them up?
Sun: yes, of course.
[flashback - 32 days ago. At night, paulo is on the beach digging through his carry-on bag that he found in the waterfall earlier. He opens and chews some nicotine gum before beginning to bury the matryoshka doll in the sand. ]
locke: nice night.
[paulo is caught by surprise and hides the doll. ]
locke: what you doing?
Paulo: nothing.
Locke: it looks like you're digging a hole. Every man's entitled to his secrets paulo, but can i give ya a piece of advice?
Paulo: please, john.
Locke: you should put the shovel away and save yourself some trouble.
Paulo: why is that?
Locke: things don't stay buried on this island. The beach is eroding. Winter's coming, high tide. Whatever it is you're hiding, make sure you pick a spot that won't wash away. See you back at camp.
[paulo looks at the doll, thinking. ]
[some time later, paulo enters the pearl station with a flashlight and investigates. He finds a toilet, and hides the matryoshka doll in the plumbing behind it. Before he can leave, he hears voices and hides. ]
ben: who left this open?
Juliet: tom was down here a couple of days ago.
Ben: have him cover it up with the plane.
[ben and juliet enter the main room and turn on one of the monitors, revealing the swan station with jack in the shot. ]
juliet: that him? Shephard?
Ben: yes.
Juliet: he's cute. Why are we doing this? Shephard will never agree to do the surgery.
Ben: no, i can convince him to do it.
Juliet: how?
Ben: same way i get anybody to do anything. I find out what he's emotionally invested in, and i exploit it.
Juliet: so, what? We just grab all three of them, ford and austen too?
Ben: no, they need to come to us.
Juliet: and how do we make that happen?
Ben: michael, of course.
Juliet: are we done here? This place gives me the creeps.
[ben turns off the monitor and they leave, shutting off the lights too. Paulo creeps out of his hiding place, and finds a walkie on the table. ]
[present - hurley rushes over to the food tent. ]
hurley: hey! Desmond! You hear about what happened to nikki and paulo?
Desmond: aye. Tragic.
Hurley: so, do you know anything?
Desmond: how do you mean?
Hurley: can you, you know, use your psychic powers?
Desmond: doesn't work like that. I only see flashes.
Hurley: no offense dude, but as far as superpowers go, yours is kinda lame. Thanks anyway.
Desmond: i do know that she was with your mate this morning.
Hurley: my mate?
Desmond: i saw her with your boy sawyer. The dead girl, nikki.
Hurley: he said he didn't know her.
Desmond: then why was she yelling at him?
Hurley: yelling?
Desmond: aye.
Hurley: at sawyer, this morning?
Desmond: right before she died.
Act 5
[further down the beach, where paulo and nikki bodies are lying, vincent pulls away the blankets covering them. ]
hurley: vincent! Dude!
Charlie: so he saw sawyer and nikki fighting. That doesn't prove anything.
Hurley: look at the facts, and ask yourself. Why is sawyer so gung-ho about investigating this? What's in it for him? He pretended he didn't know their names, but then he was fighting with nikki.
Sun: sawyer's not a murderer. He went all the way across the island to help michael. It is the others, i know what they can do.
Hurley: ok, you know what, i'll go get desmond. He'll tell you exactly what he saw.
[hurley leaves. ]
charlie: sun. It was me.
Sun: what?
Charlie: it was me who took you, not the others. I wasn't myself. After locke hit me. After he humiliated me. Sawyer told me i could get even by helping him steal the guns, we just made it look like, the others. I didn't mean to hurt you.
[sun walks away with a tear in her eye. ]
charlie: [mutters] sorry.
[flashback - 9 days ago. Locke, sayid and desmond approach a group of survivors, including nikki and paulo]
locke: hey everybody. We're heading out to the pearl station, there's a computer there that might help us find our people. Anybody wanna come along?
Nikki: [raises her hand] i'll go.
Locke: great.
Paulo: what?
Locke: anybody else wanna come, meet us at the tree line in 10 minutes, and bring water.
Paulo: you're not serious.
Nikki: what? You always whine about not being included. Now's our chance.
[inside the pearl, the group try to fix the monitors. Meanwhile, paulo sneaks into the side room to retrieve the doll. ]
nikki: hey guys. What are these other tvs for?
Locke: sorry?
Nikki: all these tvs. This guy says that there's six stations, [inaudible]
[the pearl orientation video is replayed with nikki pointing out the pluralized form projects. " paulo retrieves the bag of diamonds and flushes the toilet before entering the main room. The rest of them turn from the sound of the toilet. ]
paulo: the toilet still works.
[the group shrugs off the interruption. ]
[present - the survivors are busy digging nikki and paulo's graves. Sawyer approaches. ]
hurley: give me the gun.
Sawyer: the hell you talking about?
Hurley: give it to me.
[sawyer pulls out the clip. ]
sawyer: ain't even loaded.
Hurley: then how are you sweeping the perimeter? Quit lying dude. Desmond saw you fighting with nikki this morning.
Sawyer: oh i see what this is. Villagers have got themselves some torches.
Hurley: did you kill them?
Sawyer: no. No, i didn't kill them. Yeah, me and nikki went at it this morning. Cause she wanted a gun.
Hurley: why didn't you tell us this before?
Sawyer: cause of the dirt under her nails.
Hurley: what?
Sawyer: she was digging. And when we found him i saw a fresh mound of dirt. She was burying something. And if you take the time to dig a hole right before you die, then what you're hiding's probably pretty damn good.
Sun: so what was it? What did she hide?
[sawyer throws sun a pouch. She sprinkles out the contents onto her hands. Diamonds. ]
sawyer: go ahead, take 'em. Cause whatever happened to those two, i had nothing to do with it.
[sawyer walks away. ]
act 6
[flashback - 12 hours ago. Nikki sits on the beach, and paulo joins her. ]
nikki: did you know thanksgiving was two weeks ago?
[paulo shakes his head. ]
nikki: we missed it, paulo, just like we're gonna miss everything.
Paulo: they're going to find us. We'll get rescued. You'll see.
Nikki: [laughs] ok, where did this sudden burst of optimism come from?
Paulo: i dunno, i guess, it's how we look at things. Like the bag. I mean, maybe not finding it was good for us.
Nikki: how do you figure that?
Paulo: look what it did. It might have torn us apart.
Nikki: yeah.
[they both smile. ]
paulo: wait here. I'm gonna get us some breakfast.
Nikki: [smiles] ok.
[they kiss briefly. As paulo leaves, nikki notices something on the sand. Nicotine gum, which was in the same bag as the doll. ]
[nikki goes to see sawyer. ]
nikki: ok, i know you have them. Give me a gun.
Sawyer: i don't have the guns. A-team took 'em all.
Nikki: right, except for the ones you kept for yourself.
Sawyer: even if i had a gun i wouldn't give it to you. Judging by the fire you're breathing, i got a feeling no good would come of it.
Nikki: sawyer, give me a gun.
[across the beach, desmond notices the two arguing. ]
sawyer: i got a better idea, sister. How about you go stick your head in the ocean and cool yourself off?
Nikki: thanks for nothing.
[she leaves. Sawyer shouts after her. ]
sawyer: and who the hell are you? !
[present - sawyer goes over to nikki's body. ]
sawyer: [whispers] thanks for nothing.
[he closes her eyes and begins to dig. Sun approaches him. ]
sun: charlie told me it was your idea. To kidnap me.
Sawyer: [sighs] you gonna tell jin?
Sun: no.
Sawyer: why not?
Sun: because then we'd have to dig another grave.
[sun takes sawyer's hand and gives him back the diamonds. ]
sawyer: why are you giving me these?
Sun: because they're worthless here.
Sawyer: see, and i thought i was going to get out of this without a
[sun slaps sawyer hard across the face and walks away. ]
[some time later, nikki and paulo's bodies have been placed in the grave. A group of survivors have gathered for their funeral. ]
hurley: nikki and paulo. I guess we didn't really know you very well. And it appears, you killed each other for diamonds. But i know there are good parts to you too. You were always nice to me. And you're a member of the camp. And... I really loved expose. Ok then, goodbye
sawyer: wait.
[he pours the diamonds into his hands, and throws them over the bodies]
sawyer: rest in peace, nikki and paulo.
[flashback - 8 hours ago. Nikki leads paulo through the jungle. ]
paulo: come on. You can just tell me.
Nikki: na-uh, it's a surprise. We're almost there. Ok, ready?
Paulo: yeah.
Nikki: i found the diamonds, paulo.
Paulo: [a shot of confusion goes across his face] what? Where?
Nikki: right here.
[paulo looks on the ground as nikki frowns. ]
nikki: give 'em to me.
Paulo: what're you talking about?
Nikki: what am i talking about? [pulls out the gum] what's this? Your nicotine gum. You wanted to stop looking for the bag cause you'd already found it. I know you have them, paulo, so where are they? !
Paulo: calm down, ok?
[nikki unscrews a glass bottle with a spider inside. ]
paulo: what the hell's that?
[nikki opens the bottle and thrusts it at paulo, causing the spider to land on his neck and bite him. ]
paulo: are you out of your mind?
Nikki: you remember dr. Arzt's friend. Did it bite you? Does it hurt? He told me why they call it the medusa spider. Wanna know why?
[paulo begins to shake and grabs nikki. ]
paulo: what did you do?
Nikki: because one look from medusa will turn anyone to stone, just like one bite from the spider will paralyze you, for about eight hours. It won't kill you, it'll just slow your heart rate down to the point of where even a doctor would have a hard time
[paulo falls to the ground. ]
nikki: hearing it beat. You won't be able to move a muscle, so i'll be able to do, all sorts of nasty things to you. And since it bit you on your neck, i'd say paralysis will happen fast. I'm guessing that you have the diamonds on you. Huh?
[nikki searches paulo. ]
nikki: in a shoe, maybe?
[finding nothing, she throws the shoe away, and it catches in a tree. ]
nikki: [pauses] i think i know where...
[she undoes paulo's belt and zipper, and pulls out the pouch from his underwear. ]
nikki: son of a bitch.
Paulo: i'm sorry.
Nikki: you're only sorry 'cause you got caught.
Paulo: i was... Afraid... Of losing you. If you found the diamonds, you wouldn't need me any more.
[as nikki looks on forgivingly, the clicking sound of the monster can be heard. As nikki looks around, numerous male medusa spiders approach. One crawls on nikki's leg, and she shakes it off, but not before it bites her. ]
nikki: ow, dammit! Oh no! No! No, no.
[she runs through the jungle and buries the diamond pouch in the dirt. She then arrives at the beach, finding hurley and sawyer. ]
hurley: er, you ok?
[nikki collapses face down, and is turned over by sawyer and hurley. ]
hurley: hey, hey, what happened?
Nikki: para... Lyzed.
[present - sawyer and hurley shovel sand over the bodies and the scattered diamonds. The rest of the survivors all begin to leave. Nikki's eyes open wide as sand is poured over them. Sawyer and hurley finish burying the pair, and walk away. ]
Act 1
[sawyer tugs desperately at the well rope. ]
miles: i think you can let go of that now.
[sawyer looks up and around. The flash has ended. He looks down. The rope dead-ends into solid earth, held up in tension only by sawyer's tugging. Miles, juliet, and jin look on at sawyer, who continues to tug. ]
sawyer: no. No! No!
[sawyer pulls down the length of the rope. ]
sawyer: no! No! No!
Juliet: james, don't.
Sawyer: come on! Help me! [panting]
[juliet kneels down beside sawyer as he claws at the earth around the rope. ]
juliet: james... [whispers] stop.
[he stops and looks up at her. ]
juliet: [normal voice] we can't help him. Wherever john went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
Miles: [looking up at the sky] yeah, i'd say way before.
Jin: what makes you
[miles points ahead. Jin looks. Sawyer and juliet get up to look as well. In the distance, not far from them, a colossal stone statue of an animal-headed egyptian deity looks out over the ocean toward the horizon. In its hands, it holds two massive stone ankhs. ]
[meanwhile, at the bottom of the well, locke struggles on the floor of a stone cave-like chamber, injured, in the darkness. He screams. ]
locke: james! Can you hear me? ! Can anyone hear me? !
[locke grabs on to a hold in the stone and pulls himself up, grunting. ]
locke: aah!
[locke staggers through the chamber over to the frozen wheel, where it rattles and creaks, moving by some unseen force behind it. Locke gets a good hold on it, and, with the sound of ice breaking loose and a loud clank, he lifts the wheel up and pulls it back. Green light emanates from behind it. ]
[topside, jin, miles, juliet, and sawyer stand about, and the earth begins to shake. Flashes shoot at them and they grab their heads. And fall to the ground, kneeling, as a buzzing and magnetic humming overtakes all other sound. Down below, a look of surprise comes over locke's face. Up above, the group is totally overcome by the rapid-fire flashes, and they all fall to the ground. White light envelopes everything, and the buzzing and humming stop. Miles holds his head, panting on the ground. Sawyer lifts himself up. ]
juliet: what the hell was that?
Miles: [panting] that one was different. It was... That was more like an earthquake.
[sawyer looks up to see the well has returned. ]
sawyer: [jumping up] locke!
Juliet: [jumping up after him] james, wait!
[sawyer leaps into the well, holding onto the rope. He doesn't get far. The well ends at ground level, blocked up by dirt and stones. ]
sawyer: [sighs] great. [panting]
[sawyer aborts his plan and climbs back out of the well. ]
juliet: my headache is gone.
Miles: yeah, mine is, too.
[miles checks his nose with his hand. ]
miles: and my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
[jin also checks his nose. ]
juliet: i think it's over. I think john did it.
[sawyer looks down the well. They all look around. ]
jin: now what?
Sawyer: now we wait for him to come back.
Juliet: for how long?
[sawyer looks back down the well, and then back up at juliet. ]
sawyer: as long as it takes.
[title card: three years later]
[hands place a tape reel on a reel-to-reel tape machine. Then the pick-up reel. They wrap the tape around the magnetic head, wind the two reels to take up the slack, and press a power button. Then, play. The music wows up to speed. It is tony orlando and dawn's "candida". A man in a dharma initiative jumpsuit with a mustache and sideburns begins gyrating with a cute brunette wearing a tight shirt that reads, in american flag-backed letters, "geronimo jackson". Behind them, a bank of eight black-and-white cathode ray tube monitors display various static outdoor scenes, mostly of zones having sonar fence pylons, and on the control panel underneath the monitor bank, a plate sits stacked with brownies, kept company by a dharma beer. Shelves line the room filled with manuals and tapes. The brunette pulls up the collar of the man's tan jumpsuit. ]
[lyrics: the stars won't come out / if they know that you're around]
phil: are you kidding me?
[a door slams. The man and the brunette turn to see another dharma-jumpsuited man standing at the entrance. ]
phil: i'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
Jerry: don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her. [chuckles]
rosie: yeah.
[phil turns off the reel-to-reel tape machine. The music stops. Jerry and rosie stop dancing. Both men have dharma initiative logo patches with five-pointed stars at the center. Below the patches, on the breast pockets are embroidered their first names and "security". ]
phil: she shouldn't be here, jerry. We're on the clock, man.
Jerry: ah, mellow out, phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
[jerry looks to rosie and chuckles. ]
phil: that's not the point. If lafleur finds out what you're doing here
jerry: lafleur's not gonna find out anything.
[something on the bank of monitors catches rosie's attention, and she leans in for a closer look. ]
phil: it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
Rosie: guys? What...
Jerry: relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
[on one of the monitors, a figure stumbles and falls to the ground next to a set of pylons. ]
rosie: guys. What...
[phil and jerry quit bickering and step over to the console. Phil sits down, looking carefully. The figure is hard to make out. ]
phil: is that a hostile?
Jerry: i don't know.
[jerry presses a button marked "overload""push to reset" on an audio monitoring panel. Audio comes over the loudspeakers. The long-haired, staggering figure is panting. ]
rosie: is that... Horace?
[on the monitor, "horace" takes a big swig from a bottle. Phil tugs around his mouth. ]
[outside, at the site of the staggering figure, in the dark of night. It is horace, horace goodspeed, dharma initiative mathematician. Horace sets down the bottle in the grass and reaches into a brown pack. ]
[back in the security station, the trio looks on to see what horace will do next. ]
[back outside, horace chomps on the largest cigar a man could get his lips around, and, humming drunkenly to himself, begins flicking a lighter. Putting the lighter to the end of the cigar]
[on the monitor, in vivid black and white, he removes the cigar from his mouth and its fuse starts flickering. Jerry looks closer. ]
[back outside, horace lobs the giant stogie with a grunt, and it leaves a trace of smoke as it arcs through the air, beyond a sonar fence pylon toward a young tree, which, a second later, explodes loudly. ]
[back in the security station, all three jump back at the noise. ]
jerry: oh, he's got dynamite.
Rosie: aah! [gasps]
phil: get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
Jerry: come on, rosie.
Phil: i told you not to bring her here. I told you!
[jerry rushes an indignant rosie to the door and shoves her out. ]
jerry: you gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go! [turning back to phil] okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
Phil: we gotta get lafleur.
Jerry: 3:00 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake lafleur up?
Phil: no, of course not, but
jerry: no, no, no. Maybemaybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
Phil: and maybe horace blows himself up, and lafleur kills us for not waking him.
[they both look over at the bank of monitors just in time to see another explosion. Instantly, they look back at each other, and run for the door. ]
phil: we gotta gonow!
[outside, in the dark, feet beat across the pavement. Jerry and phil run along a cement path through the barracks, stopping at the door of a house. On the porch, jerry doubles over, panting. ]
phil: do you wanna knock?
Jerry: [grunts] you knock.
Phil: fine.
[phil knocks meekly on the door. He looks at jerry and sighs. Then back at the door, and raps a bit harder. A porch light goes on, and an annoyed male voice calls from inside. ]
lafleur: what?
Phil: mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
[the door swings open. Both men straighten up to attention. ]
lafleur: [clears throat] what kind of situation?
Jerry: uh, it's, uh, horace.
Phil: he's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
[lafleur turns with a sigh. It's sawyer, clean-shaven and with washed hair, wearing a white undershirt. ]
sawyer: son of a bitch.
[he walks back into the house and grabs a jumpsuit similar to the other two men'sdharma logo, 5-pointed star in the middle, and on the pocket, "lafleur""head of security". Sawyer zips up the jumpsuit and joins the two men, who look frightened. The door slams behind them. ]
act 2
[a horn honks impatiently, and miles straume exits a door in the barracks, still pulling on a similar security jumpsuit. He pulls the door behind him and checks the knob. ]
miles: relax! I'm comin'!
[miles runs up to a dharma van and pulls open the passenger side door to join sawyer, who's driving. ]
miles: [sighs] hey, boss.
Sawyer: evening, enos. You got your zapper with ya?
Miles: yep. [sighs] you wanna tell me why i need it?
[sawyer shifts gears and begins driving off. ]
sawyer: [sighs] 'cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
Miles: why's he doin' that?
Sawyer: [sighs] 'cause he's loaded.
Miles: since when does horace drink?
Sawyer: he doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
[the blue dharma van drives off into the night. ]
[horace lies passed out in the grass, snoring, the dharma-brand whiskey bottle still in his right hand. His jumpsuit has an arrow patch on it and reads, "horace""mathematician". A few unexploded sticks of dynamite lay strewn in the grass around him, while what's left of an unfortunate tree burns like a campfire behind him. Footsteps approach from either side. ]
miles: oh, man.
Sawyer: all right. [sighs] you put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
Miles: why don't you put out the fire, pack up, andand i'll take him home?
Sawyer: you wanna tell amy where we found him?
[miles looks groundward. Sawyer smiles. ]
sawyer: help me get him up.
[they tug at both horace's arms, grunting. ]
[sawyer raps on a barracks door, horace slung over his left shoulder. He sighs, and the door opens. It's a woman, in her 30s, with dark red hair, curly. ]
amy: [gasps] oh, my god. Is he okay?
Sawyer: you tell me.
Amy: bring him inside.
[sawyer does. ]
amy: the couch. The couch is fine.
[sawyer grunts. Horace hits the couch like a sack of potatoes. The woman appears to be eight or nine months' pregnant. ]
amy: oh. Where'd you find him?
Sawyer: [catching his breath] by the flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
Amy: we had a fight. [sighs]
sawyer: must've been a doozy.
Amy: please, jim. It's personal.
Sawyer: personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
Amy: [sighs] it was about paul.
Sawyer: go on.
Amy: [grunts] oh.
[amy holds her belly. ]
sawyer: what's the matter? You okay?
[she falls forward in pain, grasping for sawyer. He gets up and helps her. ]
amy: [groans] ohhh! The babyit's coming. [groans and gasps] ohhh! !
Sawyer: oh, hell.
[title card: three years earlier]
[1974 - sawyer and juliet step out of some foliage to find daniel faraday kneeling alone in the jungle. ]
faraday: [muttering] i'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
Sawyer: [lowered voice, to juliet] where's red?
Juliet: i don't know.
[juliet walks over to faraday and stoops down to talk to him. Sawyer, miles and jin hang back. ]
faraday: [mutters indistinctly] no. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
Juliet: daniel? You okay?
Faraday: i'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
Juliet: daniel, where's charlotte?
Faraday: [voice breaking] she's not here. She... She's gone.
Juliet: where?
Faraday: she's... Dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... And she was... She was just gone.
[juliet nods sympathetically. ]
faraday: her... Body just... [crying] disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
Juliet: i'm so sorry.
Sawyer: hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
Faraday: of course it's over. Wherever we are now... Whenever we are now... We're here for good. [to juliet, or perhaps to himself] i won't do it.
Juliet: [whispers] okay. Okay.
Faraday: i won't. I'm not gonnai'mi'm...
Juliet: okay.
Faraday: i'm not gonnai wi won't.
Juliet: okay. Okay.
Faraday: tell...
Sawyer: okay. Swell. Until dan checks back in, i say we head back to the beach. When locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
Miles: the beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
Juliet: sawyer's right, miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
Miles: [to nobody in particular] or maybe when we get there, you'llyou'll wanna go back to the orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
Sawyer: hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
[sawyer tromps off. Juliet looks at miles. ]
miles: who put him in charge?
[juliet follows, and jin goes, too. ]
[a little later, miles leads the way, tossing a stick or bone in his hand. Faraday and jin are not far behind, and juliet and sawyer take up the rear. ]
sawyer: thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
Juliet: you should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
Sawyer: well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
Juliet: any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if i hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
Sawyer: well, i'm open to suggestions.
[they hear gunshots and stop in their tracks. Juliet and sawyer raise their rifles, the wwii-era rifles taken from 17-year-old charles widmore and ellie back in 1954. Sawyer begins marching through the foliage in the direction of the gunshots, and jin and juliet go, too, while faraday is more or less catatonic. They hear a woman sobbing in distance. ]
woman: [in distance] oh, no! No, paul! Oh, god! Oh, god!
[sawyer, jin, juliet, and miles run through a clearing. They stop when, from far away, they spot two unkempt-looking men wearing dingy clothes holding a woman at gunpoint in the middle of a meadow of tall grass. She holds her arms up at them as they get closer. ]
woman: no, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
[she seems to be talking to a man who lies on the ground. Of the two unkempt men, one has a shadow, while the other has a full beard. The one with the shadow takes away the dead man's handgun and stuffs it in the back of his pants, then resumes pointing his own handgun at the woman while the unkempt man with the full beard covers her head with a burlap sack. She falls to her knees. ]
woman: no, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just havingpaul. Paul, please. Oh, my god! No! [sobbing] no, paul, please. Please.
Juliet: who do you think they are?
Miles: who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are. [whispers, to faraday, who sits desolately on the ground behind them] hey. [normal voice] dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
Faraday: [lucidly] doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
Sawyer: [sternly] yeah, thanks anyway, plato. I'm going over there. [to juliet] you still got my back?
Juliet: absolutely.
Woman: paul, paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, paul!
[but paul is clearly dead, on the ground at the site of a picnic gone wrong: a blanket, plates of sandwiches, a wicker basket with a corked bottle of wine peeking out. ]
beard: on your feet!
Woman: [crying] no, i can't! I can't!
Beard: come on, get up! Now!
Woman: aah!
[the bearded man roughly lifts the woman to her feet. ]
beard: shut up!
Sawyer: [stepping forward] all right, drop the gun!
[shadow whips around and fires his handgun at sawyer. As quickly as he fires, a bullet hole erupts in his chest, and he looks down at it, then falls backward, dead. ]
woman: [screams] oh, god.
[the woman pants and gasps at the commotion, which she is blind to. Sawyer looks down at his rifle. He wasn't the one to have fired. He looks over and sees juliet lower her own rifle from her sight. He looks up to see beard lifting a rifle at him. Sawyer fires, and beard topples backwards, dead. The woman sobs with terror, the bag still over her head. Juliet and sawyer approach and disarm the two dead men. Sawyer removes the bag from her head. ]
sawyer: it's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
[the woman has red, curly hair. Her name is amy. ]
amy: who are you?
[answerless, sawyer looks at juliet, then back at the woman. ]
act 3
[amy sits wide-legged in the grass next to the dead paul, stroking his hair and his chest. He wears a security jumpsuit similar to those we've seen earlier. Daniel eyes her. Juliet cleans up the picnic while miles patrols with her rifle. ]
juliet: [to sawyer] her friend's wearing a dharma jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
Sawyer: the guys with the bagsothers?
Juliet: beats me.
Sawyer: what, y'all don't know each other?
Juliet: before my time.
Jin: sawyer. Walkie.
[jin pulls a walkie-talkie off shadow and tosses it to sawyer. Sawyer fiddles with its dial and gets static hisses. ]
juliet: we need to go.
Sawyer: i'm on it.
[sawyer goes over to amy and stoops down to talk to her. ]
sawyer: listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
Amy: who are you people?
Sawyer: our ship wrecked here on the way to tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of thisthose two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
Amy: we have to bury them.
Sawyer: bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
Amy: [getting up] wewewe have to. The truce. [rubbing her mouth] oh, god. [sniffles] we have to bury them. Andand we have... [voice breaking] we have... And we have to bring ithim back home. We have to bring paul back with us. Please. Please? [whispers] please.
[she sobs. ]
jin: [stepping forward] i'll carry him.
Sawyer: all right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
Amy: he wasn't... My friend. He was my husband. [sniffles]
[the group hikes down hilly terrain, with steep mountain peaks poking up behind them. Jin carries paul's body over his shoulder. ]
sawyer: [to miles and juliet] all right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
Miles: you really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
Sawyer: i'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
Juliet: [shouting] daniel! Stop!
[faraday stops, looks up. A row of concrete pylons line the grassy landscape. Each concrete pylon has two copper-green hemispherical caps on its side near its top. Juliet comes forward toward amy, who has also stopped this side of the pylons. ]
juliet: turn it off.
Amy: [looking down, and then up again] turn what off?
Juliet: whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
[sawyer looks at juliet, and she looks back. ]
amy: where did you say your ship was going?
Sawyer: listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
Amy: okay. Okay, fine.
[amy moves to a pylon that has mounted near its bottom a control box. She types in the code 3-8-5-6 and the panel unlocks with a beep, allowing her to pull it upward to open the panel box with a click. She reaches in and pulls something out. ]
sawyer: [whispers] "sonic fence"? Didn't i say let me do the talking?
Juliet: [whispers] one more step, dan would've fried his brain.
Sawyer: his brain's already fried.
Amy: [announcing] okay, it's off.
Sawyer: you first.
[amy proceeds. A high-pitched electrical buzz is heard as she passes between the pylons, but she is otherwise fine. She turns back to the others. ]
amy: see? It's fine.
Sawyer: all right, let's go.
[they all move forward at once. ]
sawyer: and going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'
[a high-pitched electrical buzzing brings jin, sawyer, juliet, miles and daniel fall to their knees, grunting. They writhe on the ground and then go motionless. The buzzing stops, and amy removes a pair of white earplugs from her ears and looks around. ]
[title card: three years later. ]
[1977 - a woman screams in the agony of labor. ]
amy: [screaming] it hurts! Oh!
[a doctor in a lab coat bearing the dharma initiative patch of the staff removes his stethoscope from his ears. ]
doctor: you're gonna be okay, amy. Just try and relax.
[amy inhales and exhales deeply. The doctor steps away, past a nurse carrying a chart, and finds sawyer loitering, pacing amongst the empty hospital beds. This is the medical office at the barracks. ]
doctor: where's horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
Sawyer: he's unavailable.
Doctor: look, amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
Sawyer: what the hell does that mean?
Doctor: it's upside down. She needs a caesarean.
Sawyer: well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
Doctor: i'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
[amy screams a terrible scream. ]
sawyer: can you deliver this baby or not?
Doctor: i don't know.
[sawyer rushes out the door. ]
[outside, sawyer skirts some trees into a garage/depot with fuel containers, oil barrels and tires strewn about. A mechanic works on one of the blue dharma vans. ]
sawyer: [to the mechanic] hey, man. Where is she?
[the mechanic points to the next van over. Sawyer finds a figure in a dark blue jumpsuit working with a whirring grinder underneath a blue dharma van. The grinder saw sparks. Sawyer knocks, and the whirring stops. Juliet wheels herself out from underneath the vehicle. Her jumpsuit's dharma logo patch has a wrench in the middle of it, and her embroidered pocket reads "juliet""motor pool". ]
juliet: what's up?
Sawyer: [lowered voice] amy's having her baby.
Juliet: [taking off her protective goggles] what?
Sawyer: [exasperatedly pulling juliet up] mm. [whispers] did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a caesarean.
[juliet wheels sawyer around, switching positions with him. ]
juliet: [lowered voice] we had an agreement.
Sawyer: screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
Juliet: don't you understand that every time i try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
Sawyer: well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
[juliet throws her work gloves at sawyer and moves off. Sawyer sighs. ]
[back inside the medical office, amy breathes deeply and quickly, while juliet examines her, a hand on her abdomen. Sawyer faces off with the doctor a few paces away. ]
juliet: the baby's breech?
Doctor: yes, but
juliet: did you try an external cephalic version?
Doctor: what? No. I
juliet: it's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutureshalf-round if you've got themand an epidural anesthetic.
Doctor: you're gonna need? Where is horace?
Sawyer: i'm speaking for horace now, and i say she's delivering this baby.
Doctor: i don't think it's a good idea.
Amy: i want her. I want her to do it. Huh? [panting] mm.
Sawyer: you heard the lady.
[the doctor stands down and goes away. Sawyer steps up to juliet. ]
sawyer: listen... You're gonna do great. I know you are.
[juliet brings her focus back to her task. ]
juliet: okay.
Amy: [cries] oh!
[juliet pulls on a stethoscope. ]
juliet: [whispers] okay. Shh.
[amy cries. Sawyer heads outside. ]
juliet: [whispers] hey.
[sawyer paces outside the medical office. A voice interrupts his worrying. It's not quite a voice we've ever heard before. ]
jin: [fluently] is everything okay?
Sawyer: amy went into labor.
Jin: i know. Is she okay?
Sawyer: i don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
Jin: juliet?
Sawyer: yeah, i pulled her out of retirement.
[the men sit down on a bench. ]
sawyer: any luck?
Jin: we finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
Sawyer: well, 1-3-4 then.
Jin: how long do we look, james?
Sawyer: as long as it takes.
[juliet comes out, her face flushed. The men stand up. ]
sawyer: what happened?
Juliet: [sighs] it's a boy.
Sawyer: he's okay? She's okay?
Juliet: [sobbing] everyone's okay. [sighs]
[a proud grin breaks out on sawyer's face, and he looks around, then back at juliet, with a grin. ]
act 4
[1974 - sawyer lays unconscious on a couch. His several days of stubble tell us we're back to the "three years earlier" time period. ]
sawyer: mm.
[sawyer groans, sighs, and grunts awake. He rubs his eyes, lifts his head, and looks up to see horace, mathematician standing over him, leaning against a pool table. They are in the rec room at the barracks. ]
horace: how's your head?
Sawyer: it hurts.
[sawyer sighs, sits up, and looks around. ]
sawyer: where are my people?
Horace: they're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and i really appreciate what you did.
Sawyer: well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
Horace: look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... Why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
Sawyer: my name's james lafleur. You can call me jim.
Horace: how'd you get to the island, jim?
Sawyer: if my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
Horace: they told me i need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
[sawyer looks down, and stands up. ]
sawyer: we got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
[a plate of sandwiches and a glass of milk sit on the pool table. Sawyer helps himself to the glass of milk and sits back down on the couch. ]
horace: what kind of ship?
Sawyer: a salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of portsmouth, england, called the black rock. You heard of her?
Horace: can't say that i have.
[sawyer sips milk. ]
horace: so... Once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
Sawyer: some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
Horace: hmm. Well... [clears throat, removes eyeglasses] i tell you what, jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
Sawyer: send 'em where?
Horace: there's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
[horace turns to leave. ]
sawyer: hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
Horace: nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the dharma initiative. And look, i don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, jim, but you are not dharma material.
[horace leaves. ]
[outside, faraday, miles, juliet and jin sit around a patio table in the barracks compound. Indistinct conversations and laughter of dharma initiative residents surround them. ]
miles: we're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
Juliet: sawyer's gonna be fine.
Miles: what are you lookin' at?
Juliet: i lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
Miles: you were in the dharma initiative?
Juliet: no. The others took over these barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
Miles: well... Welcome home.
Jin: daniel... No more flash?
[we revolve around faraday as he speaks. ]
faraday: no. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
[the voice of a tiny girl attracts the attention first of jin, then of faraday. ]
red-headed girl: [babbling] hey, mum. Where's dad?
[faraday spots a very small red-headed girl in a red dress, dancing and running near an adult companion. ]
woman: [british accent] come on, luv. [speaks indistinctly]
[the tiny red-headed girl appears to wave to daniel. ]
faraday: [whispers] charlotte.
[horace walks up with sawyer. ]
horace: hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, mr. Lafleur here can fill you in on the situation.
[horace departs. ]
miles: "mr. Lafleur"?
Sawyer: it's creole. I improvised.
Juliet: what happened in there?
Sawyer: well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to tahiti.
Miles: how's that bad news?
[suddenly, an alarm blares. All look up. Men and women around them start running with flashlights. ]
woman: you guys, come on! Now!
Man: let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
Man: let's go! Get out of here!
Man: come on! Come on!
[sawyer's group are bewildered by the commotion. A man in a security jumpsuit runs up to them carrying a rifle. It is phil, whom we've seen three years in the future. ]
phil: come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
[as the alarm continues blaring, and indistinct shouts come from all around, phil runs off into the barracks compound, and sawyer's group follow. ]
[juliet bursts through a house door, followed by sawyer, jin, phil, miles, and faraday. A lone woman stands in the kitchen, peering out the window, a rifle lifted and at the ready. ]
phil: heather, keep an eye on them.
[phil leaves and closes the door behind him. The alarm stops. Heather returns her attentions to the kitchen window. Sawyer looks cautiously out the living room window. Juliet comes to the window and looks out as well. In the distance, a man carrying a lighted torch enters the barracks through the tree line. He plants his torch in the grassy lawn and proceeds toward the houses. As he gets closer, juliet makes out who it is: richard alpert. She winces and exhales. She turns toward sawyer and gives a subtle nod, as if to say, "yes, it's one of mine. "]
sawyer: uh-oh.
Act 5
[the barracks, night. Rows of parked bicycles, picket fences, picnic tables, patio furniture, and park benches. A gazebo. An unlit portable grill. No one around. All is still, save a hammock that swings slightly, either from the breeze or from having been just vacated in the alarm. The front door of a yellow house opens, and horace goodspeed peers out. Not far away, richard alpert stands alone under the lamplight, wearing close-cropped hair and a navy blue button-down shirt, looking little different than the last time we saw him 20 years earlier. Horace, hands in the pockets of his jumpsuit, strides out to meet richard. ]
horace: hello, mr. Alpert.
Richard: hello, mr. Goodspeed.
Horace: i wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
Richard: that fence may keep other things out, but not us.
[richard steps in closer. ]
richard: the only thing that does keep us out, horace, is our truce... Which you've now broken.
Horace: i don't know what you're talking about.
Richard: where are my two men?
[miles peers out of the window of the house he and sawyer's group have taken refuge in. He can only hear richard and horace argue indistinctly in the distance, while richard's torch continues to burn further away. Richard raises a finger to horace, and horace raises a hand back in debate. ]
miles: [turning to the group inside] you know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
Sawyer: hold your horses, banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
[horace bursts in through the front door with phil. ]
horace: okay, lafleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
Sawyer: well, that depends on how hard he looks.
[horace sighs and turns back to phil. ]
horace: call the arrow. Tell them we're at condition one. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
Phil: yes, sir.
Sawyer: let me talk to him.
Horace: excuse me?
Sawyer: your buddy out there with the eyelinerlet me talk to him.
Horace: we had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
Sawyer: i understand i'm the one that killed his men, and i'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why i did it.
Horace: [shaking his head] i can't let you do that.
Sawyer: well, it's a good thing i ain't asking your permission.
[sawyer turns past horace and opens the door, but juliet stops him gently. ]
juliet: james, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Sawyer: not yet. [sighs] but i'll figure somethin' out.
[sawyer leaves and closes the door behind him. Outside, sawyer walks up to richard, who is seated on a park bench. ]
sawyer: hello, richard.
Richard: i'm sorry. Do we know each other?
Sawyer: i'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and i defended myself.
Richard: is that so?
Sawyer: that's so.
Richard: your people know that you're telling me this?
Sawyer: they ain't my people, hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
Richard: if you're not a member of the dharma initiative, then what are you?
[sawyer sits down on the bench next to richard. ]
sawyer: did you bury the bomb?
Richard: excuse me?
Sawyer: the hydrogen bomb with "jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
Richard: how...
[richard looks at sawyer interestedly. ]
sawyer: yeah, i know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... He went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is john locke, and i'm waitin' for him to come back. So... You still think i'm a member of the damn dharma initiative?
Richard: no. I guess i don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
[sawyer sighs. ]
richard: now what are we gonna do about that?
[moments later. Paul's dead body, now quite pale, rests on a bed. Horace enters the house with sawyer. Amy holds vigil over paul's body, still looking at him mournfully. ]
horace: how are you doing, amy?
[amy wipes her nose with a tissue. ]
amy: [sighs and sniffles] is he gone?
[she tries to dry her eyes with her hand. ]
amy: alpert?
Horace: no, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
Amy: [alarmed] you told him? Why?
Horace: we had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... Well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take paul's body back with him.
Amy: [gasps] mm. [sighs, gasps] no. Oh!
Horace: hey.
Amy: oh. [cries]
[horace kneels down next to amy. Sawyer sits in the background on a kitchen stool. ]
horace: hey, ames. Listen, w
[she sighs. ]
horace: we've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
[amy looks at sawyer. ]
amy: they can take him. He would want to keep us safe. [sobs] [voice breaks] can i have a minute, please?
[horace gives amy some privacy. Sniffling and sighing, she removes a simple necklace from around paul's necka brown wooden ankh on a black string. She pulls it close to her mouth, cherishing it, then gets up and walks past sawyer. ]
sawyer: i'm sorry.
[amy leaves the house. Horace looks at the body. ]
sawyer: you need some help?
Horace: hmm? Oh. Nah, i've got it. Thanks.
[sawyer turns to leave through the back. ]
horace: hey, jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morningit returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
Sawyer: thanks.
[sawyer walks out. ]
[moments later, sawyer finds juliet looking out over the water on the submarine dock. The galaga is docked there presently. ]
sawyer: i bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, locke'll be back by then.
[sawyer sits down on some crates. ]
juliet: and then what?
Sawyer: what do you mean, "then what"?
Juliet: [turning up to look at him] locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now i've got my chance.
[sawyer looks devastated. ]
juliet: i'm going to leave.
Sawyer: [sighs] you do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... It don't exist yet.
Juliet: [wiping her face] it's not a reason not to go.
Sawyer: well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and mr. "i speak to dead people"?
[juliet smiles. ]
sawyer: and jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
Juliet: [smiling] you'll be fine.
Sawyer: maybe... But who's gonna get my back?
[juliet looks up at him, with a little bit of touched surprise at his sincerity. He disengages with a self-conscious smile and a sigh. ]
sawyer: come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all i'm asking. Two weeks.
Juliet: all right. Two weeks.
[sawyer smiles. So does juliet, looking away. Sawyer looks back out over the water. ]
[title card: three years later]
[1977 - a chessboard, as someone makes a move. It is the barracks on a lovely day. Sawyer strolls down a path past a parked blue bicycle. A blonde woman tosses a volleyball with her young daughter. Turning to a patch of the gardener's handiwork, he spots a common sunflower, dainty and perfect, and picks it, bringing it to his nose for a sniff. He smiles. ]
[a vase of beautiful flowers adorns a tabletop. It is partnered with a bottle of swan-labeled dharma initiative merlot and a big bowl of delicious-looking garden salad. The table is set for dinner. The door opens and sawyer enters the house. ]
sawyer: mmm, somethin' smells good.
Juliet: hey there.
[juliet, wearing an oven mitt, brings a pot of pasta from the stove to the sink for straining. The kitchen counter is covered with carrots, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants, mushrooms, tomatoes, and lettuce. Leaning against one of the pillars, sawyer brings the sunflower into view in front of him. Juliet looks up and notices, smiling. She puts her arms akimbo. ]
juliet: is that for me?
Sawyer: you were amazing today.
[juliet takes the sunflower and puts her arms around him in a big hug. Sawyer chuckles. ]
juliet: thank you for believing in me.
Sawyer: ah.
[her arms still around his neck, juliet looks into sawyer's eyes, and gives him a peck on the mouth. She laughs. ]
sawyer: mm.
[he kisses her deeply. ]
juliet: i love you.
Sawyer: mmm. I love you, too.
[they kiss again. ]
sawyer: mmm.
Juliet: mmm.
Act 6
[his eyeglasses on, sawyer reads a hardback book, sans dust jacket, seated in a comfy chair. He hears the sound of a man stirring awake, and puts the book down. ]
sawyer: wake up, boss.
[horace goodpeed lies on the couch where sawyer had placed him early that morning. He slowly comes to, holding his head. ]
horace: ah. [groans] oh!
Sawyer: how's your head?
Horace: [sitting up] it hurts.
[sawyer puts the book down on the coffee table and removes his glasses. ]
sawyer: i got good news and bad news. What you want first?
Horace: [sighs] good news.
Sawyer: you're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
Horace: oh, gosh. Amy... She had the baby?
Sawyer: [smiling] it's a boy.
Horace: a boy?
Sawyer: mm.
Horace: ohh. [groans]
[horace puts a glass of icewater to his right temple. ]
sawyer: [sighs] now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
Horace: i was, uh... [swallows some icewater] i was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so i went to grab a pair of amy's, and... I found this...
[he produces the ankh necklace from his breast pocket. ]
horace: ... In the back of her drawer. It was paul's.
Sawyer: you got in a fight over a necklace?
Horace: i know. [sighs] but... It's only been three years, jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
[sawyer thinks. ]
sawyer: [sighs] i had a thing for a girl once. And i had a shot at her, but i didn't take it. For a little while, i'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now i can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her faceit's... She's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... Is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
[early morning, in sawyer and juliet's house, the couple lie asleep in bed, tightly spooned together. The telephone rings. Juliet wakens and tugs at sawyer, as if to say, "answer it! "]
sawyer: oh. [grunts]
[the phone keeps ringing. Sawyer, wearing boxers and a wifebeater, crawls over juliet to answer the black rotary phone, grunting, groaning, and sighing as he does so. ]
sawyer: [grunts] what? ... Wait. What? ... Hno. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the north valley.
[he hangs up and jumps out of bed. ]
juliet: who was it?
[sawyer retrieves his glasses from the dresser and snags a jumpsuit from the closet, rattling hangers. He sighs. ]
juliet: james, what's going on?
Sawyer: it was jin.
[sawyer turns to leave. ]
juliet: is everything okay?
[he turns back. ]
sawyer: yeah. I just... I gotta go.
[he does so. ]
[the north valley, as early morning light touches the shoreside meadow. Sawyer drives up in a blue dharma initiative jeep. He parks the jeep and gets out. A blue dharma van drives nearer, then stops. The passenger door opens and hurley steps out, wearing a jeans jacket and carrying a guitar case. Jack steps out of the back in his suit and tie and breathes the island air. Sawyer looks at them in amazement. He removes his eyeglasses as kate steps out from behind hurley, wearing a tank top and black pants. Her facethose freckles. Kate. Sawyer. ]
act 1
[sawyer tugs desperately at the well rope. ]
miles: i think you can let go of that now.
[sawyer looks up and around. The flash has ended. He looks down. The rope dead-ends into solid earth, held up in tension only by sawyer's tugging. Miles, juliet, and jin look on at sawyer, who continues to tug. ]
sawyer: no. No! No!
[sawyer pulls down the length of the rope. ]
sawyer: no! No! No!
Juliet: james, don't.
Sawyer: come on! Help me! [panting]
[juliet kneels down beside sawyer as he claws at the earth around the rope. ]
juliet: james... [whispers] stop.
[he stops and looks up at her. ]
juliet: [normal voice] we can't help him. Wherever john went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
Miles: [looking up at the sky] yeah, i'd say way before.
Jin: what makes you
[miles points ahead. Jin looks. Sawyer and juliet get up to look as well. In the distance, not far from them, a colossal stone statue of an animal-headed egyptian deity looks out over the ocean toward the horizon. In its hands, it holds two massive stone ankhs. ]
[meanwhile, at the bottom of the well, locke struggles on the floor of a stone cave-like chamber, injured, in the darkness. He screams. ]
locke: james! Can you hear me? ! Can anyone hear me? !
[locke grabs on to a hold in the stone and pulls himself up, grunting. ]
locke: aah!
[locke staggers through the chamber over to the frozen wheel, where it rattles and creaks, moving by some unseen force behind it. Locke gets a good hold on it, and, with the sound of ice breaking loose and a loud clank, he lifts the wheel up and pulls it back. Green light emanates from behind it. ]
[topside, jin, miles, juliet, and sawyer stand about, and the earth begins to shake. Flashes shoot at them and they grab their heads. And fall to the ground, kneeling, as a buzzing and magnetic humming overtakes all other sound. Down below, a look of surprise comes over locke's face. Up above, the group is totally overcome by the rapid-fire flashes, and they all fall to the ground. White light envelopes everything, and the buzzing and humming stop. Miles holds his head, panting on the ground. Sawyer lifts himself up. ]
juliet: what the hell was that?
Miles: [panting] that one was different. It was... That was more like an earthquake.
[sawyer looks up to see the well has returned. ]
sawyer: [jumping up] locke!
Juliet: [jumping up after him] james, wait!
[sawyer leaps into the well, holding onto the rope. He doesn't get far. The well ends at ground level, blocked up by dirt and stones. ]
sawyer: [sighs] great. [panting]
[sawyer aborts his plan and climbs back out of the well. ]
juliet: my headache is gone.
Miles: yeah, mine is, too.
[miles checks his nose with his hand. ]
miles: and my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
[jin also checks his nose. ]
juliet: i think it's over. I think john did it.
[sawyer looks down the well. They all look around. ]
jin: now what?
Sawyer: now we wait for him to come back.
Juliet: for how long?
[sawyer looks back down the well, and then back up at juliet. ]
sawyer: as long as it takes.
[title card: three years later]
[hands place a tape reel on a reel-to-reel tape machine. Then the pick-up reel. They wrap the tape around the magnetic head, wind the two reels to take up the slack, and press a power button. Then, play. The music wows up to speed. It is tony orlando and dawn's "candida". A man in a dharma initiative jumpsuit with a mustache and sideburns begins gyrating with a cute brunette wearing a tight shirt that reads, in american flag-backed letters, "geronimo jackson". Behind them, a bank of eight black-and-white cathode ray tube monitors display various static outdoor scenes, mostly of zones having sonar fence pylons, and on the control panel underneath the monitor bank, a plate sits stacked with brownies, kept company by a dharma beer. Shelves line the room filled with manuals and tapes. The brunette pulls up the collar of the man's tan jumpsuit. ]
[lyrics: the stars won't come out / if they know that you're around]
phil: are you kidding me?
[a door slams. The man and the brunette turn to see another dharma-jumpsuited man standing at the entrance. ]
phil: i'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
Jerry: don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her. [chuckles]
rosie: yeah.
[phil turns off the reel-to-reel tape machine. The music stops. Jerry and rosie stop dancing. Both men have dharma initiative logo patches with five-pointed stars at the center. Below the patches, on the breast pockets are embroidered their first names and "security". ]
phil: she shouldn't be here, jerry. We're on the clock, man.
Jerry: ah, mellow out, phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
[jerry looks to rosie and chuckles. ]
phil: that's not the point. If lafleur finds out what you're doing here
jerry: lafleur's not gonna find out anything.
[something on the bank of monitors catches rosie's attention, and she leans in for a closer look. ]
phil: it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
Rosie: guys? What...
Jerry: relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
[on one of the monitors, a figure stumbles and falls to the ground next to a set of pylons. ]
rosie: guys. What...
[phil and jerry quit bickering and step over to the console. Phil sits down, looking carefully. The figure is hard to make out. ]
phil: is that a hostile?
Jerry: i don't know.
[jerry presses a button marked "overload""push to reset" on an audio monitoring panel. Audio comes over the loudspeakers. The long-haired, staggering figure is panting. ]
rosie: is that... Horace?
[on the monitor, "horace" takes a big swig from a bottle. Phil tugs around his mouth. ]
[outside, at the site of the staggering figure, in the dark of night. It is horace, horace goodspeed, dharma initiative mathematician. Horace sets down the bottle in the grass and reaches into a brown pack. ]
[back in the security station, the trio looks on to see what horace will do next. ]
[back outside, horace chomps on the largest cigar a man could get his lips around, and, humming drunkenly to himself, begins flicking a lighter. Putting the lighter to the end of the cigar]
[on the monitor, in vivid black and white, he removes the cigar from his mouth and its fuse starts flickering. Jerry looks closer. ]
[back outside, horace lobs the giant stogie with a grunt, and it leaves a trace of smoke as it arcs through the air, beyond a sonar fence pylon toward a young tree, which, a second later, explodes loudly. ]
[back in the security station, all three jump back at the noise. ]
jerry: oh, he's got dynamite.
Rosie: aah! [gasps]
phil: get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
Jerry: come on, rosie.
Phil: i told you not to bring her here. I told you!
[jerry rushes an indignant rosie to the door and shoves her out. ]
jerry: you gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go! [turning back to phil] okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
Phil: we gotta get lafleur.
Jerry: 3:00 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake lafleur up?
Phil: no, of course not, but
jerry: no, no, no. Maybemaybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
Phil: and maybe horace blows himself up, and lafleur kills us for not waking him.
[they both look over at the bank of monitors just in time to see another explosion. Instantly, they look back at each other, and run for the door. ]
phil: we gotta gonow!
[outside, in the dark, feet beat across the pavement. Jerry and phil run along a cement path through the barracks, stopping at the door of a house. On the porch, jerry doubles over, panting. ]
phil: do you wanna knock?
Jerry: [grunts] you knock.
Phil: fine.
[phil knocks meekly on the door. He looks at jerry and sighs. Then back at the door, and raps a bit harder. A porch light goes on, and an annoyed male voice calls from inside. ]
lafleur: what?
Phil: mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
[the door swings open. Both men straighten up to attention. ]
lafleur: [clears throat] what kind of situation?
Jerry: uh, it's, uh, horace.
Phil: he's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
[lafleur turns with a sigh. It's sawyer, clean-shaven and with washed hair, wearing a white undershirt. ]
sawyer: son of a bitch.
[he walks back into the house and grabs a jumpsuit similar to the other two men'sdharma logo, 5-pointed star in the middle, and on the pocket, "lafleur""head of security". Sawyer zips up the jumpsuit and joins the two men, who look frightened. The door slams behind them. ]
act 2
[a horn honks impatiently, and miles straume exits a door in the barracks, still pulling on a similar security jumpsuit. He pulls the door behind him and checks the knob. ]
miles: relax! I'm comin'!
[miles runs up to a dharma van and pulls open the passenger side door to join sawyer, who's driving. ]
miles: [sighs] hey, boss.
Sawyer: evening, enos. You got your zapper with ya?
Miles: yep. [sighs] you wanna tell me why i need it?
[sawyer shifts gears and begins driving off. ]
sawyer: [sighs] 'cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
Miles: why's he doin' that?
Sawyer: [sighs] 'cause he's loaded.
Miles: since when does horace drink?
Sawyer: he doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
[the blue dharma van drives off into the night. ]
[horace lies passed out in the grass, snoring, the dharma-brand whiskey bottle still in his right hand. His jumpsuit has an arrow patch on it and reads, "horace""mathematician". A few unexploded sticks of dynamite lay strewn in the grass around him, while what's left of an unfortunate tree burns like a campfire behind him. Footsteps approach from either side. ]
miles: oh, man.
Sawyer: all right. [sighs] you put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
Miles: why don't you put out the fire, pack up, andand i'll take him home?
Sawyer: you wanna tell amy where we found him?
[miles looks groundward. Sawyer smiles. ]
sawyer: help me get him up.
[they tug at both horace's arms, grunting. ]
[sawyer raps on a barracks door, horace slung over his left shoulder. He sighs, and the door opens. It's a woman, in her 30s, with dark red hair, curly. ]
amy: [gasps] oh, my god. Is he okay?
Sawyer: you tell me.
Amy: bring him inside.
[sawyer does. ]
amy: the couch. The couch is fine.
[sawyer grunts. Horace hits the couch like a sack of potatoes. The woman appears to be eight or nine months' pregnant. ]
amy: oh. Where'd you find him?
Sawyer: [catching his breath] by the flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
Amy: we had a fight. [sighs]
sawyer: must've been a doozy.
Amy: please, jim. It's personal.
Sawyer: personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
Amy: [sighs] it was about paul.
Sawyer: go on.
Amy: [grunts] oh.
[amy holds her belly. ]
sawyer: what's the matter? You okay?
[she falls forward in pain, grasping for sawyer. He gets up and helps her. ]
amy: [groans] ohhh! The babyit's coming. [groans and gasps] ohhh! !
Sawyer: oh, hell.
[title card: three years earlier]
[1974 - sawyer and juliet step out of some foliage to find daniel faraday kneeling alone in the jungle. ]
faraday: [muttering] i'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
Sawyer: [lowered voice, to juliet] where's red?
Juliet: i don't know.
[juliet walks over to faraday and stoops down to talk to him. Sawyer, miles and jin hang back. ]
faraday: [mutters indistinctly] no. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
Juliet: daniel? You okay?
Faraday: i'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
Juliet: daniel, where's charlotte?
Faraday: [voice breaking] she's not here. She... She's gone.
Juliet: where?
Faraday: she's... Dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... And she was... She was just gone.
[juliet nods sympathetically. ]
faraday: her... Body just... [crying] disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
Juliet: i'm so sorry.
Sawyer: hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
Faraday: of course it's over. Wherever we are now... Whenever we are now... We're here for good. [to juliet, or perhaps to himself] i won't do it.
Juliet: [whispers] okay. Okay.
Faraday: i won't. I'm not gonnai'mi'm...
Juliet: okay.
Faraday: i'm not gonnai wi won't.
Juliet: okay. Okay.
Faraday: tell...
Sawyer: okay. Swell. Until dan checks back in, i say we head back to the beach. When locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
Miles: the beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
Juliet: sawyer's right, miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
Miles: [to nobody in particular] or maybe when we get there, you'llyou'll wanna go back to the orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
Sawyer: hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
[sawyer tromps off. Juliet looks at miles. ]
miles: who put him in charge?
[juliet follows, and jin goes, too. ]
[a little later, miles leads the way, tossing a stick or bone in his hand. Faraday and jin are not far behind, and juliet and sawyer take up the rear. ]
sawyer: thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
Juliet: you should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
Sawyer: well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
Juliet: any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if i hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
Sawyer: well, i'm open to suggestions.
[they hear gunshots and stop in their tracks. Juliet and sawyer raise their rifles, the wwii-era rifles taken from 17-year-old charles widmore and ellie back in 1954. Sawyer begins marching through the foliage in the direction of the gunshots, and jin and juliet go, too, while faraday is more or less catatonic. They hear a woman sobbing in distance. ]
woman: [in distance] oh, no! No, paul! Oh, god! Oh, god!
[sawyer, jin, juliet, and miles run through a clearing. They stop when, from far away, they spot two unkempt-looking men wearing dingy clothes holding a woman at gunpoint in the middle of a meadow of tall grass. She holds her arms up at them as they get closer. ]
woman: no, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
[she seems to be talking to a man who lies on the ground. Of the two unkempt men, one has a shadow, while the other has a full beard. The one with the shadow takes away the dead man's handgun and stuffs it in the back of his pants, then resumes pointing his own handgun at the woman while the unkempt man with the full beard covers her head with a burlap sack. She falls to her knees. ]
woman: no, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just havingpaul. Paul, please. Oh, my god! No! [sobbing] no, paul, please. Please.
Juliet: who do you think they are?
Miles: who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are. [whispers, to faraday, who sits desolately on the ground behind them] hey. [normal voice] dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
Faraday: [lucidly] doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
Sawyer: [sternly] yeah, thanks anyway, plato. I'm going over there. [to juliet] you still got my back?
Juliet: absolutely.
Woman: paul, paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, paul!
[but paul is clearly dead, on the ground at the site of a picnic gone wrong: a blanket, plates of sandwiches, a wicker basket with a corked bottle of wine peeking out. ]
beard: on your feet!
Woman: [crying] no, i can't! I can't!
Beard: come on, get up! Now!
Woman: aah!
[the bearded man roughly lifts the woman to her feet. ]
beard: shut up!
Sawyer: [stepping forward] all right, drop the gun!
[shadow whips around and fires his handgun at sawyer. As quickly as he fires, a bullet hole erupts in his chest, and he looks down at it, then falls backward, dead. ]
woman: [screams] oh, god.
[the woman pants and gasps at the commotion, which she is blind to. Sawyer looks down at his rifle. He wasn't the one to have fired. He looks over and sees juliet lower her own rifle from her sight. He looks up to see beard lifting a rifle at him. Sawyer fires, and beard topples backwards, dead. The woman sobs with terror, the bag still over her head. Juliet and sawyer approach and disarm the two dead men. Sawyer removes the bag from her head. ]
sawyer: it's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
[the woman has red, curly hair. Her name is amy. ]
amy: who are you?
[answerless, sawyer looks at juliet, then back at the woman. ]
act 3
[amy sits wide-legged in the grass next to the dead paul, stroking his hair and his chest. He wears a security jumpsuit similar to those we've seen earlier. Daniel eyes her. Juliet cleans up the picnic while miles patrols with her rifle. ]
juliet: [to sawyer] her friend's wearing a dharma jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
Sawyer: the guys with the bagsothers?
Juliet: beats me.
Sawyer: what, y'all don't know each other?
Juliet: before my time.
Jin: sawyer. Walkie.
[jin pulls a walkie-talkie off shadow and tosses it to sawyer. Sawyer fiddles with its dial and gets static hisses. ]
juliet: we need to go.
Sawyer: i'm on it.
[sawyer goes over to amy and stoops down to talk to her. ]
sawyer: listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
Amy: who are you people?
Sawyer: our ship wrecked here on the way to tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of thisthose two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
Amy: we have to bury them.
Sawyer: bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
Amy: [getting up] wewewe have to. The truce. [rubbing her mouth] oh, god. [sniffles] we have to bury them. Andand we have... [voice breaking] we have... And we have to bring ithim back home. We have to bring paul back with us. Please. Please? [whispers] please.
[she sobs. ]
jin: [stepping forward] i'll carry him.
Sawyer: all right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
Amy: he wasn't... My friend. He was my husband. [sniffles]
[the group hikes down hilly terrain, with steep mountain peaks poking up behind them. Jin carries paul's body over his shoulder. ]
sawyer: [to miles and juliet] all right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
Miles: you really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
Sawyer: i'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
Juliet: [shouting] daniel! Stop!
[faraday stops, looks up. A row of concrete pylons line the grassy landscape. Each concrete pylon has two copper-green hemispherical caps on its side near its top. Juliet comes forward toward amy, who has also stopped this side of the pylons. ]
juliet: turn it off.
Amy: [looking down, and then up again] turn what off?
Juliet: whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
[sawyer looks at juliet, and she looks back. ]
amy: where did you say your ship was going?
Sawyer: listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
Amy: okay. Okay, fine.
[amy moves to a pylon that has mounted near its bottom a control box. She types in the code 3-8-5-6 and the panel unlocks with a beep, allowing her to pull it upward to open the panel box with a click. She reaches in and pulls something out. ]
sawyer: [whispers] "sonic fence"? Didn't i say let me do the talking?
Juliet: [whispers] one more step, dan would've fried his brain.
Sawyer: his brain's already fried.
Amy: [announcing] okay, it's off.
Sawyer: you first.
[amy proceeds. A high-pitched electrical buzz is heard as she passes between the pylons, but she is otherwise fine. She turns back to the others. ]
amy: see? It's fine.
Sawyer: all right, let's go.
[they all move forward at once. ]
sawyer: and going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'
[a high-pitched electrical buzzing brings jin, sawyer, juliet, miles and daniel fall to their knees, grunting. They writhe on the ground and then go motionless. The buzzing stops, and amy removes a pair of white earplugs from her ears and looks around. ]
[title card: three years later. ]
[1977 - a woman screams in the agony of labor. ]
amy: [screaming] it hurts! Oh!
[a doctor in a lab coat bearing the dharma initiative patch of the staff removes his stethoscope from his ears. ]
doctor: you're gonna be okay, amy. Just try and relax.
[amy inhales and exhales deeply. The doctor steps away, past a nurse carrying a chart, and finds sawyer loitering, pacing amongst the empty hospital beds. This is the medical office at the barracks. ]
doctor: where's horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
Sawyer: he's unavailable.
Doctor: look, amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
Sawyer: what the hell does that mean?
Doctor: it's upside down. She needs a caesarean.
Sawyer: well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
Doctor: i'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
[amy screams a terrible scream. ]
sawyer: can you deliver this baby or not?
Doctor: i don't know.
[sawyer rushes out the door. ]
[outside, sawyer skirts some trees into a garage/depot with fuel containers, oil barrels and tires strewn about. A mechanic works on one of the blue dharma vans. ]
sawyer: [to the mechanic] hey, man. Where is she?
[the mechanic points to the next van over. Sawyer finds a figure in a dark blue jumpsuit working with a whirring grinder underneath a blue dharma van. The grinder saw sparks. Sawyer knocks, and the whirring stops. Juliet wheels herself out from underneath the vehicle. Her jumpsuit's dharma logo patch has a wrench in the middle of it, and her embroidered pocket reads "juliet""motor pool". ]
juliet: what's up?
Sawyer: [lowered voice] amy's having her baby.
Juliet: [taking off her protective goggles] what?
Sawyer: [exasperatedly pulling juliet up] mm. [whispers] did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a caesarean.
[juliet wheels sawyer around, switching positions with him. ]
juliet: [lowered voice] we had an agreement.
Sawyer: screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
Juliet: don't you understand that every time i try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
Sawyer: well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
[juliet throws her work gloves at sawyer and moves off. Sawyer sighs. ]
[back inside the medical office, amy breathes deeply and quickly, while juliet examines her, a hand on her abdomen. Sawyer faces off with the doctor a few paces away. ]
juliet: the baby's breech?
Doctor: yes, but
juliet: did you try an external cephalic version?
Doctor: what? No. I
juliet: it's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutureshalf-round if you've got themand an epidural anesthetic.
Doctor: you're gonna need? Where is horace?
Sawyer: i'm speaking for horace now, and i say she's delivering this baby.
Doctor: i don't think it's a good idea.
Amy: i want her. I want her to do it. Huh? [panting] mm.
Sawyer: you heard the lady.
[the doctor stands down and goes away. Sawyer steps up to juliet. ]
sawyer: listen... You're gonna do great. I know you are.
[juliet brings her focus back to her task. ]
juliet: okay.
Amy: [cries] oh!
[juliet pulls on a stethoscope. ]
juliet: [whispers] okay. Shh.
[amy cries. Sawyer heads outside. ]
juliet: [whispers] hey.
[sawyer paces outside the medical office. A voice interrupts his worrying. It's not quite a voice we've ever heard before. ]
jin: [fluently] is everything okay?
Sawyer: amy went into labor.
Jin: i know. Is she okay?
Sawyer: i don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
Jin: juliet?
Sawyer: yeah, i pulled her out of retirement.
[the men sit down on a bench. ]
sawyer: any luck?
Jin: we finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
Sawyer: well, 1-3-4 then.
Jin: how long do we look, james?
Sawyer: as long as it takes.
[juliet comes out, her face flushed. The men stand up. ]
sawyer: what happened?
Juliet: [sighs] it's a boy.
Sawyer: he's okay? She's okay?
Juliet: [sobbing] everyone's okay. [sighs]
[a proud grin breaks out on sawyer's face, and he looks around, then back at juliet, with a grin. ]
act 4
[1974 - sawyer lays unconscious on a couch. His several days of stubble tell us we're back to the "three years earlier" time period. ]
sawyer: mm.
[sawyer groans, sighs, and grunts awake. He rubs his eyes, lifts his head, and looks up to see horace, mathematician standing over him, leaning against a pool table. They are in the rec room at the barracks. ]
horace: how's your head?
Sawyer: it hurts.
[sawyer sighs, sits up, and looks around. ]
sawyer: where are my people?
Horace: they're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and i really appreciate what you did.
Sawyer: well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
Horace: look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... Why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
Sawyer: my name's james lafleur. You can call me jim.
Horace: how'd you get to the island, jim?
Sawyer: if my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
Horace: they told me i need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
[sawyer looks down, and stands up. ]
sawyer: we got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
[a plate of sandwiches and a glass of milk sit on the pool table. Sawyer helps himself to the glass of milk and sits back down on the couch. ]
horace: what kind of ship?
Sawyer: a salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of portsmouth, england, called the black rock. You heard of her?
Horace: can't say that i have.
[sawyer sips milk. ]
horace: so... Once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
Sawyer: some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
Horace: hmm. Well... [clears throat, removes eyeglasses] i tell you what, jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
Sawyer: send 'em where?
Horace: there's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
[horace turns to leave. ]
sawyer: hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
Horace: nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the dharma initiative. And look, i don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, jim, but you are not dharma material.
[horace leaves. ]
[outside, faraday, miles, juliet and jin sit around a patio table in the barracks compound. Indistinct conversations and laughter of dharma initiative residents surround them. ]
miles: we're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
Juliet: sawyer's gonna be fine.
Miles: what are you lookin' at?
Juliet: i lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
Miles: you were in the dharma initiative?
Juliet: no. The others took over these barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
Miles: well... Welcome home.
Jin: daniel... No more flash?
[we revolve around faraday as he speaks. ]
faraday: no. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
[the voice of a tiny girl attracts the attention first of jin, then of faraday. ]
red-headed girl: [babbling] hey, mum. Where's dad?
[faraday spots a very small red-headed girl in a red dress, dancing and running near an adult companion. ]
woman: [british accent] come on, luv. [speaks indistinctly]
[the tiny red-headed girl appears to wave to daniel. ]
faraday: [whispers] charlotte.
[horace walks up with sawyer. ]
horace: hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, mr. Lafleur here can fill you in on the situation.
[horace departs. ]
miles: "mr. Lafleur"?
Sawyer: it's creole. I improvised.
Juliet: what happened in there?
Sawyer: well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to tahiti.
Miles: how's that bad news?
[suddenly, an alarm blares. All look up. Men and women around them start running with flashlights. ]
woman: you guys, come on! Now!
Man: let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
Man: let's go! Get out of here!
Man: come on! Come on!
[sawyer's group are bewildered by the commotion. A man in a security jumpsuit runs up to them carrying a rifle. It is phil, whom we've seen three years in the future. ]
phil: come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
[as the alarm continues blaring, and indistinct shouts come from all around, phil runs off into the barracks compound, and sawyer's group follow. ]
[juliet bursts through a house door, followed by sawyer, jin, phil, miles, and faraday. A lone woman stands in the kitchen, peering out the window, a rifle lifted and at the ready. ]
phil: heather, keep an eye on them.
[phil leaves and closes the door behind him. The alarm stops. Heather returns her attentions to the kitchen window. Sawyer looks cautiously out the living room window. Juliet comes to the window and looks out as well. In the distance, a man carrying a lighted torch enters the barracks through the tree line. He plants his torch in the grassy lawn and proceeds toward the houses. As he gets closer, juliet makes out who it is: richard alpert. She winces and exhales. She turns toward sawyer and gives a subtle nod, as if to say, "yes, it's one of mine. "]
sawyer: uh-oh.
Act 5
[the barracks, night. Rows of parked bicycles, picket fences, picnic tables, patio furniture, and park benches. A gazebo. An unlit portable grill. No one around. All is still, save a hammock that swings slightly, either from the breeze or from having been just vacated in the alarm. The front door of a yellow house opens, and horace goodspeed peers out. Not far away, richard alpert stands alone under the lamplight, wearing close-cropped hair and a navy blue button-down shirt, looking little different than the last time we saw him 20 years earlier. Horace, hands in the pockets of his jumpsuit, strides out to meet richard. ]
horace: hello, mr. Alpert.
Richard: hello, mr. Goodspeed.
Horace: i wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
Richard: that fence may keep other things out, but not us.
[richard steps in closer. ]
richard: the only thing that does keep us out, horace, is our truce... Which you've now broken.
Horace: i don't know what you're talking about.
Richard: where are my two men?
[miles peers out of the window of the house he and sawyer's group have taken refuge in. He can only hear richard and horace argue indistinctly in the distance, while richard's torch continues to burn further away. Richard raises a finger to horace, and horace raises a hand back in debate. ]
miles: [turning to the group inside] you know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
Sawyer: hold your horses, banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
[horace bursts in through the front door with phil. ]
horace: okay, lafleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
Sawyer: well, that depends on how hard he looks.
[horace sighs and turns back to phil. ]
horace: call the arrow. Tell them we're at condition one. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
Phil: yes, sir.
Sawyer: let me talk to him.
Horace: excuse me?
Sawyer: your buddy out there with the eyelinerlet me talk to him.
Horace: we had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
Sawyer: i understand i'm the one that killed his men, and i'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why i did it.
Horace: [shaking his head] i can't let you do that.
Sawyer: well, it's a good thing i ain't asking your permission.
[sawyer turns past horace and opens the door, but juliet stops him gently. ]
juliet: james, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Sawyer: not yet. [sighs] but i'll figure somethin' out.
[sawyer leaves and closes the door behind him. Outside, sawyer walks up to richard, who is seated on a park bench. ]
sawyer: hello, richard.
Richard: i'm sorry. Do we know each other?
Sawyer: i'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and i defended myself.
Richard: is that so?
Sawyer: that's so.
Richard: your people know that you're telling me this?
Sawyer: they ain't my people, hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
Richard: if you're not a member of the dharma initiative, then what are you?
[sawyer sits down on the bench next to richard. ]
sawyer: did you bury the bomb?
Richard: excuse me?
Sawyer: the hydrogen bomb with "jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
Richard: how...
[richard looks at sawyer interestedly. ]
sawyer: yeah, i know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... He went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is john locke, and i'm waitin' for him to come back. So... You still think i'm a member of the damn dharma initiative?
Richard: no. I guess i don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
[sawyer sighs. ]
richard: now what are we gonna do about that?
[moments later. Paul's dead body, now quite pale, rests on a bed. Horace enters the house with sawyer. Amy holds vigil over paul's body, still looking at him mournfully. ]
horace: how are you doing, amy?
[amy wipes her nose with a tissue. ]
amy: [sighs and sniffles] is he gone?
[she tries to dry her eyes with her hand. ]
amy: alpert?
Horace: no, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
Amy: [alarmed] you told him? Why?
Horace: we had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... Well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take paul's body back with him.
Amy: [gasps] mm. [sighs, gasps] no. Oh!
Horace: hey.
Amy: oh. [cries]
[horace kneels down next to amy. Sawyer sits in the background on a kitchen stool. ]
horace: hey, ames. Listen, w
[she sighs. ]
horace: we've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
[amy looks at sawyer. ]
amy: they can take him. He would want to keep us safe. [sobs] [voice breaks] can i have a minute, please?
[horace gives amy some privacy. Sniffling and sighing, she removes a simple necklace from around paul's necka brown wooden ankh on a black string. She pulls it close to her mouth, cherishing it, then gets up and walks past sawyer. ]
sawyer: i'm sorry.
[amy leaves the house. Horace looks at the body. ]
sawyer: you need some help?
Horace: hmm? Oh. Nah, i've got it. Thanks.
[sawyer turns to leave through the back. ]
horace: hey, jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morningit returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
Sawyer: thanks.
[sawyer walks out. ]
[moments later, sawyer finds juliet looking out over the water on the submarine dock. The galaga is docked there presently. ]
sawyer: i bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, locke'll be back by then.
[sawyer sits down on some crates. ]
juliet: and then what?
Sawyer: what do you mean, "then what"?
Juliet: [turning up to look at him] locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now i've got my chance.
[sawyer looks devastated. ]
juliet: i'm going to leave.
Sawyer: [sighs] you do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... It don't exist yet.
Juliet: [wiping her face] it's not a reason not to go.
Sawyer: well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and mr. "i speak to dead people"?
[juliet smiles. ]
sawyer: and jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
Juliet: [smiling] you'll be fine.
Sawyer: maybe... But who's gonna get my back?
[juliet looks up at him, with a little bit of touched surprise at his sincerity. He disengages with a self-conscious smile and a sigh. ]
sawyer: come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all i'm asking. Two weeks.
Juliet: all right. Two weeks.
[sawyer smiles. So does juliet, looking away. Sawyer looks back out over the water. ]
[title card: three years later]
[1977 - a chessboard, as someone makes a move. It is the barracks on a lovely day. Sawyer strolls down a path past a parked blue bicycle. A blonde woman tosses a volleyball with her young daughter. Turning to a patch of the gardener's handiwork, he spots a common sunflower, dainty and perfect, and picks it, bringing it to his nose for a sniff. He smiles. ]
[a vase of beautiful flowers adorns a tabletop. It is partnered with a bottle of swan-labeled dharma initiative merlot and a big bowl of delicious-looking garden salad. The table is set for dinner. The door opens and sawyer enters the house. ]
sawyer: mmm, somethin' smells good.
Juliet: hey there.
[juliet, wearing an oven mitt, brings a pot of pasta from the stove to the sink for straining. The kitchen counter is covered with carrots, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants, mushrooms, tomatoes, and lettuce. Leaning against one of the pillars, sawyer brings the sunflower into view in front of him. Juliet looks up and notices, smiling. She puts her arms akimbo. ]
juliet: is that for me?
Sawyer: you were amazing today.
[juliet takes the sunflower and puts her arms around him in a big hug. Sawyer chuckles. ]
juliet: thank you for believing in me.
Sawyer: ah.
[her arms still around his neck, juliet looks into sawyer's eyes, and gives him a peck on the mouth. She laughs. ]
sawyer: mm.
[he kisses her deeply. ]
juliet: i love you.
Sawyer: mmm. I love you, too.
[they kiss again. ]
sawyer: mmm.
Juliet: mmm.
Act 6
[his eyeglasses on, sawyer reads a hardback book, sans dust jacket, seated in a comfy chair. He hears the sound of a man stirring awake, and puts the book down. ]
sawyer: wake up, boss.
[horace goodpeed lies on the couch where sawyer had placed him early that morning. He slowly comes to, holding his head. ]
horace: ah. [groans] oh!
Sawyer: how's your head?
Horace: [sitting up] it hurts.
[sawyer puts the book down on the coffee table and removes his glasses. ]
sawyer: i got good news and bad news. What you want first?
Horace: [sighs] good news.
Sawyer: you're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
Horace: oh, gosh. Amy... She had the baby?
Sawyer: [smiling] it's a boy.
Horace: a boy?
Sawyer: mm.
Horace: ohh. [groans]
[horace puts a glass of icewater to his right temple. ]
sawyer: [sighs] now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
Horace: i was, uh... [swallows some icewater] i was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so i went to grab a pair of amy's, and... I found this...
[he produces the ankh necklace from his breast pocket. ]
horace: ... In the back of her drawer. It was paul's.
Sawyer: you got in a fight over a necklace?
Horace: i know. [sighs] but... It's only been three years, jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
[sawyer thinks. ]
sawyer: [sighs] i had a thing for a girl once. And i had a shot at her, but i didn't take it. For a little while, i'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now i can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her faceit's... She's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... Is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
[early morning, in sawyer and juliet's house, the couple lie asleep in bed, tightly spooned together. The telephone rings. Juliet wakens and tugs at sawyer, as if to say, "answer it! "]
sawyer: oh. [grunts]
[the phone keeps ringing. Sawyer, wearing boxers and a wifebeater, crawls over juliet to answer the black rotary phone, grunting, groaning, and sighing as he does so. ]
sawyer: [grunts] what? ... Wait. What? ... Hno. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the north valley.
[he hangs up and jumps out of bed. ]
juliet: who was it?
[sawyer retrieves his glasses from the dresser and snags a jumpsuit from the closet, rattling hangers. He sighs. ]
juliet: james, what's going on?
Sawyer: it was jin.
[sawyer turns to leave. ]
juliet: is everything okay?
[he turns back. ]
sawyer: yeah. I just... I gotta go.
[he does so. ]
[the north valley, as early morning light touches the shoreside meadow. Sawyer drives up in a blue dharma initiative jeep. He parks the jeep and gets out. A blue dharma van drives nearer, then stops. The passenger door opens and hurley steps out, wearing a jeans jacket and carrying a guitar case. Jack steps out of the back in his suit and tie and breathes the island air. Sawyer looks at them in amazement. He removes his eyeglasses as kate steps out from behind hurley, wearing a tank top and black pants. Her facethose freckles. Kate. Sawyer. ]
act 1
[sawyer tugs desperately at the well rope. ]
miles: i think you can let go of that now.
[sawyer looks up and around. The flash has ended. He looks down. The rope dead-ends into solid earth, held up in tension only by sawyer's tugging. Miles, juliet, and jin look on at sawyer, who continues to tug. ]
sawyer: no. No! No!
[sawyer pulls down the length of the rope. ]
sawyer: no! No! No!
Juliet: james, don't.
Sawyer: come on! Help me! [panting]
[juliet kneels down beside sawyer as he claws at the earth around the rope. ]
juliet: james... [whispers] stop.
[he stops and looks up at her. ]
juliet: [normal voice] we can't help him. Wherever john went, he's gone. And wherever we are is before that well was ever built.
Miles: [looking up at the sky] yeah, i'd say way before.
Jin: what makes you
[miles points ahead. Jin looks. Sawyer and juliet get up to look as well. In the distance, not far from them, a colossal stone statue of an animal-headed egyptian deity looks out over the ocean toward the horizon. In its hands, it holds two massive stone ankhs. ]
[meanwhile, at the bottom of the well, locke struggles on the floor of a stone cave-like chamber, injured, in the darkness. He screams. ]
locke: james! Can you hear me? ! Can anyone hear me? !
[locke grabs on to a hold in the stone and pulls himself up, grunting. ]
locke: aah!
[locke staggers through the chamber over to the frozen wheel, where it rattles and creaks, moving by some unseen force behind it. Locke gets a good hold on it, and, with the sound of ice breaking loose and a loud clank, he lifts the wheel up and pulls it back. Green light emanates from behind it. ]
[topside, jin, miles, juliet, and sawyer stand about, and the earth begins to shake. Flashes shoot at them and they grab their heads. And fall to the ground, kneeling, as a buzzing and magnetic humming overtakes all other sound. Down below, a look of surprise comes over locke's face. Up above, the group is totally overcome by the rapid-fire flashes, and they all fall to the ground. White light envelopes everything, and the buzzing and humming stop. Miles holds his head, panting on the ground. Sawyer lifts himself up. ]
juliet: what the hell was that?
Miles: [panting] that one was different. It was... That was more like an earthquake.
[sawyer looks up to see the well has returned. ]
sawyer: [jumping up] locke!
Juliet: [jumping up after him] james, wait!
[sawyer leaps into the well, holding onto the rope. He doesn't get far. The well ends at ground level, blocked up by dirt and stones. ]
sawyer: [sighs] great. [panting]
[sawyer aborts his plan and climbs back out of the well. ]
juliet: my headache is gone.
Miles: yeah, mine is, too.
[miles checks his nose with his hand. ]
miles: and my nose isn't bleeding anymore.
[jin also checks his nose. ]
juliet: i think it's over. I think john did it.
[sawyer looks down the well. They all look around. ]
jin: now what?
Sawyer: now we wait for him to come back.
Juliet: for how long?
[sawyer looks back down the well, and then back up at juliet. ]
sawyer: as long as it takes.
[title card: three years later]
[hands place a tape reel on a reel-to-reel tape machine. Then the pick-up reel. They wrap the tape around the magnetic head, wind the two reels to take up the slack, and press a power button. Then, play. The music wows up to speed. It is tony orlando and dawn's "candida". A man in a dharma initiative jumpsuit with a mustache and sideburns begins gyrating with a cute brunette wearing a tight shirt that reads, in american flag-backed letters, "geronimo jackson". Behind them, a bank of eight black-and-white cathode ray tube monitors display various static outdoor scenes, mostly of zones having sonar fence pylons, and on the control panel underneath the monitor bank, a plate sits stacked with brownies, kept company by a dharma beer. Shelves line the room filled with manuals and tapes. The brunette pulls up the collar of the man's tan jumpsuit. ]
[lyrics: the stars won't come out / if they know that you're around]
phil: are you kidding me?
[a door slams. The man and the brunette turn to see another dharma-jumpsuited man standing at the entrance. ]
phil: i'm gone ten minutes, and you're having a hootenanny?
Jerry: don't be such a bummer, man. Rosie was just droppin' off some brownies. You should thank her. [chuckles]
rosie: yeah.
[phil turns off the reel-to-reel tape machine. The music stops. Jerry and rosie stop dancing. Both men have dharma initiative logo patches with five-pointed stars at the center. Below the patches, on the breast pockets are embroidered their first names and "security". ]
phil: she shouldn't be here, jerry. We're on the clock, man.
Jerry: ah, mellow out, phil. W-what's gonna happen, huh? The polar bears are gonna figure a way out of their cages?
[jerry looks to rosie and chuckles. ]
phil: that's not the point. If lafleur finds out what you're doing here
jerry: lafleur's not gonna find out anything.
[something on the bank of monitors catches rosie's attention, and she leans in for a closer look. ]
phil: it's gonna be my ass, man. I'm the one who's gonna have to answer to him.
Rosie: guys? What...
Jerry: relax, man. Nobody's gonna find out.
[on one of the monitors, a figure stumbles and falls to the ground next to a set of pylons. ]
rosie: guys. What...
[phil and jerry quit bickering and step over to the console. Phil sits down, looking carefully. The figure is hard to make out. ]
phil: is that a hostile?
Jerry: i don't know.
[jerry presses a button marked "overload""push to reset" on an audio monitoring panel. Audio comes over the loudspeakers. The long-haired, staggering figure is panting. ]
rosie: is that... Horace?
[on the monitor, "horace" takes a big swig from a bottle. Phil tugs around his mouth. ]
[outside, at the site of the staggering figure, in the dark of night. It is horace, horace goodspeed, dharma initiative mathematician. Horace sets down the bottle in the grass and reaches into a brown pack. ]
[back in the security station, the trio looks on to see what horace will do next. ]
[back outside, horace chomps on the largest cigar a man could get his lips around, and, humming drunkenly to himself, begins flicking a lighter. Putting the lighter to the end of the cigar]
[on the monitor, in vivid black and white, he removes the cigar from his mouth and its fuse starts flickering. Jerry looks closer. ]
[back outside, horace lobs the giant stogie with a grunt, and it leaves a trace of smoke as it arcs through the air, beyond a sonar fence pylon toward a young tree, which, a second later, explodes loudly. ]
[back in the security station, all three jump back at the noise. ]
jerry: oh, he's got dynamite.
Rosie: aah! [gasps]
phil: get her out of here! Get her out of here now! Now!
Jerry: come on, rosie.
Phil: i told you not to bring her here. I told you!
[jerry rushes an indignant rosie to the door and shoves her out. ]
jerry: you gotta get outta here now. Don't tell anyone you were here. Just go. Go! [turning back to phil] okay, this is bad. This is bad, man.
Phil: we gotta get lafleur.
Jerry: 3:00 in the morning. Do you really wanna wake lafleur up?
Phil: no, of course not, but
jerry: no, no, no. Maybemaybe we can handle this ourselves, huh?
Phil: and maybe horace blows himself up, and lafleur kills us for not waking him.
[they both look over at the bank of monitors just in time to see another explosion. Instantly, they look back at each other, and run for the door. ]
phil: we gotta gonow!
[outside, in the dark, feet beat across the pavement. Jerry and phil run along a cement path through the barracks, stopping at the door of a house. On the porch, jerry doubles over, panting. ]
phil: do you wanna knock?
Jerry: [grunts] you knock.
Phil: fine.
[phil knocks meekly on the door. He looks at jerry and sighs. Then back at the door, and raps a bit harder. A porch light goes on, and an annoyed male voice calls from inside. ]
lafleur: what?
Phil: mr. Lafleur, sorry to bother you, but we got a situation out at the pylons.
[the door swings open. Both men straighten up to attention. ]
lafleur: [clears throat] what kind of situation?
Jerry: uh, it's, uh, horace.
Phil: he's got dynamite, and he's blowing up trees.
[lafleur turns with a sigh. It's sawyer, clean-shaven and with washed hair, wearing a white undershirt. ]
sawyer: son of a bitch.
[he walks back into the house and grabs a jumpsuit similar to the other two men'sdharma logo, 5-pointed star in the middle, and on the pocket, "lafleur""head of security". Sawyer zips up the jumpsuit and joins the two men, who look frightened. The door slams behind them. ]
act 2
[a horn honks impatiently, and miles straume exits a door in the barracks, still pulling on a similar security jumpsuit. He pulls the door behind him and checks the knob. ]
miles: relax! I'm comin'!
[miles runs up to a dharma van and pulls open the passenger side door to join sawyer, who's driving. ]
miles: [sighs] hey, boss.
Sawyer: evening, enos. You got your zapper with ya?
Miles: yep. [sighs] you wanna tell me why i need it?
[sawyer shifts gears and begins driving off. ]
sawyer: [sighs] 'cause our fearless leader is out blowin' up trees.
Miles: why's he doin' that?
Sawyer: [sighs] 'cause he's loaded.
Miles: since when does horace drink?
Sawyer: he doesn't, so we're gonna keep this on the down low.
[the blue dharma van drives off into the night. ]
[horace lies passed out in the grass, snoring, the dharma-brand whiskey bottle still in his right hand. His jumpsuit has an arrow patch on it and reads, "horace""mathematician". A few unexploded sticks of dynamite lay strewn in the grass around him, while what's left of an unfortunate tree burns like a campfire behind him. Footsteps approach from either side. ]
miles: oh, man.
Sawyer: all right. [sighs] you put out that fire. Pack up this dynamite. I'll take him home.
Miles: why don't you put out the fire, pack up, andand i'll take him home?
Sawyer: you wanna tell amy where we found him?
[miles looks groundward. Sawyer smiles. ]
sawyer: help me get him up.
[they tug at both horace's arms, grunting. ]
[sawyer raps on a barracks door, horace slung over his left shoulder. He sighs, and the door opens. It's a woman, in her 30s, with dark red hair, curly. ]
amy: [gasps] oh, my god. Is he okay?
Sawyer: you tell me.
Amy: bring him inside.
[sawyer does. ]
amy: the couch. The couch is fine.
[sawyer grunts. Horace hits the couch like a sack of potatoes. The woman appears to be eight or nine months' pregnant. ]
amy: oh. Where'd you find him?
Sawyer: [catching his breath] by the flame, blowin' up trees with dynamite. Wanna tell me why?
Amy: we had a fight. [sighs]
sawyer: must've been a doozy.
Amy: please, jim. It's personal.
Sawyer: personal? You think this isn't gonna get out? It'll be on the coconut telegraph by breakfast.
Amy: [sighs] it was about paul.
Sawyer: go on.
Amy: [grunts] oh.
[amy holds her belly. ]
sawyer: what's the matter? You okay?
[she falls forward in pain, grasping for sawyer. He gets up and helps her. ]
amy: [groans] ohhh! The babyit's coming. [groans and gasps] ohhh! !
Sawyer: oh, hell.
[title card: three years earlier]
[1974 - sawyer and juliet step out of some foliage to find daniel faraday kneeling alone in the jungle. ]
faraday: [muttering] i'm not gonna tell her. Don't even tell her. I won't.
Sawyer: [lowered voice, to juliet] where's red?
Juliet: i don't know.
[juliet walks over to faraday and stoops down to talk to him. Sawyer, miles and jin hang back. ]
faraday: [mutters indistinctly] no. I won't do it. I won't tell her. I won't do it. Won't...
Juliet: daniel? You okay?
Faraday: i'm not gonna do it. I'm not gonna tell her.
Juliet: daniel, where's charlotte?
Faraday: [voice breaking] she's not here. She... She's gone.
Juliet: where?
Faraday: she's... Dead. She's dead. There was another flash, and... And she was... She was just gone.
[juliet nods sympathetically. ]
faraday: her... Body just... [crying] disappeared. She moved on, and we stayed.
Juliet: i'm so sorry.
Sawyer: hold on. Wait a minute. We "stayed"? We're not traveling through time anymore? You saying it's over?
Faraday: of course it's over. Wherever we are now... Whenever we are now... We're here for good. [to juliet, or perhaps to himself] i won't do it.
Juliet: [whispers] okay. Okay.
Faraday: i won't. I'm not gonnai'mi'm...
Juliet: okay.
Faraday: i'm not gonnai wi won't.
Juliet: okay. Okay.
Faraday: tell...
Sawyer: okay. Swell. Until dan checks back in, i say we head back to the beach. When locke gets back with everybody, that's where they'll be looking for us.
Miles: the beach? What, you didn't get enough flaming arrows shot at you? And your camp is gone. Why bother?
Juliet: sawyer's right, miles. We should go back to the beach. We survived there before. We can do it again.
Miles: [to nobody in particular] or maybe when we get there, you'llyou'll wanna go back to the orchid again. And then when that gets boring, we can head back to the beach. It's the only two plans you people have.
Sawyer: hey, zip it. I'm heading back to the beach. If our stuff's there, great. If not, we build new stuff. You don't like the plan, good luck.
[sawyer tromps off. Juliet looks at miles. ]
miles: who put him in charge?
[juliet follows, and jin goes, too. ]
[a little later, miles leads the way, tossing a stick or bone in his hand. Faraday and jin are not far behind, and juliet and sawyer take up the rear. ]
sawyer: thanks for getting my back for that whole beach issue.
Juliet: you should thank me. It was a stupid idea.
Sawyer: well, what does that say about you agreeing with me?
Juliet: any plan is better than no plan. Besides, if i hadn't agreed with you, we'd still be arguing about where to go next. I just hope you figure out something better before we get there.
Sawyer: well, i'm open to suggestions.
[they hear gunshots and stop in their tracks. Juliet and sawyer raise their rifles, the wwii-era rifles taken from 17-year-old charles widmore and ellie back in 1954. Sawyer begins marching through the foliage in the direction of the gunshots, and jin and juliet go, too, while faraday is more or less catatonic. They hear a woman sobbing in distance. ]
woman: [in distance] oh, no! No, paul! Oh, god! Oh, god!
[sawyer, jin, juliet, and miles run through a clearing. They stop when, from far away, they spot two unkempt-looking men wearing dingy clothes holding a woman at gunpoint in the middle of a meadow of tall grass. She holds her arms up at them as they get closer. ]
woman: no, no, no, no! No, please! We didn't know! Paul, please, please say something.
[she seems to be talking to a man who lies on the ground. Of the two unkempt men, one has a shadow, while the other has a full beard. The one with the shadow takes away the dead man's handgun and stuffs it in the back of his pants, then resumes pointing his own handgun at the woman while the unkempt man with the full beard covers her head with a burlap sack. She falls to her knees. ]
woman: no, no. No, no, no, no, no. We were just touring this park. We didn't mean anything. We were just havingpaul. Paul, please. Oh, my god! No! [sobbing] no, paul, please. Please.
Juliet: who do you think they are?
Miles: who cares who they are? We don't even know when they are. [whispers, to faraday, who sits desolately on the ground behind them] hey. [normal voice] dan. We don't get involved, right? That's what you said.
Faraday: [lucidly] doesn't matter what we do. Whatever happened, happened.
Sawyer: [sternly] yeah, thanks anyway, plato. I'm going over there. [to juliet] you still got my back?
Juliet: absolutely.
Woman: paul, paul. Talk to me! Talk to me, paul!
[but paul is clearly dead, on the ground at the site of a picnic gone wrong: a blanket, plates of sandwiches, a wicker basket with a corked bottle of wine peeking out. ]
beard: on your feet!
Woman: [crying] no, i can't! I can't!
Beard: come on, get up! Now!
Woman: aah!
[the bearded man roughly lifts the woman to her feet. ]
beard: shut up!
Sawyer: [stepping forward] all right, drop the gun!
[shadow whips around and fires his handgun at sawyer. As quickly as he fires, a bullet hole erupts in his chest, and he looks down at it, then falls backward, dead. ]
woman: [screams] oh, god.
[the woman pants and gasps at the commotion, which she is blind to. Sawyer looks down at his rifle. He wasn't the one to have fired. He looks over and sees juliet lower her own rifle from her sight. He looks up to see beard lifting a rifle at him. Sawyer fires, and beard topples backwards, dead. The woman sobs with terror, the bag still over her head. Juliet and sawyer approach and disarm the two dead men. Sawyer removes the bag from her head. ]
sawyer: it's all right. It's okay. You're safe. It's over.
[the woman has red, curly hair. Her name is amy. ]
amy: who are you?
[answerless, sawyer looks at juliet, then back at the woman. ]
act 3
[amy sits wide-legged in the grass next to the dead paul, stroking his hair and his chest. He wears a security jumpsuit similar to those we've seen earlier. Daniel eyes her. Juliet cleans up the picnic while miles patrols with her rifle. ]
juliet: [to sawyer] her friend's wearing a dharma jumpsuit. That puts us in the '70s, '80s.
Sawyer: the guys with the bagsothers?
Juliet: beats me.
Sawyer: what, y'all don't know each other?
Juliet: before my time.
Jin: sawyer. Walkie.
[jin pulls a walkie-talkie off shadow and tosses it to sawyer. Sawyer fiddles with its dial and gets static hisses. ]
juliet: we need to go.
Sawyer: i'm on it.
[sawyer goes over to amy and stoops down to talk to her. ]
sawyer: listen, sweetheart, we gotta get moving now.
Amy: who are you people?
Sawyer: our ship wrecked here on the way to tahiti, but that ain't important right now, 'cause whoever's on the other end of thisthose two might've given 'em a call before we saved you.
Amy: we have to bury them.
Sawyer: bury them? We ain't got time to bury nobody.
Amy: [getting up] wewewe have to. The truce. [rubbing her mouth] oh, god. [sniffles] we have to bury them. Andand we have... [voice breaking] we have... And we have to bring ithim back home. We have to bring paul back with us. Please. Please? [whispers] please.
[she sobs. ]
jin: [stepping forward] i'll carry him.
Sawyer: all right, we'll put these guys in the ground and carry your friend back, but we better do it fast.
Amy: he wasn't... My friend. He was my husband. [sniffles]
[the group hikes down hilly terrain, with steep mountain peaks poking up behind them. Jin carries paul's body over his shoulder. ]
sawyer: [to miles and juliet] all right, listen up. When we get there, there's gonna be a lot of questions. So just keep your mouth shut. Let me do the talking.
Miles: you really think you can convince them that we were in a boat wreck?
Sawyer: i'm a professional. I used to lie for a living.
Juliet: [shouting] daniel! Stop!
[faraday stops, looks up. A row of concrete pylons line the grassy landscape. Each concrete pylon has two copper-green hemispherical caps on its side near its top. Juliet comes forward toward amy, who has also stopped this side of the pylons. ]
juliet: turn it off.
Amy: [looking down, and then up again] turn what off?
Juliet: whatever that is. It looks like some sort of sonic fence or something.
[sawyer looks at juliet, and she looks back. ]
amy: where did you say your ship was going?
Sawyer: listen, sister, we're the ones who just saved your life and hid those bodies. So how about you trust us and turn that damn thing off?
Amy: okay. Okay, fine.
[amy moves to a pylon that has mounted near its bottom a control box. She types in the code 3-8-5-6 and the panel unlocks with a beep, allowing her to pull it upward to open the panel box with a click. She reaches in and pulls something out. ]
sawyer: [whispers] "sonic fence"? Didn't i say let me do the talking?
Juliet: [whispers] one more step, dan would've fried his brain.
Sawyer: his brain's already fried.
Amy: [announcing] okay, it's off.
Sawyer: you first.
[amy proceeds. A high-pitched electrical buzz is heard as she passes between the pylons, but she is otherwise fine. She turns back to the others. ]
amy: see? It's fine.
Sawyer: all right, let's go.
[they all move forward at once. ]
sawyer: and going forward, we should all do a better job of trustin'
[a high-pitched electrical buzzing brings jin, sawyer, juliet, miles and daniel fall to their knees, grunting. They writhe on the ground and then go motionless. The buzzing stops, and amy removes a pair of white earplugs from her ears and looks around. ]
[title card: three years later. ]
[1977 - a woman screams in the agony of labor. ]
amy: [screaming] it hurts! Oh!
[a doctor in a lab coat bearing the dharma initiative patch of the staff removes his stethoscope from his ears. ]
doctor: you're gonna be okay, amy. Just try and relax.
[amy inhales and exhales deeply. The doctor steps away, past a nurse carrying a chart, and finds sawyer loitering, pacing amongst the empty hospital beds. This is the medical office at the barracks. ]
doctor: where's horace? Does he know his wife's in labor?
Sawyer: he's unavailable.
Doctor: look, amy's in a very dangerous situation. The baby's breech.
Sawyer: what the hell does that mean?
Doctor: it's upside down. She needs a caesarean.
Sawyer: well, don't tell me about it. Just do it.
Doctor: i'm an internist, not an obstetrician. Our women always deliver on the mainland. Amy was supposed to get on the sub on tuesday. The baby's two weeks early.
[amy screams a terrible scream. ]
sawyer: can you deliver this baby or not?
Doctor: i don't know.
[sawyer rushes out the door. ]
[outside, sawyer skirts some trees into a garage/depot with fuel containers, oil barrels and tires strewn about. A mechanic works on one of the blue dharma vans. ]
sawyer: [to the mechanic] hey, man. Where is she?
[the mechanic points to the next van over. Sawyer finds a figure in a dark blue jumpsuit working with a whirring grinder underneath a blue dharma van. The grinder saw sparks. Sawyer knocks, and the whirring stops. Juliet wheels herself out from underneath the vehicle. Her jumpsuit's dharma logo patch has a wrench in the middle of it, and her embroidered pocket reads "juliet""motor pool". ]
juliet: what's up?
Sawyer: [lowered voice] amy's having her baby.
Juliet: [taking off her protective goggles] what?
Sawyer: [exasperatedly pulling juliet up] mm. [whispers] did you hear me? She's in trouble. Doc says she needs a caesarean.
[juliet wheels sawyer around, switching positions with him. ]
juliet: [lowered voice] we had an agreement.
Sawyer: screw our agreement. He ain't never done one. I'm guessing you have.
Juliet: don't you understand that every time i try to help a woman on this island give birth, it hasn't worked?
Sawyer: well, maybe whatever made that happen hasn't happened yet. You gotta try. You gotta help her. You're the only one that can.
[juliet throws her work gloves at sawyer and moves off. Sawyer sighs. ]
[back inside the medical office, amy breathes deeply and quickly, while juliet examines her, a hand on her abdomen. Sawyer faces off with the doctor a few paces away. ]
juliet: the baby's breech?
Doctor: yes, but
juliet: did you try an external cephalic version?
Doctor: what? No. I
juliet: it's probably too late. I'm gonna need a number 12 scalpel, 14-gauge sutureshalf-round if you've got themand an epidural anesthetic.
Doctor: you're gonna need? Where is horace?
Sawyer: i'm speaking for horace now, and i say she's delivering this baby.
Doctor: i don't think it's a good idea.
Amy: i want her. I want her to do it. Huh? [panting] mm.
Sawyer: you heard the lady.
[the doctor stands down and goes away. Sawyer steps up to juliet. ]
sawyer: listen... You're gonna do great. I know you are.
[juliet brings her focus back to her task. ]
juliet: okay.
Amy: [cries] oh!
[juliet pulls on a stethoscope. ]
juliet: [whispers] okay. Shh.
[amy cries. Sawyer heads outside. ]
juliet: [whispers] hey.
[sawyer paces outside the medical office. A voice interrupts his worrying. It's not quite a voice we've ever heard before. ]
jin: [fluently] is everything okay?
Sawyer: amy went into labor.
Jin: i know. Is she okay?
Sawyer: i don't know. There's a problem. Juliet's in there.
Jin: juliet?
Sawyer: yeah, i pulled her out of retirement.
[the men sit down on a bench. ]
sawyer: any luck?
Jin: we finished grid 1-3-3 today. No sign of our people. No one.
Sawyer: well, 1-3-4 then.
Jin: how long do we look, james?
Sawyer: as long as it takes.
[juliet comes out, her face flushed. The men stand up. ]
sawyer: what happened?
Juliet: [sighs] it's a boy.
Sawyer: he's okay? She's okay?
Juliet: [sobbing] everyone's okay. [sighs]
[a proud grin breaks out on sawyer's face, and he looks around, then back at juliet, with a grin. ]
act 4
[1974 - sawyer lays unconscious on a couch. His several days of stubble tell us we're back to the "three years earlier" time period. ]
sawyer: mm.
[sawyer groans, sighs, and grunts awake. He rubs his eyes, lifts his head, and looks up to see horace, mathematician standing over him, leaning against a pool table. They are in the rec room at the barracks. ]
horace: how's your head?
Sawyer: it hurts.
[sawyer sighs, sits up, and looks around. ]
sawyer: where are my people?
Horace: they're fine. Amy told me what happened in the jungle, and i really appreciate what you did.
Sawyer: well, y'all got a funny way of showing your appreciation.
Horace: look, we have certain defense protocols. There are hostile indigenous people on this island, and we don't get along with them. So... Why don't you tell me who the hell you are?
Sawyer: my name's james lafleur. You can call me jim.
Horace: how'd you get to the island, jim?
Sawyer: if my friends are safe, why are you asking me all the questions?
Horace: they told me i need to talk to you, that you're the boat captain.
[sawyer looks down, and stands up. ]
sawyer: we got caught in a storm. Our ship wrecked. Must've hit the reef. Thankfully, we washed up on shore.
[a plate of sandwiches and a glass of milk sit on the pool table. Sawyer helps himself to the glass of milk and sits back down on the couch. ]
horace: what kind of ship?
Sawyer: a salvage vessel. Searching for a famous lost wreck. It's an old slaver out of portsmouth, england, called the black rock. You heard of her?
Horace: can't say that i have.
[sawyer sips milk. ]
horace: so... Once you got washed ashore, why were you then wandering around in the jungle?
Sawyer: some of our crew were missin'. We were looking for 'em. That's when we came upon your girl instead.
Horace: hmm. Well... [clears throat, removes eyeglasses] i tell you what, jim. If your crew shows up, we'll send 'em along with ya.
Sawyer: send 'em where?
Horace: there's a submarine that leaves this island first thing in the morning. You and your friends, you're gonna get on it. It's gonna drop you off in tahiti. You can find your way home from there.
[horace turns to leave. ]
sawyer: hold on a minute, chief. We just saved that woman's life. Doesn't that earn us a week or two to find the rest of our people?
Horace: nope. Only people that are allowed to stay on this compound are members of the dharma initiative. And look, i don't want you to take this the wrong way, please, jim, but you are not dharma material.
[horace leaves. ]
[outside, faraday, miles, juliet and jin sit around a patio table in the barracks compound. Indistinct conversations and laughter of dharma initiative residents surround them. ]
miles: we're screwed. He's probably trying to explain time travel by now.
Juliet: sawyer's gonna be fine.
Miles: what are you lookin' at?
Juliet: i lived here for over three years. That was my house over there.
Miles: you were in the dharma initiative?
Juliet: no. The others took over these barracks and wiped out most of the people living in them. They brought me here on a sub a long time after that.
Miles: well... Welcome home.
Jin: daniel... No more flash?
[we revolve around faraday as he speaks. ]
faraday: no. No more flash. The record is spinning again. We're just not on the song we wanna be on.
[the voice of a tiny girl attracts the attention first of jin, then of faraday. ]
red-headed girl: [babbling] hey, mum. Where's dad?
[faraday spots a very small red-headed girl in a red dress, dancing and running near an adult companion. ]
woman: [british accent] come on, luv. [speaks indistinctly]
[the tiny red-headed girl appears to wave to daniel. ]
faraday: [whispers] charlotte.
[horace walks up with sawyer. ]
horace: hello. Somebody will be along shortly to show you to your rooms. In the meantime, mr. Lafleur here can fill you in on the situation.
[horace departs. ]
miles: "mr. Lafleur"?
Sawyer: it's creole. I improvised.
Juliet: what happened in there?
Sawyer: well, he believed my story. But we're gettin' punted. The bastard's puttin' us on their sub tomorrow and shipping us off to tahiti.
Miles: how's that bad news?
[suddenly, an alarm blares. All look up. Men and women around them start running with flashlights. ]
woman: you guys, come on! Now!
Man: let's go! Get in! Get in! Get in! Move!
Man: let's go! Get out of here!
Man: come on! Come on!
[sawyer's group are bewildered by the commotion. A man in a security jumpsuit runs up to them carrying a rifle. It is phil, whom we've seen three years in the future. ]
phil: come on! Get inside! Move! Now!
[as the alarm continues blaring, and indistinct shouts come from all around, phil runs off into the barracks compound, and sawyer's group follow. ]
[juliet bursts through a house door, followed by sawyer, jin, phil, miles, and faraday. A lone woman stands in the kitchen, peering out the window, a rifle lifted and at the ready. ]
phil: heather, keep an eye on them.
[phil leaves and closes the door behind him. The alarm stops. Heather returns her attentions to the kitchen window. Sawyer looks cautiously out the living room window. Juliet comes to the window and looks out as well. In the distance, a man carrying a lighted torch enters the barracks through the tree line. He plants his torch in the grassy lawn and proceeds toward the houses. As he gets closer, juliet makes out who it is: richard alpert. She winces and exhales. She turns toward sawyer and gives a subtle nod, as if to say, "yes, it's one of mine. "]
sawyer: uh-oh.
Act 5
[the barracks, night. Rows of parked bicycles, picket fences, picnic tables, patio furniture, and park benches. A gazebo. An unlit portable grill. No one around. All is still, save a hammock that swings slightly, either from the breeze or from having been just vacated in the alarm. The front door of a yellow house opens, and horace goodspeed peers out. Not far away, richard alpert stands alone under the lamplight, wearing close-cropped hair and a navy blue button-down shirt, looking little different than the last time we saw him 20 years earlier. Horace, hands in the pockets of his jumpsuit, strides out to meet richard. ]
horace: hello, mr. Alpert.
Richard: hello, mr. Goodspeed.
Horace: i wish you would've told me you were coming. I would've turned the fence off for you.
Richard: that fence may keep other things out, but not us.
[richard steps in closer. ]
richard: the only thing that does keep us out, horace, is our truce... Which you've now broken.
Horace: i don't know what you're talking about.
Richard: where are my two men?
[miles peers out of the window of the house he and sawyer's group have taken refuge in. He can only hear richard and horace argue indistinctly in the distance, while richard's torch continues to burn further away. Richard raises a finger to horace, and horace raises a hand back in debate. ]
miles: [turning to the group inside] you know what? Gettin' on that sub is starting to sound like a great idea. What do you say? Sub, anyone?
Sawyer: hold your horses, banzai. No one's gettin' on a sub.
[horace bursts in through the front door with phil. ]
horace: okay, lafleur, how well'd you bury those bodies?
Sawyer: well, that depends on how hard he looks.
[horace sighs and turns back to phil. ]
horace: call the arrow. Tell them we're at condition one. Take the heavy ordnance, and make sure the fence is at maximum.
Phil: yes, sir.
Sawyer: let me talk to him.
Horace: excuse me?
Sawyer: your buddy out there with the eyelinerlet me talk to him.
Horace: we had a truce with these people. You don't understand.
Sawyer: i understand i'm the one that killed his men, and i'm the one that's gonna go out there and tell him why i did it.
Horace: [shaking his head] i can't let you do that.
Sawyer: well, it's a good thing i ain't asking your permission.
[sawyer turns past horace and opens the door, but juliet stops him gently. ]
juliet: james, are you sure you know what you're doing?
Sawyer: not yet. [sighs] but i'll figure somethin' out.
[sawyer leaves and closes the door behind him. Outside, sawyer walks up to richard, who is seated on a park bench. ]
sawyer: hello, richard.
Richard: i'm sorry. Do we know each other?
Sawyer: i'm the guy that killed your men. Heard some gunshots, saw two men throwing a bag over a woman's head. Gave 'em a chance to throw the weapons down and walk away, but one of them took a shot at me, and i defended myself.
Richard: is that so?
Sawyer: that's so.
Richard: your people know that you're telling me this?
Sawyer: they ain't my people, hoss. So if you got some kind of a truce with them, it ain't been broken.
Richard: if you're not a member of the dharma initiative, then what are you?
[sawyer sits down on the bench next to richard. ]
sawyer: did you bury the bomb?
Richard: excuse me?
Sawyer: the hydrogen bomb with "jughead" written on the side. Did you bury it?
Richard: how...
[richard looks at sawyer interestedly. ]
sawyer: yeah, i know about it. I also know that 20 years ago, some bald fella limped into your camp and fed you some mumbo jumbo about being your leader. And then poof... He went and disappeared right in front of ya. Any of this ringin' a bell? That man's name is john locke, and i'm waitin' for him to come back. So... You still think i'm a member of the damn dharma initiative?
Richard: no. I guess i don't. But no matter who you are, two of my men are dead. And my people need some kind of justice.
[sawyer sighs. ]
richard: now what are we gonna do about that?
[moments later. Paul's dead body, now quite pale, rests on a bed. Horace enters the house with sawyer. Amy holds vigil over paul's body, still looking at him mournfully. ]
horace: how are you doing, amy?
[amy wipes her nose with a tissue. ]
amy: [sighs and sniffles] is he gone?
[she tries to dry her eyes with her hand. ]
amy: alpert?
Horace: no, he's not gone. We told him where the bodies were.
Amy: [alarmed] you told him? Why?
Horace: we had to. It was the only way to maintain the truce. Jim here worked it out with him, but... Well, he's gonna need something from us now. He needs to take paul's body back with him.
Amy: [gasps] mm. [sighs, gasps] no. Oh!
Horace: hey.
Amy: oh. [cries]
[horace kneels down next to amy. Sawyer sits in the background on a kitchen stool. ]
horace: hey, ames. Listen, w
[she sighs. ]
horace: we've been friends for a long time, yeah? So this is completely your choice. If you don't want to give him to them, then we will suffer the consequences.
[amy looks at sawyer. ]
amy: they can take him. He would want to keep us safe. [sobs] [voice breaks] can i have a minute, please?
[horace gives amy some privacy. Sniffling and sighing, she removes a simple necklace from around paul's necka brown wooden ankh on a black string. She pulls it close to her mouth, cherishing it, then gets up and walks past sawyer. ]
sawyer: i'm sorry.
[amy leaves the house. Horace looks at the body. ]
sawyer: you need some help?
Horace: hmm? Oh. Nah, i've got it. Thanks.
[sawyer turns to leave through the back. ]
horace: hey, jim, the sub leaving tomorrow morningit returns in two weeks. Until then, you can stay and look for the rest of your crew.
Sawyer: thanks.
[sawyer walks out. ]
[moments later, sawyer finds juliet looking out over the water on the submarine dock. The galaga is docked there presently. ]
sawyer: i bought us two weeks. Horace said we can wait for the next sub. Any luck, locke'll be back by then.
[sawyer sits down on some crates. ]
juliet: and then what?
Sawyer: what do you mean, "then what"?
Juliet: [turning up to look at him] locke said he was leaving to save us. The flashes have stopped. They're over. No more bloody noses. We're already saved. That sub behind you brought me here. I've been trying to get off of this island for more than three years, and now i've got my chance.
[sawyer looks devastated. ]
juliet: i'm going to leave.
Sawyer: [sighs] you do realize it's 1974, that whatever it is you think you're going back to... It don't exist yet.
Juliet: [wiping her face] it's not a reason not to go.
Sawyer: well, what about me? You really gonna leave me here with the mad scientist and mr. "i speak to dead people"?
[juliet smiles. ]
sawyer: and jin, who's a hell of a nice guy but not exactly the greatest conversationalist.
Juliet: [smiling] you'll be fine.
Sawyer: maybe... But who's gonna get my back?
[juliet looks up at him, with a little bit of touched surprise at his sincerity. He disengages with a self-conscious smile and a sigh. ]
sawyer: come on. Just give me two weeks, that's all i'm asking. Two weeks.
Juliet: all right. Two weeks.
[sawyer smiles. So does juliet, looking away. Sawyer looks back out over the water. ]
[title card: three years later]
[1977 - a chessboard, as someone makes a move. It is the barracks on a lovely day. Sawyer strolls down a path past a parked blue bicycle. A blonde woman tosses a volleyball with her young daughter. Turning to a patch of the gardener's handiwork, he spots a common sunflower, dainty and perfect, and picks it, bringing it to his nose for a sniff. He smiles. ]
[a vase of beautiful flowers adorns a tabletop. It is partnered with a bottle of swan-labeled dharma initiative merlot and a big bowl of delicious-looking garden salad. The table is set for dinner. The door opens and sawyer enters the house. ]
sawyer: mmm, somethin' smells good.
Juliet: hey there.
[juliet, wearing an oven mitt, brings a pot of pasta from the stove to the sink for straining. The kitchen counter is covered with carrots, peppers, cucumbers, eggplants, mushrooms, tomatoes, and lettuce. Leaning against one of the pillars, sawyer brings the sunflower into view in front of him. Juliet looks up and notices, smiling. She puts her arms akimbo. ]
juliet: is that for me?
Sawyer: you were amazing today.
[juliet takes the sunflower and puts her arms around him in a big hug. Sawyer chuckles. ]
juliet: thank you for believing in me.
Sawyer: ah.
[her arms still around his neck, juliet looks into sawyer's eyes, and gives him a peck on the mouth. She laughs. ]
sawyer: mm.
[he kisses her deeply. ]
juliet: i love you.
Sawyer: mmm. I love you, too.
[they kiss again. ]
sawyer: mmm.
Juliet: mmm.
Act 6
[his eyeglasses on, sawyer reads a hardback book, sans dust jacket, seated in a comfy chair. He hears the sound of a man stirring awake, and puts the book down. ]
sawyer: wake up, boss.
[horace goodpeed lies on the couch where sawyer had placed him early that morning. He slowly comes to, holding his head. ]
horace: ah. [groans] oh!
Sawyer: how's your head?
Horace: [sitting up] it hurts.
[sawyer puts the book down on the coffee table and removes his glasses. ]
sawyer: i got good news and bad news. What you want first?
Horace: [sighs] good news.
Sawyer: you're a daddy. Bad news is you missed it.
Horace: oh, gosh. Amy... She had the baby?
Sawyer: [smiling] it's a boy.
Horace: a boy?
Sawyer: mm.
Horace: ohh. [groans]
[horace puts a glass of icewater to his right temple. ]
sawyer: [sighs] now how about you tell me why you're too busy drinkin' and blowin' up trees to see him get born?
Horace: i was, uh... [swallows some icewater] i was looking for a pair of socks, and all of mine were dirty, so i went to grab a pair of amy's, and... I found this...
[he produces the ankh necklace from his breast pocket. ]
horace: ... In the back of her drawer. It was paul's.
Sawyer: you got in a fight over a necklace?
Horace: i know. [sighs] but... It's only been three years, jim. Just three years that he's been gone. Is that really long enough to get over someone?
[sawyer thinks. ]
sawyer: [sighs] i had a thing for a girl once. And i had a shot at her, but i didn't take it. For a little while, i'd lay in bed every night, wondering if it was a mistake. Wondering if... I'd ever stop thinking about her. And now i can barely even remember what she looks like. I mean, her faceit's... She's just gone. And she ain't never coming back. So... Is three years long enough to get over someone? Absolutely.
[early morning, in sawyer and juliet's house, the couple lie asleep in bed, tightly spooned together. The telephone rings. Juliet wakens and tugs at sawyer, as if to say, "answer it! "]
sawyer: oh. [grunts]
[the phone keeps ringing. Sawyer, wearing boxers and a wifebeater, crawls over juliet to answer the black rotary phone, grunting, groaning, and sighing as he does so. ]
sawyer: [grunts] what? ... Wait. What? ... Hno. No. Don't bring 'em in. Just meet me in the north valley.
[he hangs up and jumps out of bed. ]
juliet: who was it?
[sawyer retrieves his glasses from the dresser and snags a jumpsuit from the closet, rattling hangers. He sighs. ]
juliet: james, what's going on?
Sawyer: it was jin.
[sawyer turns to leave. ]
juliet: is everything okay?
[he turns back. ]
sawyer: yeah. I just... I gotta go.
[he does so. ]
[the north valley, as early morning light touches the shoreside meadow. Sawyer drives up in a blue dharma initiative jeep. He parks the jeep and gets out. A blue dharma van drives nearer, then stops. The passenger door opens and hurley steps out, wearing a jeans jacket and carrying a guitar case. Jack steps out of the back in his suit and tie and breathes the island air. Sawyer looks at them in amazement. He removes his eyeglasses as kate steps out from behind hurley, wearing a tank top and black pants. Her facethose freckles. Kate. Sawyer. ]
