What dyou expect Theyre savages One lot steals a goat from another lot and before you know it theyre ripping each other to pieces
Ive never seen wildlings do a thing like this Ive never seen a thing like this not ever in my life
How close did you get
Close as any man would
We should head back to the wall
Do the dead frighten you
Our orders were to track the wildlings We tracked them They wont trouble us no more
You dont think hell ask us how they died Get back on your horse
Whatever did it to them could do it to us They even killed the children
Its a good thing were not children You want to run away south run away Of course they will behead you as a deserter If I dont catch you first Get back on your horse I wont say it again
Your dead men seem to have moved camp
They were here
See where they went
What is it
Its
Go on Fathers watching
And your mother
Fine work as always Well done
Thank you
I love the detail that youve managed to get in this corners Quite beautiful the stitching
And which one of you was a marksman at ten Keep practicing Bran Go on
Dont think too much Bran
Relax your bow arm JON
Quick Bran faster
Lord Stark My lady A guardsman just rode in from the hills Theyve captured a deserter from the Nights Watch
Get the lads to saddle their horses
Do you have to
He swore an oath Cat
The law is law my lady
Tell Bran hes coming too
Ned Ten is too young to see such things
He wont be a boy forever And winter is coming
Lad go run back and get the rest
White Walkers I saw the White Walkers White Walkers The White Walkers I saw them
I know I broke my oath And I know Im a deserter I should have gone back to the Wall and warned them But I saw what I saw I saw the White Walkers People need to know If you can get word to my family tell them Im no coward Tell them Im sorry
Forgive me lord
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon first of his name
Dont look away
King of the Andals and the First Men
Father will know if you do
Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and protector of the realm I Eddard of the House Stark Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North sentence you to die
You did well
You understand why I did it
Jon said he was a deserter
But do you understand why I had to kill him
Our way is the old way
The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword
Is it true he saw the White Walkers
The White Walkers have been gone for thousands of years
So he was lying
A madman sees what he sees
What is it
Mountain lion
There are no mountain lions in these woods
Its a freak
Its a direwolf
Tough old beast
There are no direwolves south of the Wall
Now there are five
You want to hold it
Where will they go Their mothers dead
They dont belong down here
Better a quick death They wont last without their mother
Right Give it here
NO
Put away your blade
I take orders from your father not you
Please father
Im sorry Bran
Lord Stark There are five pups One for each of the Stark children The direwolf is the sigil of your House They were meant to have them
You will train them yourselves You will feed them yourselves And if they die you will bury them yourselves
What about you
Im not a Stark Get on
What is it
The runt of the litter That ones yours Snow
As your brother I feel its my duty to warn you You worry too much Its starting to show
And you never worry about anything When we were seven you jumped off the cliffs as Casterly Rock One hundred foot drop into the water And you were never afraid
There was nothing to be afraid of until you told father Were Lannisters Lannisters dont act like fools
What if Jon Arryn told someone
But who would he tell
My husband
If he told the king both our heads would be skewered on the city gates by now Whatever Jon Arryn knew or didnt know it died with him And Robert will choose a new Hand of the king someone to do his job while hes off fucking boars and hunting whores Or is it the other way around And life will go on
You should be the Hand of the king
Thats an honor I can do without Their days are too long their lives are too short
All these years and I still feel like an outsider when I come here
You have five northern children Youre not an outsider
I wonder if the old gods agree
Its your gods with all the rules
I am so sorry my love
Tell me
There was a raven from Kings Landing Jon Arryn is dead A fever took him I know he was like a father to you
Your sister The boy
They both have their health Gods be good The raven brought more news The king rides for Winterfell With the queen and all the rest of them
Hes coming this far North theres only one thing hes after
You can always say no Ned
We need plenty of candles for Lord Tyrions chamber Im told he reads all night
Im told he drinks all night
How much could he possibly drink A man of his stature
Weve brought up eight barrels of ale from the cellar Perhaps well find out
In any case candles
Whys your mother so deadset on us getting pretty for the king
Its for the queen I bet I hear she
I hear the prince is a right royal prick
Think of all those southern girls he gets to stab with his right royal prick
Go on Tommy shave him good Hes never met a girl he likes better than his own hair
Gods but they grow fast Brandon
I saw the king Hes got hundreds of people
How many times have I told you No climbing
But hes coming right now Down our road
I want you to promise me No more climbing
I promise
Dyou know what
What
You always look at your feet before you lie Run and find your father Tell him the king is close
Wheres Arya Sansa wheres your sister

Tell me about Jon Arryn
One minute he was fine and then Burned right through him whatever it was I loved that man
We both did
He never had to teach you much but me You remember me at 16 All I wanted to do was crack skulls and fuck girls He showed me what was what
Aye
Dont look at me like that Not his fault I didnt listen I need you Ned Down at Kings Landing Not up here where youre no damn use to anybody Lord Eddard Stark I would name you the Hand of the king
Im not worthy of the honor
Im not trying to honor you Im trying to get you to run my kingdom while I eat drink and whore my way to an early grave Damn it Ned stand up You helped me win the Iron Throne now help me keep the damn thing We were meant to rule together If your sister had lived we would have been bound by blood Well its not too late I have a son you have a daughter Well join our Houses
Mmh It is true what they say about the Northern girls
Did you hear the kings in Winterfell
I did hear something about that
And the queen And her twin brother They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms
And the other brother
The queen has two brothers
Theres the pretty one And theres the clever one
I hear they call him the Imp
I hear he hates that nickname
Oh I hear hes more than earned it I hear hes a drunken little lecher into all manner of perversions
Clever girl
Weve been expecting you Lord Tyrion
Have you
The gods gave me one blessing
Dont get up
Mlord
Should I explain to you the meaning of a closed door in a whorehouse brother
Youve much to teach me no doubt But our sister craves your attention
She has odd cravings our sister
A family trait Now the Starks are feasting us at sundown Dont leave me alone with these people
Im sorry Ive begun the feast a bit early And this is the first of many courses
I thought you might say that But since were short on time Come on girls See you at sundown
Close the doorScene changes to the Winterfell crypt at Lyannas tomb
Did you have to bury her in a place like this She should be on a hill somewhere with the sun and the clouds above her
She was my sister This is where she belongs
She belonged with me
In my dreams I kill him every night
Its done Your Grace The Targaryens are gone
Not all of them
Daenerys
Daenerys Theres our bride to be Look  a gift from Illyrio Touch it Come on Feel the fabric Mmmm Isnt he a gracious host
Weve been his guests for over a year and hes never asked us for anything
Illyrio is no fool He knows I wont forget my friends when I come into my throne You still slouch Let me see You have a womans body now I need you to be perfect today Can you do that for me You dont want to wake the dragon do you
No
When they write the history of my reign sweet sister they will say it began today
Its too hot my lady
Where is he
The Dothraki are not known for their punctuality
May I present my honored guests Viserys of House Targaryen the third of his name The rightful King of the Andals and the First Men And his sister Daenerys of the House Targaryen
Do you see how long his hair is When Dothraki are defeated in combat they cut off their braid so the whole world can see their shame Khal Drogo has never been defeated Hes a savage of course but hes one of the finest killers alive And you will be his queen
Come forward my dear
Wheres he going
The ceremony is over
But he didnt say anything Did he like her
Trust me Your Grace If he didnt like her wed know
It wont be long now Soon you will cross the Narrow Sea and take back your fathers throne The people drink secret toasts to your health They cry out for their true king
When will they be married
Soon The Dothraki never stay still for long
Is it true they lie with their horses
I wouldnt ask Khal Drogo
Do you take me for a fool
I take you for a king Kings lack the caution of common men My apologies if Ive given offense
I know how to play a man like Drogo I give him a queen and he gives me an army DAENERYS I dont want to be his queen I want to go home
So do I I want us both to go home But they took it from us So tell me sweet sister how do we go home
I dont know
We go home with an army With Khal Drogos army I would let his whole tribe fuck you all 40000 men and their horses too if thats what it took
Do you think Joffrey will like me What if he thinks Im ugly
Then he is the stupidest prince that ever lived
Hes so handsome
When would we be married Soon or do we have to wait
Hush now Your father hasnt even said yes
Why would he say no Hed be the second most powerful man in the kingdoms
Hed have to leave home Hed have to leave me And so would you
You left your home to come here And Id be queen someday Please make father say yes
Sansa
Please please Its the only thing I ever wanted
Is he dead yet
Uncle Benjen
You got bigger I rode all day Didnt want to leave you alone with the Lannisters Why arent you at the feast
Lady Stark thought it might insult the royal family to seat a bastard in their midst
Well youre always welcome on the wall No bastard was ever refused a seat there
So take me with you when you go back
Jon
Father will let me if you ask him I know he will
The Wall isnt going anywhere
Im ready to swear your oath
You dont understand what youd be giving up We have no families None of us will ever father sons
I dont care about that
You might if you knew what it meant Id better get inside Rescue your father from his guests Well talk later
Your uncles in the Nights Watch
Whatre you doing back there
Preparing for a night with your family Ive always wanted to see the Wall
Youre Tyrion Lannister The queens brother
My greatest accomplishment You  youre Ned Starks bastard arent you
Did I offend you Sorry You are the bastard though
Lord Eddard Stark is my father
And Lady Stark is not your mother Making you a bastard Let me give you some advice bastard Never forget what you are The rest of the world will not Wear it like armor Then it can never be used to hurt you
What the hell do you know about being a bastard
All dwarves are bastards in their fathers eyes
You at a feast Its like a bear in a trap
The boy I beheaded Did you know him
Of course I did Just a lad But he was tough Ned A true Ranger
He was talking madness Said the Walkers slaughtered his friends
The two he was with are still missing
A wildling ambush
Maybe Direwolves south of the wall Talk of the Walkers My brother might be the next Hand to the king Winter is coming
Winter is coming
Uncle Benjen
Robb boy How are ye
Im good CATELYN Is this your first time in the North Your Grace
Yes Lovely country
Im sure its very grim after Kings Landing I remember how scared I was when Ned brought me up here for the first time
Hello little dove But you are a beauty How old are you
Thirteen Your Grace
Youre tall Still growing
I think so Your Grace
And have you bled yet
No Your Grace
And your dress Did you make it
Such talent You must make something for me
I hear we might share a grandchild someday
I hear the same
Your daughter will do well in the capital Such a beauty shouldnt stay hidden up here forever
Your pardon
I hear we might be neighbors soon I hope its true
Yes the king has honored me with his offer
Im sure well have a tournament to celebrate the new title if you accept It would be good to have you in the field The competition has become a bit stale
I dont fight in tournaments
No Getting a little old for it
I dont fight in tournaments because when I fight a man for real I dont want him to know what I can do
Well said
Arya
Time for bed
Im a Northman I belong here with you not down south in that rats nest they call a capital
I wont let him take you
The king takes what he wants Thats why hes king
Ill say Listen fat man you are not taking my husband anywhere He belongs to me now
How did he get so fat
He only stops eating when its time for a drink
Its Maester Luwin my lord
Send him in
Pardon my lord my lady A rider in the night from your sister
Stay
This was sent from the Eyrie Whats she doing at the Eyrie She hasnt been back there since her wedding
What news
Shes fled the capital She says Jon Arryn was murdered By the Lannisters She says the king is in danger
Shes fresh widowed Cat She doesnt know what shes saying
Lysas head would be on a spike right now if the wrong people had found that letter Do you think she would risk her life her sons life if she wasnt certain her husband was murdered
If this news is true and the Lannisters conspire against the throne who but you can protect the king
They murdered the last Hand Now you want Ned to take the job
The king rode for a month to ask Lord Starks help Hes the only one he trusts You swore the king an oath my lord
He spent half his life fighting Roberts wars He owes him nothing Your father and brother rode south once on a kings demand
A different time Different king
When do I meet with the Khal We need to begin planning the invasion
If Khal Drogo has promised you a crown you shall have it
When
When their omens favor war
I piss on Dothraki omens I waited 17 years to get my throne back
A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is considered a dull affair
A small gift for the new Khaleesi Songs and histories from the Seven Kingdoms
Thank you ser Are you from my country
Ser Jorah Mormont of Bear Island I served your father for many years Gods be good I hope to always serve the rightful king
Dragons eggs Daenerys From the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai The ages have turned them to stone but they will always be beautiful
Thank you Magister
Shes beautiful Ser Jorah I dont know how to say thank you in Dothraki
There is no word for thank you in Dothraki
Make him happy
No
Do you know the Common Tongue
No
Is no the only word that you know
No
Rough night Imp
If I get through this without squirting from one end or the other it will be a miracle
I didnt pick you for a hunter
The greatest in the land My spear never misses
Its not hunting if you pay for it
Are you as good with a spear as you used to be
No but Im still better than you
I know what Im putting you through Thank you for saying yes I only ask you because I need you Youre a loyal friend You hear me A loyal friend The last one Ive got
I hope Ill serve you well
You will And Ill make sure you dont look so fucking grim all the time Come on boys lets go kill some boar
Come on you
Stop STOP
Are you completely mad
He saw us
Its all right Its all right
He saw us
I heard you the first time Quite the little climber arent you How old are you boy
Ten
Ten
The things I do for love BLACKOUT
You need to drink child And eat
Isnt there anything else
The Dothraki have two things in abundance grass and horses People cant live on grass In the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai they say there are fields of ghost grass with stalks as pale as milk that glow in the night It murders all other grass The Dothraki believe that one day it will cover everything Thats the way the world will end Itll get easier
Khaleesi
Your hands
Were still not far from Pentos your Grace Magister Illyrio has extended his hospitality Youd be more comfortable there
I have no interest in hospitality or comfort Ill stay with Drogo until he fulfils his end of the bargain and I have my crown
As you wish your Grace
Well Mormont as brutish as this life is I suppose it is preferable to beheading What did Ned Stark want you for Buying from a slaver
Selling to one Some poachers I caught on my land
Under my reign you wont be punished for such nonsense You can rest assured of that 
Betterlooking bitches than youre used to Uncle My mothers been looking for you We ride for Kings Landing today
Before you go you will call on Lord and Lady Stark and offer your sympathies
What good will my sympathies do them
None But it is expected of you Your absence has already been noted
The boy means nothing to me And I cant stand the wailing of women
One word and Ill hit you again
Im telling mother
Go Tell her But first you will get to Lord and Lady Stark and you will fall on your knees in front of them and tell them how very sorry you are that you are at their service and that all your prayers are with them Do you understand
You cant
Do you understand
The Prince will remember that little lord
I hope so If he forgets be a good dog and remind him Time for breakfast
Bread And two of those little fish And a mug of dark beer to wash it down And bacon burnt black
Little brother
Beloved siblings
Is Bran going to die
Apparently not
What do you mean
The Maester says the boy may live
Its no mercy letting a child linger in such pain
Only the gods know for certain All the rest of us can do is pray The charms of the north seem entirely lost on you
I still cant believe youre going Its ridiculous even for you
Wheres your sense of wonder The greatest structure ever built the intrepid men of the Nights Watch the wintry abode of the White Walkers
Tell me youre not thinking of taking the black
And go celibate The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world
The children dont need to hear your filth Come
Even if the boy lives hell be a cripple a grotesque Give me a good clean death any day
Speaking for the grotesques Id have to disagree Death is so final whereas life Life is full of possibilities I hope the boy does wake Id be very interested to hear what he has to say
My dear brother there are times you make me wonder whose side youre on
My dear brother you wound me You know how much I love my family 
Please
I would have dressed your Grace
This is your home Im your guest Handsome one isnt he I lost my first boy a little blackhaired beauty He was a fighter too Tried to beat the fever that took him Forgive me Its the last thing you need to hear right now
I never knew
It was years ago Robert was crazed beat his hands bloody on the wall all the things men do to show you how much they care The boy looked just like him Such a little thing A bird without feathers They came to take his body away and Robert held me I screamed and I battled but he held me That little bundle They took him away and I never saw him again Never have visited the crypt never I pray to the Mother every morning and night that she return your child to you
I am grateful
Perhaps this time shell listen 
A sword for the wall
I already have one
Good man Have you swung it yet
Of course I have
At someone I mean Its a strange thing the first time you cut a man You realize were nothing but sacks of meat and blood and some bone to keep it all standing Let me thank you ahead of time for guarding us all from the perils beyond the Wall Wildlings and White Walkers and whatnot Were grateful to have good strong men like you protecting us
Weve guarded the Kingdoms for 8 000 years
Is it we already Have you taken your vows then
Soon enough
Give my regards to the Nights Watch Im sure it will be thrilling to serve in such an elite force And if not Its only for life 
Thank you Nymeria Septa Mordane says I have to do it again My things werent properly folded  she says Who cares how theyre folded Theyre going to get all messed up anyway
Its good youve got help
Watch Nymeria gloves
Impressive
Shut up Nymeria gloves
I have something for you And it has to be packed very carefully
A present
Close the door This is no toy Be careful you dont cut yourself
Its so skinny
So are you I had the blacksmith make it for you special It wont hack a mans head off but it can poke him full of holes if youre quick enough
I can be quick
Youll have to work at it every day How does it feel Do you like the balance
I think so
First lesson Stick them with the pointy end
I know which end to use
Im going to miss you Careful All the best swords have names you know
Sansa can keep her sewing needles Ive got a needle of my own 
I came to say goodbye to Bran
Youve said it
I wish I could be here when you wake up Im going north with Uncle Benjen Im taking the black I know we always talked about seeing the Wall together but youll be able to come visit me at Castle Black when youre better Ill know my way around by then Ill be a sworn brother of the Nights Watch We can go out walking beyond the Wall if youre not afraid
I want you to leave
17 years ago you rode off with Robert Baratheon You came back a year later with another womans son And now youre leaving again
I have no choice
Thats what men always say when honor calls Thats what you tell your families tell yourselves You do have a choice And youve made it I cant do it Ned I really cant
You can You must 
Youve said goodbye to Bran Hes not going to die I know it
You Starks are hard to kill
My mother
She was very kind
Good Next time I see you youll be all in black
It was always my color
Farewell Snow
And you Stark 
Theres great honor serving in the Nights Watch The Starks have manned the Wall for thousands of years And you are a Stark You might not have my name but you have my blood
Is my mother alive Does she know about me Where I am where Im going Does she care
The next time we see each other well talk about your mother I promise 
Gods this is country Ive half a mind to leave them all behind and keep going
Ive half a mind to go with you
What do you say just you and me on the Kingsroad swords at our sides a couple of tavern wenches to warm our beds tonight
You should have asked me 20 years ago
There were wars to fight women to marry We never had the chance to be young
I recall a few chances
There was that one Oh what was her name That common girl of yours Becca With the great big tits you could bury your face in
Bessie She was one of yours
Bessie Thank the gods for Bessie and her tits Yours was Aleena No You told me once Meryl Your bastards mother
Wylla
Thats it She must have been a rare wench to make Lord forget his honor You never told me what she looked like
Nor will I
We were at war None of us knew if we were gonna go back home again Youre too hard on yourself You always have been I swear if I werent your King youd have hit me already
The worst thing about your coronation Ill never get to hit you again
Trust me thats not the worst thing There was a rider in the night
Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord What of it Should we send her a wedding gift
A knife perhaps a good sharp one and a bold man to wield it
Shes little more than a child
Soon enough that child will spread her legs and start breeding
Tell me were not speaking of this
Oh its unspeakable to you What her father did to your family That was unspeakable What Rhaegar Targaryen did to your sister the woman I loved Ill kill every Targaryen I get my hands on
But you cant get your hands on this one can you
This Khal Drogo its said he has 100000 men in his horde
Even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm as long as they remain on the other side of the Narrow Sea They have no ships Robert
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper If the Targaryen boy crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back the scum will join him
He will not cross And if by chance he does well throw him back into the sea
Theres a war coming Ned I dont know when I dont know who well be fighting but its coming 
Sit Youll be fed Untie them
Rapers They were given a choice no doubt Castration or the Wall Most choose the knife Not impressed by your new brothers Lovely thing about the Watch You discard your old family and get a whole new one
Why do you read so much
Look at me and tell me what you see
Is this a trick
What you see is a dwarf If Id been born a peasant they mightve left me out in the woods to die Alas I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock Things are expected of me My father was the Hand of the King for 20 years
Until your brother killed that King
Yes until my brother killed him Life is full of these little ironies My sister married the new King and my repulsive nephew will be King after him I must do my part for the honor of my house wouldnt you agree But how Well my brother has his sword and I have my mind And a mind needs books like a sword needs a whetstone Thats why I read so much And you Whats your story bastard
Ask me nicely and maybe Ill tell you dwarf
A bastard boy with nothing to inherit off to join the ancient order of the Nights Watch alongside his valiant brothersinarms
The Nights Watch protects the realm from
Yes yes against grumpkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about Youre a smart boy You dont believe that nonsense Everythings better with some wine in the belly 
Its time we reviewed the accounts my lady Youll want to know how much this royal visit has cost us
Talk to Poole about it
Poole went south with Lord Stark my lady We need a new steward and there are several other appointments that require our immediate attention
I dont care about appointments
Ill make the appointments Well talk about it first thing in the morning
Very good my Lord My Lady
When was the last time you left this room
I have to take care of him
Hes not going to die mother Maester Luwin says the most dangerous time has passed
What if hes wrong Bran needs me
Rickon needs you Hes six He doesnt know whats happening He follows me around all day clutching my leg crying
Close the windows I cant stand it Please make them stop
Fire You stay here Ill come back
Youre not supposed to be here No one is supposed to be here Its a mercy Hes dead already
No 
Have you ever seen a dragon
Dragon gone Khaleesi
Everywhere Even in the east
No dragon Brave men kill them It is known
It is known
A trader from Garth told me that dragons come from the moon
The moon
He told me the moon was an egg Khaleesi that once there were two moons in the sky But one wandered too close to the sun and it cracked from the heat Out of it poured a thousand thousand dragons and they drank the suns fire
Moon is no egg Moon is goddess wife of sun It is known
It is known
Leave me with her Why did the trader from Garth tell you these stories
Men like to talk when theyre happy Before your brother bought me for you it was my job to make men happy
How old were you
I was nine when my mother sold me to the pleasure house
Nine
I did not touch a man for three years Khaleesi First you must learn
Can you teach me how to make the Khal happy
Yes
Will it take three years
No 
Welcome 
What I am about to tell you must remain between us I dont think Bran fell from that tower I think he was thrown
The boy was always surefooted before
Someone tried to kill him twice Why Why murder an innocent child Unless he saw something he wasnt meant to see
Saw what my lady
I dont know But I would stake my life the Lannisters are involved We already have reason to suspect their loyalty to the crown
Did you notice the dagger the killer used Its too fine a weapon for such a man The blade is Valyrian steel the handle dragonbone Someone gave it to him
They come into our home and try to murder my brother If its war they want
If it comes to that you know Ill stand behind you
What is there going to be a battle in the Godswood Too easily words of war become acts of war We dont know the truth yet Lord Stark must be told of this
I dont trust a raven to carry these words
Ill ride to Kings Landing
No There must always be a Stark in Winterfell I will go myself
Mother you cant
I must
Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen to escort you
Too large a party attracts unwanted attention I dont want the Lannisters to know Im coming
Let me accompany you at least ingsroad can be a dangerous place for a woman alone
What about Bran
I have prayed to the Seven for more than a month Brans life is in their hands now 
No Khaleesi You must look in his eyes always Love comes in at the eyes It is said that Irogenia of Lys could finish a man with nothing but her eyes
Finish a man
Kings traveled across the world for a night with Irogenia Magisters sold their palaces Khals burned her enemies just to have her for a few hours They say a thousand men proposed to her and she refused them all
Well she sounds like an interesting woman I dont think that Drogo will like it with me on top
You will make him like it Khaleesi Men want what theyve never had And the Dothraki take slaves like a hound takes a bitch Are you a slave Khaleesi Then dont make love like a slave Very good Khaleesi Out there he is the mighty Khal but in this tent he belongs to you
I dont think that this is the Dothraki way
If he wanted the Dothraki way why did he marry you
No No Tonight I would look upon your face 
Pardon me Ser
Do I frighten you so much girl Or is it him there making you shake He frightens me too Look at that face
Im sorry if I offended you Ser Why wont he speak to me
He hasnt been very talkative these last 20 years Since the mad King had his tongue ripped out with hot pincers
He speaks damn well with his sword though Ser Ilyn Payne the Kings justice The royal executioner What is it sweet lady Does the hound frighten you Away with you dog Youre scaring my lady I dont like to see you upset The sun is finally shining Come walk with me
Stay Lady I probably shouldnt have any more Father only lets us have one cup at feasts
My princess can drink as much as she wants Dont worry Youre safe with me
Ill get you
Arya
What are you doing here Go away
Your sister And who are you boy
Mycah my Lord
He the butchers boy
Hes my friend
A butchers boy who wants to be a Knight eh Pick up your sword butchers boy Lets see how good you are
She asked me to my Lord She asked me to
Im your prince not your lord and I said pick up your sword
Its not a sword my prince Its only a stick
And youre not a Knight Only a butchers boy That was my ladys sister you were hitting do you know that
Stop it
Arya stay out of this
I wont hurt him Much Filthy little bitch
No no stop it stop it both of you Youre spoiling it Youre spoiling everything
Ill gut you you little cunt
Arya
Nymeria
Please dont
Arya leave him alone My prince my poor prince look what they did to you Stay here Ill go back to the inn and bring help
Then go Dont touch me 
The wolfs not here Look down by the stream
Youve got to go Theyll kill you for what you did to Joffrey Go on run Go Leave now
Its a direwolf
Ill check down here
I think I heard a noise
Go
My lord My lord They found her Shes unharmed
Where is she
Shes been taken directly before the King
Who took her
The Lannisters found her
Right get back
The Queen ordered them to bring her straight to him
Back Back to the inn All back 
Im sorry
Are you hurt
No
Its all right What is the meaning of this Why was my daughter not brought to me at once
How dare you speak to your King in that manner
Quiet woman Sorry Ned I never meant to frighten the girl But we need to get this business done quickly
Your girl and that butchers boy attacked my son That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off
Thats not true She just Bit him a little He was hurting Mycah
Joffrey told us what happened You and that boy beat him with clubs while you set your wolf on him
Thats not what happened
Yes it is They all attacked me and she threw my sword in the river
Liar
Shut up
Enough He tells me one thing she tells me another Seven hells What am I to make of this Wheres your other daughter Ned
In bed asleep
Shes not Sansa come here darling
Now child Tell me what happened Tell it all and tell it true Its a great crime to lie to a King
I dont know I dont remember Everything happened so fast I didnt see
Liar Liar liar liar
Arya
Stop it Thats enough of that
Liar liar liar
Stop Arya
Shes as wild as that animal of hers I want her punished
What would you have me do whip her through the streets Damn it children fight Its over
Joffrey will bear these scars for the rest of his life
You let that little girl disarm you See to it that your daughter is disciplined Ill do the same with my son
Gladly your Grace
And what of the direwolf What of the beast that savaged your son
Id forgot the damned wolf
We found no trace of the direwolf your Grace
So be it
We have another wolf
As you will
You cant mean it
A direwolfs no pet Get her a dog Shell be happier for it
He doesnt mean Lady does he No no not Lady Lady didnt bite anyone Shes good
Lady wasnt there You leave her alone
Stop them Dont let them do it Please It wasnt Lady
s this your command your Grace
Where is the beast
Chained up outside your Grace
Ser Ilyn do me the honor
No Jory Take the girls to their rooms If it must be done then Ill do it myself
Is this some trick
The wolf is of the north She deserves better than a butcher
The butchers boy You rode him down
Welcome Lord Stark Grand Maester Pycelle has called a meeting of the Small Council The honor of your presence is requested
Get the girls settled in Ill be back in time for supper And Jory you go with them
Yes my LordKing
If youd like to change into something more appropriate
Thank the gods youre here Stark About time we had some stern northern leadership
Glad to see youre protecting the throne
Sturdy old thing How many kings asses have polished it I wonder Whats the line ing shits and the Hand wipes
Very handsome armor Not a scratch on it
I know People have been swinging at me for years but they always seem to miss
Youve chosen your opponents wisely then
I have a knack for it It must be strange for you coming into this room I was standing right here when it happened He was very brave your brother Your father too They didnt deserve to die like that Nobody deserves to die like that
But you just stood there and watched
500 men just stood there and watched All the great knights of the Seven Kingdoms You think anyone said a word lifted a finger No Lord Stark 500 men and this room was silent as a crypt Except for the screams of course and the Mad King laughing And later When I watched the Mad King die I remembered him laughing as your father burned It felt like justice
Is that what you tell yourself at night Youre a servant of justice That you were avenging my father when you shoved your sword in Aerys Targaryens back
Tell me If Id stabbed the Mad King in the belly instead of the back would you admire me more
You served him well when serving was safe 
Lord Stark
Lord
I was grievously sorry to hear of your troubles on the Kingsroad We are all praying for Prince Joffreys full recovery
A shame you didnt say a prayer for the butchers son Renly Youre looking well
And you look tired from the road I told them this meeting could wait another day but
But we have a Kingdom to look after Ive hoped to meet you for some time Lord Stark No doubt Lady Catelyn has mentioned me
She has Lord Baelish I understand you knew my brother Brandon as well
All too well I still carry a token of his esteem from navel to collarbone
Perhaps you chose the wrong man to duel with
It wasnt the man that I chose my Lord It was Catelyn Tully A woman worth fighting for Im sure youll agree
I humbly beg your pardon my Lord Stark
Grand Maester
How many years has it been You were a young man
And you served another King
How forgetful of me This belongs to you now Should we begin
Without the King
Winter may be coming but Im afraid the same cannot be said for my brother
His Grace has many cares He entrusts some small matters to us that we might lighten the load
We are the lords of small matters here
My brother instructs us to stage a tournament in honor of Lord Starks appointment as Hand of the King
Mmm how much
40000 gold dragons to the champion 20000 to the runnerup 20000 to the winning archer
Can the treasury bear such expense
Ill have to borrow it The Lannisters will accommodate I expect We already owe Lord Tywin 3 million gold Whats another 80000
Are you telling me the Crown is three million in debt
Im telling you the Crown is six million in debt
How could you let this happen
The Master of Coin finds the money ing and the Hand spend it
I will not believe Jon Arryn allowed Robert to bankrupt the realm
Lord Arryn gave wise and prudent advice but I fear His Grace doesnt always listen
Counting coppers he calls it
Ill speak to him tomorrow This tournament is an extravagance we cannot afford
As you will But still wed best make our plans
There will be no plans until I speak to Robert Forgive me my Lords I had a long ride
You are the Kings Hand Lord Stark we serve at your pleasure 
Please its nearly healed
Its ugly
A King should have scars you fought off a direwolf Youre a warrior like your father
Im not like him I didnt fight off anything It bit me and all I did was scream And the two Stark girls saw it both of them
Thats not true You killed the beast You only spared the girl because of the love your father bears her father When Aerys Targaryen sat on the Iron Throne your father was a rebel and a traitor Someday youll sit on the throne and the truth will be what you make it
Do I have to marry her
Yes Shes very beautiful and young If you dont like her you only need to see her on formal occasions and when the time comes to make little princes and princesses And if youd rather fuck painted whores youll fuck painted whores And if youd rather lie with noble virgins so be it You are my darling boy and the world will be exactly as you want it to be Do something nice for the Stark girl
I dont want to
No but you will The occasional kindness will spare you all sorts of trouble down the road
We allow the northerners too much power They consider themselves our equals
How would you handle them
Id double their taxes and command them to supply 10000 men to the royal army
A royal army
Why should every lord command his own men Its primitive no better than the hill tribes We should have a standing army of men loyal to the Crown trained by experienced soldiers Instead of a mob of peasants whove never held pikes in their lives
And if the northerners rebel
Id crush them Seize Winterfell and install someone loyal to the realm as Warden of the North Uncle Kevan maybe
And these 10000 northern troops would they fight for you or their lord
For me Im their King
But youve just invaded their homeland asked them to kill their brothers
Im not asking
The North cannot be held not by an outsider Its too big and too wild When the winter comes the Seven gods together couldnt save you and your royal army A good King knows when to save his strength And when to destroy his enemies
So you agree The Starks are enemies
Everyone who isnt us is an enemy 
Enough of that young lady Eat your food
Im practicing
Practicing for what
The Prince
Arya stop
Hes a liar and a coward and he killed my friend
The Hound killed your friend
The Hound does whatever the Prince tells him to do
Youre an idiot
Youre a liar And if you told the truth Mycah would be alive
Enough
Whats happening here
Arya would rather act like a beast than a lady
Go to your room Well speak later Thats for you love
The same dollmaker makes all of Princess Myrcellas toys Dont you like it
I havent played with dolls since I was eight May I be excused
Youve barely eaten a thing
Its all right Go on
War was easier than daughters
Go away
Arya open the door May I come in Whose sword is that
Mine
Give it to me I know this makers mark This is Mikkens work Where did you get this This is no toy Little ladies shouldnt play with swords
I wasnt playing And I dont want to be a lady
Come here Now what do you want with this
Its called Needle
A blade with a name And who were you hoping to skewer with Needle Your sister Do you know the first thing about sword fighting
Stick em with the pointy end
Thats the essence of it
I was trying to learn I asked Mycah to practice with me I asked him It was my fault
No sweet girl You didnt kill the butchers boy
I hate them I hate all of them The Hound the Queen and the King and Joffrey and Sansa
Sansa was dragged before the King and Queen And asked to call the Prince a liar
So was I He is a liar
Darling listen to me Sansa will be married to Joffrey someday She cannot betray him She must take his side even when hes wrong
But how you can let her marry someone like that
Well Look at me Youre a Stark of Winterfell You know our words
Winter is coming
You were born in the long summer Youve never known anything else But now winter is truly coming And in the winter we must protect ourselves look after one another Sansa is your sister
I dont hate her Not really
I dont want to frighten you but I wont lie to you either Weve come to a dangerous place We cannot fight a war amongst ourselves All right Go on Its yours
I can keep it
Try not to stab your sister with it If youre going to own a sword youd better know how to use it 
Dont listen to it Crows are all liars I know a story about a crow
I hate your stories
I know a story about a boy who hated stories I could tell you about Ser Duncan the Tall Those were always your favorites
Those werent my favorites My favorites were the scary ones
Oh my sweet summer child What do you know about fear Fear is for the winter when the snows fall a hundred feet deep Fear is for the long night when the sun hides for years and children are born and live and die all in darkness That is the time for fear my little Lord when the White Walkers move through the woods Thousands of years ago there came a night that lasted a generation Kings froze to death in their castles same as the shepherds in their huts And women smothered their babies rather than see them starve and wept and felt the tears freeze on their cheeks So is this the sort of story that you like In that darkness the White Walkers came for the first time They swept through cities and kingdoms riding their dead horses hunting with their packs of pale spiders big as hounds
What are you telling him now
Only what the little Lord wants to hear
Get your supper I want some time with him One time she told me the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant named Macumber
Maybe we do
How do you feel You still dont remember anything Ive seen you climb a thousand times In the wind in the rain A thousand times You never fall
I did though Its true isnt it what Maester Luwin says about my legs Id rather be dead
Dont ever say that
Id rather be dead 
Fewer eyes back here my Lady But still too many
Its nine years since Ive set foot in the capital And no one knew who I was the last time I came either
My Lady
Welcome to Kings Landing Lady Stark Would you mind following us
I would Weve done nothing wrong
Weve been instructed to escort you into the city
Instructed I dont know whos providing your instructions but
Follow me Lady Stark
Cat Go on Go upstairs
You little worm You take me for some backalley Sally you can drag into a
I meant no disrespect to you of all people
How dare you bring me here Have you lost your mind
No one will come looking for you here Isnt that what like you wanted Im truly sorry about the locale
How did you know I was coming to Kings Landing
A dear friend told me
Lady Stark
Lord
To see you again after so many years is a blessing Your poor hands
How did you know I was coming
Knowledge is my trade my Lady Did you bring the dagger with you by any chance My little birds are everywhere Even in the north They whisper to me the strangest stories Valyrian steel
Do you know whose dagger this is
I must admit I do not
Well well this is an historic day Something you dont know that I do Theres only one dagger like this in all of the Seven Kingdoms Its mine
Yours
At least it was until the tournament on Prince Joffreys last nameday I bet on Ser Jaime in the jousting as any sane man would When the Knight of the Flowers unseated him I lost this dagger
To whom
Tyrion Lannister The Imp 
If that were a real sword youd be dead Lord Snow here grew up in a castle spitting down on the likes of you Pyp Do you think Ned Starks bastard bleeds like the rest of us
Next
Next
Lord Snow it appears youre the least useless person here Go clean yourselves up Theres only so much I can stomach in a day
A charming man
I dont need him to be charming I need him to turn this bunch of thieves and runaways into men of the Nights Watch
And hows that going Commander Mormont
Slowly A raven came for Ned Starks son
Good news or bad
Both 
Lord Stark I meant to give you this earlier So forgetful these days A raven from Winterfell this morning
Good news Perhaps youd like to share it with your wife
My wife is in Winterfell
Is she
I thought that shed be safest in here One of several such establishments I own
Youre a funny man A very funny man
Ned
The Starks Quick tempers slow minds 
You broke my nose bastard
Its an improvement
If we threw you over the Wall wonder how long itd take you to hit
I wonder if theyd find you before the wolves did
Whatre you looking at halfman
Im looking at you Youve got an interesting face Very distinctive faces All of you
What do you care about our faces
Its just I think they would look marvelous decorating spikes in Kings Landing Perhaps Ill write my sister the Queen about it
Well talk later Lord Snow
Everybody knew what this place was and no one told me No one but you My father knew and left me to rot here at the Wall all the same
Grenns father left him too Outside a farmhouse when he was three Pyp was caught stealing a wheel of cheese His little sister hadnt eaten in three days He was given a choice his right hand or the Wall Ive been asking the Lord Commander about them Fascinating stories
They hate me because Im better than they are
Its a lucky thing none of them were trained by a masteratarms like your Ser Rodrik I dont imagine any of them have ever held a real sword before they came here Your brother Bran Hes woken up 
The mere suggestion that the Queens brother tried to kill your boy would be considered treason
We have proof We have the blade
Which Lord Tyrion will say was stolen from him The only man who could say otherwise has no throat thanks to your boys wolf
Petyr has promised to help us find the truth Hes like a little brother to me He would never betray my trust
Ill try to keep you alive for her sake A fools task admittedly but Ive never been able to refuse your wife anything
I wont forget this Youre a true friend
Dont tell anyone I have a reputation to maintain 
How could you be so stupid
Calm down
Hes a child 10 years old What were you thinking
I was thinking of us Youre a bit late to start complaining about it now What has the boy told them
Nothing Hes said nothing He remembers nothing
Then what are you raving about
What if it comes back to him If he tells his father what he saw
Well say he was lying Well say he was dreaming Well say whatever we like I think we can outfox a 10yearold
And my husband
Ill go to war with him if I have to They can write a ballad about us The War for Cerseis Cunt
Let me go
Never
Let me go
The boy wont talk And if he does Ill kill him Him Ned Stark the King the whole bloody lot of them until you and I are the only people left in this world 
I wish I could see the girls
Its too dangerous
Just for a moment
Until we know who our enemies are
I know they did it Ned The Lannisters In my bones I know it
Littlefingers right I cant do anything without proof
And if you find the proof
Then I bring it to Robert And hope hes still the man I once knew You watch yourself on the road huh That temper of yours is a dangerous thing
My temper Gods be good you nearly killed poor Littlefinger yesterday
He still loves you
Does he
Off with you 
Its been a long time But I still remember every face You remember your first
Of course your Grace
Who was it
A Tyroshi Never learned the name
Howd you do it
Lance through the heart
Quick one Lucky for you Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall My horse took an arrow so I was on foot slogging through the mud He came running at me this dumb highborn lad thinking he could end the rebellion with the single swing of his sword I knocked him down with the hammer Gods I was strong then Caved in his breastplate Probably shattered every rib he had Stood over him hammer in the air Right before I brought it down he shouted Wait Wait They never tell you how they all shit themselves They dont put that part in the songs Stupid boy Now the Tarlys bend the knee like everyone else He could have lingered on the edge of the battle with the smart boys and today his wife would be making him miserable his sons would be ingrates and hed be waking three times in the night to piss into a bowl Wine Lancel Gods what a stupid name Who named you Some halfwit with a stutter What are you doing
Its empty your Grace
What do you mean its empty
Theres no more wine
Is that what empty means So get more Tell your cousin to get in here Kingslayer Get in here Surrounded by Lannisters Every time I close my eyes I see their blond hair and their smug satisfied faces It must wound your pride huh Standing out there like a glorified sentry  son of the mighty Tywin Forced to mind the door while your King eats and drinks and shits and fucks So come on Were telling war stories Who was your first kill not counting old men
One of the outlaws in the Brotherhood
I was there that day You were only a squire 16 years old
You killed Simon Toyne with a counter riposte Best move I ever saw
A good fighter Toyne but he lacked stamina
Your outlaw Any last words
I cut his head off so no
What about Aerys Targaryen What did the Mad King say when you stabbed him in the back I never asked Did he call you a traitor Did he plead for a reprieve
He said the same thing hed been saying for hours Burn them all If thats all your Grace 
Do the Dothrakis buy their slaves
The Dothraki dont believe in money Most of their slaves were given to them as gifts
From whom
If you rule a city and you see the horde approaching you have two choices pay tribute or fight An easy choice for most Of course sometimes its not enough Sometimes a Khal feels insulted by the number of slaves hes given He might think the men too weak or the women too ugly Sometimes a Khal decides his riders havent had a good fight in months and need the practice
Tell them all to stop
You want the entire horde to stop For how long
Until I command them otherwise
Youre learning to talk like a Queen
Not a Queen A Khaleesi
You dare You give commands to me To me You do not command the dragon I am Lord of the Seven Kingdoms I dont take orders from savages or their sluts Do you hear me
Rakharo ask if you want him dead Khaleesi
No
Rakharo say you should take ear to teach respect
Please please dont hurt him Tell him I dont want my brother harmed
Kill these Dothraki dogs I am your King
Shall we return to the Khalasar Khaleesi
You walk 
I wanted to be here when you saw it for the first time Im leaving this morning
Youre leaving
Im the First Ranger My job is out there There have been disturbing reports
What kind of reports
The kind I dont want to believe
m ready I wont let you down
Youre not going Youre no ranger Jon
But Im better than every
Better than no one Here A man gets what he earns when he earns it Well speak when I return 
A bears balls
Youre joking
And his brains and his guts his lungs and his heart all fried in his own fat When youre a hundred miles north of the Wall and you ate your last meal a week ago you leave nothing for the wolves
And how do a bears balls taste
A bit chewy And what about you my Lord Whats the strangest thing youve eaten
Do Dornish girls count So you roam the Seven Kingdoms collaring pickpockets and horse thieves and bringing them here as eager recruits
But its not all of ems done bad things Some of ems just poor lads looking for steady feed Some of ems highborn lads looking for glory
They have a better chance finding feed than glory
The Nights Watch is a joke to you is it Is that what we are Lannister An army of jesters in black
You dont have enough men to be an army and aside from Yoren here none of you are particularly funny
I hope weve provided you with some good stories to tell when youre back in Kings Landing But something to think about while youre drinking your wine down there enjoying your brothels Half the boys youve seen training will die north of the Wall Might be a wildings axe that gets them might be sickness might just be the cold They die in pain And they do it so plump little lords like you can enjoy their summer afternoons in peace and comfort
Do you think Im plump Listen Benjen May I call you Benjen
Call me what you like
Im not sure what Ive done to offend you I have great admiration for the Nights Watch Ive great admiration for you as First Ranger
You know my brother once told me that nothing someone says before the word but really counts
But I dont believe that giants and ghouls and White Walkers are lurking beyond the Wall I believe that the only difference between us and the wildlings is that when the Wall went up our ancestors happened to live on the right side of it
Youre right The wildlings are no different from us A little rougher maybe But theyre made of meat and bone I know how to track them and I know how to kill them Its not the wildlings giving me sleepless nights Youve never been north of the Wall so dont tell me whats out there
Are you going below Keep well keep warm
Enjoy the capital brother
I always do
I think hes starting to like me Going below 
Into the tunnel and out the other side Hell be north of the Wall for a month or two
So youre heading down to Kings Landing too
Day after tomorrow I get about half of my recruits from their dungeons
Lets share the road I could use some decent company
I travel a bit on the grubby side my Lord
Not this time Well be staying at the finest castles and inns No one turns away a Lannister 
Yes Khaleesi
What are you doing
When was last time you bleed Khaleesi You change Khaleesi Its a blessing from the Great Stallion
For a man on horseback the curved blade is a good thing easier to handle Its a good weapon for a Dothrakan But a man in full plate the arakh wont get through the steel Thats where the broadsword has the advantage Designed for piercing plate
Dothraki dont wear steel dresses
Armor
Armor Armor make a man Vroz
Slow
Slow
Its true but it also keeps a man alive
My father taught me how to fight He taught me that speed defeats size
Ive heard that your father was a famous warrior
He was bloodrider to Khal Bharbo And your father Jorah the Andal He was a warrior also
He still is A man of great honor And I betrayed him
haleesi wants to eat something different tonight Kill some rabbits
There are no rabbits
Find some ducks she likes ducks
Have you seen any ducks woman No rabbits no ducks Do you have eyes in your head Do you
Dog then I have seen many dogs
I dont think she wants to eat dog
haleesi have baby inside her It is true She does not bleed for two moons Her belly start to swell
A blessing from the Great Stallion
She does not want to eat horse
Ill have the boys butcher a goat for supper I need to ride to Qohor
We ride for Vaes Dothrak
Dont worry Ill catch you The hordes easy to find 
Dont stand so still Its harder to hit a moving target Except for you You move too much I could just hold my sword out and let you do the work for me
How many winters have you seen Lord Tyrion
Eight no nine
All of them brief
They say the winter of my birth was three years long
This summer has lasted nine But reports from the Citadel tell us the days grow shorter The Starks are always right eventually winter is coming This one will be long and dark things will come with it
Weve been capturing wildlings more every month Theyre fleeing south The ones who flee say theyve seen the White Walkers
Yes and the fishermen of Lannisport say they see mermaids
One of our own rangers swore he saw them kill his companions He swore it right up to the moment Ned Stark chopped his head off
The Nights Watch is the only thing standing between the realm and what lies beyond And it has become an army of undisciplined boys and tired old men There are less than a thousand of us now We cant man the other castles on the Wall We cant properly patrol the wilderness Weve barely enough resources to keep our lads armed and fed
Your sister sits by the side of the King Tell her we need help
When winter does come gods help us all if were not ready 
Its a boy
How do you know
I know 
Im sorry to see you leave Lannister
Its either me or this cold And it doesnt appear to be going anywhere
Will you stop at Winterfell on your way South
I expect I will Gods know there arent many feather beds between here and Kings Landing
If you see my brother Bran tell him I miss him Tell him Id visit if I could
Of course
Hell never walk again
If youre going to be a cripple its better to be a rich cripple Take care Snow
Farewell My Lord 
You are late boy Tomorrow you will be here at midday
Who are you
Your dancing master
Tomorrow you will catch it Now pick it up That is not the way boy This is not a great sword that is needing two hands to swing it
Its too heavy
It is heavy as it needs to be to make you strong Just so One hand is all that is needed Now you are standing all wrong Turn your body sideface So You are skinny That is good The target is smaller Now the grip Let me see The grip must be delicate
What if I drop it
The steel must be part of your arm Can you drop part of your arm No Nine years Syrio Forel was first sword to the Sealord of Braavos He knows these things You must listen to me boy
Im a girl
Boy girl You are a sword that is all That is the grip You are not holding a battleaxe You are holding
A needle
Ahhh Just so Now we will begin the dance Remember child this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning The knights dance hacking and hammering This is the Bravos dance The water dance It is swift and sudden All men are made of water do you know this If you pierce them the water leaks out and they die Now you will try to strike me
The little Lords been dreaming again
We have visitors
I dont want to see anyone
Really If I was cooped up all day with no one but this old bat for company Id go mad Anyway you dont have a choice Robbs waiting
I dont want to go
Neither do I But Robbs Lord of Winterfell which means I do what he says and you do what I say Hodor Help Bran down the hall
I must say I received a slightly warmer welcome on my last visit
Any man of the Nights Watch is welcome at Winterfell
Any man of the Nights Watch but not I eh boy
Im not your boy Lannister Im Lord of Winterfell while my father is away
Then you might learn a lords courtesy
So its true Hello Bran Do you remember anything about what happened
He has no memory of that day
Curious
Why are you here
Would your charming companion be so kind as to kneel My neck is beginning to hurt
Kneel Hodor
Do you like to ride Bran
Yes Well I mean I did like to
The boy has lost the use of his legs
What of it With the right horse and saddle even a cripple can ride
Im not a cripple
Then Im not a dwarf My father will rejoice to hear it I have a gift for you Give that to your saddler Hell provide the rest You must shape the horse to the rider Start with a yearling and teach it to respond to the reins and to the boys voice
Will I really be able to ride
You will On horseback you will be as tall as any of them
Is this some kind of trick Why do you want to help him
I have a tender spot in my heart for cripples bastards and broken things
Youve done my brother a kindness The hospitality of Winterfell is yours
Spare me your false courtesies Lord Stark Theres a brothel outside your walls There Ill find a bed and both of us can sleep easier
Couldnt resist some northern ass If you like redheads ask for Ros
Come to see me off Greyjoy Kind of you Your master doesnt seem to like Lannisters
Hes not my master
No of course not What happened here Where is lady Stark Why didnt she receive me
She wasnt feeling well
Shes not in Winterfell is she Where did she go
My ladys whereabouts
My lady Your loyalty to your captors is touching Tell me how do you think Balon Greyjoy would feel if he could see his only surviving son has turned lackey I still remember seeing my fathers fleet burn in Lannisport I believe your uncles were responsible
Must have been a pretty sight
Nothing prettier than watching sailors burn alive Yes a great victory for your people Shame how it all turned out
We were outnumbered 10 to one
A stupid rebellion then I suppose your father realized that when your brothers died in battle Now here you are your enemys squire
Careful Imp
Ive offended you Forgive me its been a rough morning Anyway dont despair Im a constant disappointment to my own father and Ive learned to live with it Your next tumble with Ros is on me Ill try not to wear her out 
Leg shoulder leg Left foot forward Good Now pivot as you deliver the stroke Put all your weight behind it
What in seven hells is that
Theyll need an eighth hell to fit him in
Tell them your name
Samwell Tarly of Horn Hill I mean I was of Horn Hill Ive come to take the black
Come to take the black pudding
Well you couldnt be any worse than you look See what he can do
I yield Please no more
On your feet Pick up your sword Hit him till he finds his feet It seems theyve run short of poachers and thieves down south Now they send us squealing bloody pigs Again harder
Enough He yielded
Looks like the bastards in love All right then lord Snow you wish to defend your lady love lets make it an exercise You two Three of you ought to be sufficient to make lady piggy squeal All youve got to do is get past the bastard
Are you sure you want to do this
No Yield yield yield I yield
Were done for today Go clean the armory Thats all youre good for
Well fought
Piss off
Did he hurt you
Ive had worse
You can call me Sam If you want My mother calls me Sam
Its not going to get any easier you know Youll have to defend yourself
Why didnt you get up and fight
I wanted to I just couldnt
Why not
Im a coward My father always says so
The Walls no place for cowards
Youre right Im sorry I just Wanted to thank you
A bloody coward People saw us talking to him Now theyll think were cowards too
Youre too stupid to be a coward
Youre too stupid to be a
Quick now before summers over
Come on here 
Vaes Dothrak The city of the horselords
A pile of mud Mud and shit and twigs best these savages can do
These are my people now You shouldnt call them savages
Ill call them what I like because theyre my people This is my army Khal Drogo is marching the wrong way with my army
If my brother was given an army of Dothraki could you conquer the Seven Kingdoms
The Dothraki have never crossed the Narrow Sea They fear any water their horses cant drink
But if they did
King Robert is fool enough to meet them in open battle but the men advising him are different
And you know these men
I fought beside them once long ago Now Ned Stark wants my head He drove me from my land
You sold slaves
Aye
Why
I had no money and an expensive wife
And where is she now
In another place with another man 
Your Grace
Yes my dear
They call you the last dragon
They do
You have dragons blood in your veins
Its entirely possible
What happened to the dragons I was told that brave men killed them all
The brave men didnt kill dragons The brave men rode them Rode them from Valyria to build the greatest civilization this world has ever seen The breath of the greatest dragon forged the Iron Throne which the Usurper is keeping warm for me The swords of the vanquished a thousand of them melted together like so many candles
I have always wanted to see a dragon There is nothing in the world that I would rather see
Really Why dragons
They can fly And wherever they are just a few flaps of their wings and theyre somewhere else Far away And they can kill Anyone or anything that tries to hurt them gets burned away to nothing melted like so many candles Seeing a dragon would make me very happy
Well after 15 years in a pleasure house I imagine just seeing the sky makes you happy
I was not locked in I have seen things
What have you seen
Ive seen A man from Asshai with a dagger of real dragonglass Ive seen a man who could change his face the way that other men change their clothes And Ive seen a pirate who wore his weight in gold and whose ship had sails of colored silk So Have you seen one
A pirate ship
A dragon
No the last one died many years before I was born Ill tell you what I have seen their skulls They used to decorate the throne room in the Red Keep When I was very young just 3 or 4 my father used to walk me down the rows and Id recite their names for him When I got them all right hed give me a sweet The ones closest to the door were the last ones they were able to hatch and they were all stunted and wrong Skulls no bigger than dog skulls But as you got closer to the Iron Throne They got bigger and bigger and bigger There was Ghiscar and Valryon Vermithrax Essovius Archonel Meraxes Vhagar And Balerion the Dread whose fire forged the Seven Kingdoms into one
What happened to the skulls
I dont know The Usurper had them smashed to powder I expect Scattered to the wind
Thats very sad
Yes it is What did I buy you for To make me sad
No your Grace To teach your sister
To teach my sister how to be a better lover You think I bought you to make Khal Drogo happy You pretty little idiot Go on then Get on with it 
Someday your husband will sit there and you will sit by his side And one day before too long you will present your son to the court All the lords of Westeros will gather here to see the little prince
What if I have a girl
Gods be good youll have boys and girls and plenty of them
What if I only have girls
I wouldnt worry about that
Jeyne Pooles mother had five children all of them girls
Yes but its highly unlikely
But what if
If you only had girls I suppose the throne would pass to Prince Joffreys little brother
And everyone would hate me
Nobody could ever hate you
Joffrey does
Nonsense Why would you say such a thing That business with the wolves Ive told you a hundred times A direwolf is not
Please shut up about it
Do you remember your lessons Who built the Iron Throne
Aegon the Conqueror
And who built the Red Keep
Maegor the Cruel
And how many years did it take to build
My grandfather and uncle were murdered here werent they
They were killed on the orders of King Aerys yes
The Mad King
Commonly known as the Mad King
Why were they killed
You should speak to your father about these matters
I dont want to speak to my father ever
You will find it in your heart to forgive your father
No I wont 
Its the Hands tournament thats causing all this trouble my Lords
ings tournament I assure you the Hand wants no part of it
Call it what you will Lord Stark Ser the city is packed with people and more flooding in every day Last night we had a tavern riot a brothel fire three stabbings and a drunken horse race down the Street of Sisters
Dreadful
If you cant keep the Kings peace perhaps the City Watch should be commanded by someone who can
I need more men
Youll get 50 Lord Baelish will see it paid for
I will
You found money for a champions purse you can find money to keep the peace Ill also give you 20 of my household guards till the crowds have left
Thank you my Lord Hand Ser They will be put to good use
The sooner this is over the better
The realm prospers from such events my Lord They give the great a chance at glory and the lowly a respite from their woes
And every inn in the city is full and the whores are walking bowlegged
Im sure the tourney puts coins in many a pocket Now If theres nothing else my Lords
This heat On days like this I envy you northerners your summer snows Until tomorrow my Lord
Ive been hoping to talk to you about Jon Arryn
Lord Arryn His death was a great sadness to all of us I took personal charge of his care but I could not save him His sickness struck him very hard and very fast I saw him in my chambers just the night before he passed Lord Jon often came to me for counsel
Why
I have been Grand Maester for many years Kings and Hands have come to me for advice since
What did Jon want the night before he died
He came inquiring after a book
A book What book
I fear it would be of little interest to you my Lord A ponderous tome
Id like to read it
The lineages and histories of the great houses of the Seven Kingdoms with descriptions of many high lords and noble ladies and their children
Harkon Umber first of his name born to lord Hother Umber and lady Amaryllis Umber in the 183rd year after Aegons landing at the last hearth Blue of eye brown of hair and fair complected died in his 14th year of a wound sustained in a bear hunt
As I said my Lord a ponderous read
Did Jon Arryn tell you what he wanted with it
He did not my Lord And I did not presume to ask
Jons death
Such a tragedy
Did he say anything to you during his final hours
Nothing of import my Lord There was one phrase he kept repeating The seed is strong I think it was
The seed is strong  What does that mean
The dying mind is a demented mind Lord Stark For all the weight theyre given last words are usually as significant as first words
And youre quite certain he died of a natural illness
What else could it be
Poison
A disturbing thought I dont think it likely The Hand was loved by all What sort of man would dare
Ive heard it said that poison is a womans weapon
Yes Women cravens and eunuchs Did you know that lord Varys is a eunuch
Everybody knows that
Yes yes of course How that sort of person found himself on the Kings Council I will never know
Ive taken enough of your time
No trouble at all my Lord Its a great honor
Thank you Ill find my own way out 
Syrio says a water dancer can stand on one toe for hours
Its a hard fall down these steps
Syrio says every hurt is a lesson and every lesson makes you better Tomorrow Im going to be chasing cats
Cats Syrio says
He says every swordsman should study cats Theyre quiet as shadows and as light as feathers You have to be quick to catch them
Hes right about that
Now that Brans awake will he come live with us
He needs to get his strength back first
He wants to be a knight of the Kings Guard He cant be one now can he
No But someday he could be Lord of a holdfast or sit on the Kings Council Or he might raise castles like Brandon the Builder
Can I be Lord of a holdfast
You will marry a high Lord and rule his castle And your sons shall be knights and princes and lords
No Thats not me 
Hello Ser Alliser said Im to be your new watch partner I should warn you I dont see all that well
Come stand by the fire Its warmer
No thats all right Im fine
Youre not Youre freezing
I dont like high places
You cant fight You cant see Youre afraid of heights and almost everything else probably What are you doing here Sam
On the morning of my 18th nameday my father came to me Youre almost a man now he said but youre not worthy of my land and title Tomorrow youre going to take the black forsake all claim to your inheritance and start north If you do not he said then well have a hunt and somewhere in these woods your horse will stumble and youll be thrown from your saddle to die Or so Ill tell your mother Nothing would please me more Ser Allisers going to make me fight again tomorrow isnt he
Yes he is
Im not going to get any better you know
Well You cant get any worse 
I hear youre reading a boring book
Pycelle talks too much
He never stops Do you know Ser Hugh of the Vale Not surprising Until recently he was only a squire Jon Arryns squire He was knighted almost immediately after his masters untimely death
Knighted for what Why are you telling me this
I promised Cat that Id help you
Where is Ser Hugh Ill speak to him
A singularly bad idea Do you see that boy there One of Varyss little birds The Spider has taken a great interest in your comings and goings Now look there That one belongs to the Queen And do you see that Septa pretending to read her book
Varys or the Queen
No Shes one of mine Is there someone in your service whom you trust completely
Yes
The wiser answer was no my Lord Get a message to this paragon of yours Discreetly Send him to question Ser Hugh After that you might want him to visit a certain armorer in the city He lives in a large house at the top of the street of Steel
Why
I have my observers as I said and its possible that they saw Lord Arryn visit this armorer several times in the weeks before his death
Lord Baelish perhaps I was wrong to distrust you
Distrusting me was the wisest thing youve done since you climbed off your horse 
Ser Hugh Ser Hugh
As you can see Im busy
Im here on behalf of Lord Eddard Stark the Hand of the king Im the captain of his guard
Im sorry I didnt catch your name Ser
No ser Im not a knight
I see Well it just so happens that I am 
He said hed be glad to talk to the Hand himself Hes a knight you see
A knight They strut around like roosters down here Even the ones whove never seen an arrow coming their way
You shouldnt be out here my Lord Theres no telling who has eyes where
Let them look
The former Hand did call on me my Lord several times I regret to say he did not honor me with his patronage
What did Lord Arryn want
He always came to see the boy
Id like to see him as well
As you wish my Lord Gendry Here he is Strong for his age He works hard Show the Hand the helmet you made lad
This is fine work
Its not for sale
Boy this is the Kings Hand If his lordship wants the helmet
I made it for me
Forgive him my Lord
Theres nothing to forgive When Lord Arryn came to visit you what would you talk about
He just asked me questions is all my Lord
What kind of questions
About my work at first if I was being treated well if I liked it here But then he started asking me about my mother
Your mother
Who she was what she looked like
What did you tell him
She died when I was little She had yellow hair Shed sing to me sometimes
Look at me Get back to work lad If the day ever comes when that boyd rather wield a sword than forge one you send him to me
Find anything
King Roberts bastard son 
This is for the King from Lord Stark
Listen Do you hear them How many do you think are in there with him Guess
Three Four
He likes to do this when Im on duty He makes me listen as he insults my sister
Forgive me my Lord
Why do I have to forgive you Have you wronged me
Weve met before you know
Have we Strange Ive forgotten
The siege of Pyke We fought side by side one afternoon
Thats where you got your scar
Aye One of the Greyjoys nearly took my eye
Vicious sons of whores
They like their bloodshed
They stopped liking it at the end That was a proper battle Dyou remember Thoros of Myr charging through the breach
With his burning sword Ill remember that till the day I die
I saw the youngest of the Greyjoy lads at Winterfell It was like seeing a shark on a mountaintop
Theon Hes a good lad
I doubt it
Ill bet you smell of blackberry jam Let me smell it Come here
Can I leave this with you The message from Lord Stark
I dont serve Lord Stark 
Where have you been
Watch duty With Sam
Prince Porkchop Where is he
He wasnt hungry
Impossible
Thats enough Sams no different from the rest of us There was no place for him in the world so hes come here Were not going to hurt him in the training yard anymore Never again no matter what Thorne says Hes our brother now and were going to protect him
You are in love Lord Snow You girls can do as you please But if Thorne puts me up against Lady Piggy Im gonna slice me off a side of baconAll of the new recruits are sleeping Jon Ghost  Pyp and Grenn ambush and gag Rast as he sleeps Jon threatens him
No one touches Sam
What are you waiting for Attack him You get in there
Hit me Go on hit me I yield Yield yield I yield
You think this is funny do you When youre out there beyond the Wall with the sun going down do you want a man at your back Or a sniveling boy 
You send this whore to give me commands I should have sent you back her head
Forgive me Khaleesi I did as you asked
Hush now Its all right  take her and leave us
Yes Khaleesi
Why did you hit her
How many times do I have to tell you You do not command me
I wasnt commanding you I just wanted to invite you to supper
Whats this
Its a gift I had it made for you
Dothraki rags Are you going to dress me now
Please
This stinks of manure All of it
Stop stop it
You would turn me into one of them wouldnt you Next youll want to braid my hair
Youve no right to a braid Youve won no victories yet
You do not talk back to me
You are a horselords slut And now youve woken the dragon
I am a Khaleesi of the Dothraki I am the wife of the great Khal and I carry his son inside me The next time you raise a hand to me will be the last time you have hands 
I know for a fact that some of the officers go to that brothel in Moles Town
I wouldnt doubt it
Dont you think its a little bit unfair Making us take our vows while they sneak off for a little sally on the side
Sally on the side
Its silly isnt it What we cant defend the Wall unless were celibate Its absurd
I didnt think youd be so upset about it
Why not Because Im fat But I like girls just as much as you do They might not like me as much Ive never been with one Youve probably had hundreds
As a matter of fact Im the same as you
I find that hard to believe
I came very close once I was alone in a room with a naked girl but
You didnt know where to put it
I know where to put it
Was she Old and ugly
Young and gorgeous A whore named Ros
What color hair
Red
I like red hair And her Her
You dont want to know
That good
Better
Oh no So why exactly did you not make love to Ros with the perfect
Whats my name

And why is my surname Snow
Because Youre a bastard from the north
I never met my mother My father wouldnt even tell me her name I dont know if shes living or dead I dont know if shes a noblewoman or a fishermans wife Or a whore So I sat there in the brothel as Ros took off her clothes But I couldnt do it Because all I could think was what if I got her pregnant and she had a child another bastard named Snow Its not a good life for a child
So You didnt know where to put it
Enjoying yourselves You look cold boys
It is a bit nippy
A bit nippy yeah by the fire indoors Its still summer Do you boys even remember the last winter How long has it been now What 10 years I remember Was it uncomfortable at Winterfell Were there days when you just couldnt get warm never mind how many fires your servants built
I build my own fires
Thats admirable I spent six months out there beyond the Wall during the last winter It was supposed to be a twoweek mission We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch So we went out to look for some of his men Capture them gather some knowledge The Wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men Harder than youll ever be They know their country better than we do They knew there was a storm coming in So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass And we got caught in the open Wind so strong it yanked 100foot trees straight from the ground roots and all If you took your gloves off to find your cock to have a piss you lost a finger to the frost And all in darkness You dont know cold Neither of you do The horses died first We didnt have enough to feed them to keep them warm Eating the horses was easy But later when we started to fall That wasnt easy We should have had a couple of boys like you along shouldnt we Soft fat boys like you Wed have lasted a fortnight on you and still had bones leftover for soup Soon well have new recruits and you lot will be passed along to the Lord Commander for assignment and they will call you men of the Nights Watch but youd be fools to believe it Youre boys still And come the winter you will die Like flies 
I hit him I hit the dragon
Your brother Rhaegar was the last dragon Viserys is less than the shadow of a snake
He is still the true King
The truth now do you want to see your brother sitting on the Iron Throne
No But the common people are waiting for him Illyrio said theyre sewing dragon banners and praying for his return
The common people pray for rain health and a summer that never ends They dont care what games the high Lords play
What do you pray for Ser Jorah
Home
I pray for home too My brother will never take back the Seven Kingdoms He couldnt lead an army even if my husband gave him one Hell never take us home 
Lovers quarrel
Im sorry Do I 
Sansa dear this is Lord Baelish Hes known
An old friend of the family Ive known your mother a long long time
Why do they call you Littlefinger
Arya
Dont be rude
No its quite all right When I was a child I was very small and I come from a little spit of land called The Fingers so you see its an exceedingly clever nickname
Ive been sitting here for days Start the damn joust before I piss myself
Gods who is that
Ser Gregor Clegane They call him the Mountain The Hounds older brother
And his opponent
Ser Hugh of the Vale He was Jon Arryns squire Look how far hes come
Yes yes Enough of the bloody pomp Have at it
Not what you were expecting Has anyone ever told you the story of the Mountain and the Hound Lovely little tale of brotherly love The Hound was just a pup six years old maybe Gregor a few years older already a big lad already getting a bit of a reputation Some lucky boys just born with a talent for violence One evening Gregor found his little brother playing with a toy by the fire Gregors toy a wooden knight Gregor never said a word he just grabbed his brother by the scruff of his neck and shoved his face into the burning coals Held him there while the boy screamed while his face melted There arent very many people who know that story
I wont tell anyone I promise
No please dont If the Hound so much as heard you mention it Im afraid all the knights in Kings Landing would not be able to save you 
My Lord Her Grace the Queen
Your Grace
Youre missing your tournament
Putting my name on it doesnt make it mine
I thought we might put what happened on the Kingsroad behind us  the ugliness with the wolves And forcing you to kill the beast was extreme Though sometimes we go to extremes where our children are concerned How is Sansa
She likes it here
The only Stark who does Favors her mother not much of the north in her
What are you doing here
I might ask the same of you What is it you hope to accomplish
ing called on me to serve him and the realm and thats what Ill do until he tells me otherwise
You cant change him You cant help him Hell do what he wants which is all hes ever done Youll try your best to pick up the pieces
If thats my job then so be it
Youre just a soldier arent you You take your orders and you carry on I suppose it makes sense Your older brother was trained to lead and you were trained to follow
I was also trained to kill my enemies Your Grace
As was I 
Seven blessings to you goodfolk
And to you
Boy Bread meat and beer quickly
Good idea grandfather Im starving A song while we wait or
Id rather throw myself down a well
Grandfather may be your last chance if youre heading north The only music the northerners know is the howling of wolves
Im sorry my Lord were full up Every room
My men can sleep in the stable As for myself I dont require a large room
Truly my lord we have nothing
Is there nothing I can do to remedy this
You can have my room
Theres a clever man You can manage food I trust  dine with me
Aye my Lord
My Lord of Lannister Might I entertain you while you eat I can sing of your fathers victory at Kings Landing
Nothing would more likely ruin my supper Lady Stark What an unexpected pleasure I was sorry to have missed you at Winterfell
Lady Stark
I was still Catelyn Tully the last time I stayed here You Ser Is that the black bat of Harrenhal I see embroidered on your coat
It is my Lady
And is Lady Whent a true and honest friend to my father Lord Hoster Tully of Riverrun
She is
The red stallion was always a welcome sight at Riverrun My father counts Jonas Bracken amongst his oldest and most loyal bannermen
Our lord is honored by his trust
I envy your father all his fine friends but I dont quite see the purpose of this
Lord Walder is well my Lady He has asked your father for the honor of his presence on his 90th nameday He plans to take another wife
Does Ser Hugh have any family in the capital
No I stood vigil for him myself last night He had no one else
Hed never worn this armor before
Bad luck for him Going against the Mountain
Who determines the draw
All the knights draw straws Lord Stark
Aye But who holds the straws Youve done good work Sisters
Life is strange Not so many years ago we fought as enemies at the Trident
Im glad we never met on the field Ser Barristan as is my wife I dont think the widows life would suit her
Youre too modest Ive seen you cut down a dozen great knights
My father once told me you were the best hed ever seen I never knew the man to be wrong about matters of combat
He was a fine man your father What the Mad King did to him was a terrible crime
And that lad He was a squire until a few months ago How could he afford a new suit of armor
Perhaps Lord Arryn left him some money I hear the King wants to joust today
Yes That will never happen
Robert tends to do what he wants
If the King got what he wanted all the time wed still be fighting a damned rebellion
Its made too small Your Grace It wont go
Your mother was a dumb whore with a fat arse Did you know that Look at this idiot One ball and no brains He cant even put a mans armor on him properly
Youre too fat for your armor
Fat Fat is it Is that how you speak to your King That was funny is it
Oh its funny is it
No Your Grace
No You dont like the Hands joke
Youre torturing the poor boy
You heard the Hand ings too fat for his armor Go find the breastplate stretcher now
The breastplate stretcher
How long before he figures it out
Maybe you should have one invented
All right all right But you watch me out there I still know how to point a lance
You have no business jousting Leave that for the young men
Why Because Im king Piss on that I want to hit somebody
And whos going to hit you back
Anybody who can And the last man in his saddle will be you
Theres not a man in the Seven Kingdoms would risk hurting you
Are you telling me those cowards would let me win
Aye
Drink
Im not thirsty
Drink Your King commands it Gods Too fat for my armor
Your squire A Lannister boy
Hmm A bloody idiot But Cersei insisted I have Jon Arryn to thank for her Cersei Lannister will make a good match  he told me Youll need her father on your side I thought being King meant I could do whatever I wanted Enough of this Lets go watch em ride At least I can smell someone elses blood
Robert
What Oh An inspiring sight for the people eh Come Bow before your King Bow you shits 
Wheres Arya
At her dancing lessons night of the Flowers
Thank you Ser Loras
Dont let Ser Gregor hurt him
Hey
I cant watch
100 gold dragons on the Mountain
Ill take that bet
Now what will I buy with 100 gold dragons A dozen barrels of Dornish wine Or a girl from the pleasure houses of Lys
Or you could even buy a friend
Hes going to die
Ser Loras rides well
Such a shame Littlefinger It would have been so nice for you to have a friend
And tell me Lord Renly when will you be having your friend
Loras knew his mare was in heat Quite crafty really
Ser Loras would never do that Theres no honor in tricks
No honor but quite a bit of gold
Stop this madness in the name of your King
I owe you my life Ser
Im no Ser 
Remove his hood
On that eve the captive Imp downwards from his horse did limp no more would he preen and primp in garb of red and gold
This isnt the Kingsroad You said we were riding for Winterfell
I did often and loudly
Very wise Theyll be out in droves looking for me in the wrong place Words probably gotten to my father by now Hell be offering a handsome reward Everyone knows a Lannister always pays his debts Would you be so good as to untie me
And why would I do that
Why not Am I going to run The hill tribes would kill me for my boots Unless a Shadowcat ate me first
Shadowcats and hill tribes are the least of your concerns
Ah the Eastern Road Were going to The Vale Youre taking me to your sisters to answer for my imagined crimes Tell me Lady Stark When was the last time you saw your sister
Five years ago
Shes changed She was always a bit touched but now you might as well kill me here
I am not a murderer Lannister
Neither am I I had nothing to do with the attempt on your sons life
The dagger found
What sort of imbecile arms an assassin with his own blade
Should I gag him
Why Am I starting to make sense
My Lady this way
Untie me If I die whats the point
Rodrik
Ill be fine my Lady Theres no need to bloody yourself
Your first You need a woman Nothing like a woman after a fight
Well Im willing if she is 
Bran
The Iron Islands Sigil a Kraken Words We do not sow
Lords
The Greyjoys
Famed for their skills at archery navigation and lovemaking
And failed rebellions
Sigil a stag A crowned stag now that Roberts King
Good
Words Ours is the fury Lords the Baratheons
Mhmm
The Westerlands sigil a lion
Hmm
Words A Lannister always pays his debts
No A common saying but not their official motto
Lords the Lannisters
Were still on their words
I dont know them
You do know them Think
Unbowed unbent unbroken
Thats House Martell
Righteous in wrath
House Hornwood
Family duty honor
Those are Tully words Your mothers Are we playing a game
Family duty honor Is that the right order
You know it is
Family comes first
Your mother had to leave Winterfell to protect the family
How can she protect the family if shes not with her family
Your mother sat by your bed for three weeks while you slept
And then she left
When you were born I was the one who pulled you from your mother I placed you in her arms From that moment until the moment she dies she will love you Absolutely Fiercely
Why did she leave
I still cant tell you but she will be home soon
Do you know where she is now Today
No I dont
Then how can you promise me shell be home soon
Sometimes I worry youre too smart for your own good
Ill never shoot another arrow
And where is that written
You need legs to work a bow
Hmm If the saddle Lord Tyrion designed actually works you could learn to shoot a bow from horseback
Really
Dothraki boys learn when theyre four years old Why shouldnt you 
Shh Keep it down Youre not supposed to be inside the castle walls
I thought you were supposed to be an important person around here
Important enough for the likes of you
Youre not the only nobleman in my life you know
Who the Imp Id call him half a nobleman
Jealous
Why should I be jealous
Anyone with a few coppers in his pocket can own you for the night Whats a dwarf like down below Ive always wondered
Might surprise you
Hmm
Hes good with his fingers too And his tongue
Generous tipper I guess gold is cheap for a Lannister
You are jealous
Im a Greyjoy Weve been Lords of the Iron Islands for 300 years Theres not a family in Westeros that can look down on us not even the Lannisters
And what about the Starks
Ive been Lord Starks ward since I was eight years old
A ward thats a nice word for it Your father rebelled against King Robert and if he does it again
My father fought for the freedom of his people What did your father do Fucked a cook and whelped a whore
Youre a very serious boy
Im not a boy
Oh yes you are A serious boy with a serious cock
I dont want to pay for it
Then get yourself a wife 
Come on Im not gonna hurt you
How is your son my Lord
Hell never walk again
But his mind is sound
So they say
A blessing then I suffered an early mutilation myself Some doors close forever others open in the most unexpected places May I
If the wrong ears heard what Im about to tell you off comes my head And who would mourn poor Varys then North or South they sing no songs for spiders But there are things you must know You are the Kings Hand and the King is a fool your friend I know but a fool and doomed unless you save him
Ive been in the capital a month Why have you waited so long to tell me this
I didnt trust you
So why do you trust me now
The Queen is not the only one who has been watching you closely There are few men of honor in the capital You are one of them I would like to believe I am another strange as that may seem
What sort of doom does the King face
The same sort as Jon Arryn The tears of Lys they call it A rare and costly thing as clear and tasteless as water It leaves no trace
Who gave it to him
Some dear friend no doubt But which one There were many Lord Arryn was a kind and trusting man There was one boy all he was he owed to Jon Arryn
The squire Ser Hugh
Pity what happened to him just when his life seemed to be going so nicely
If Ser Hugh poisoned him who paid Ser Hugh
Someone who could afford it
Jon was a man of peace He was Hand for 17 years 17 good years Why kill him
He started asking questions 
Hes found one bastard already He has the book The rest will come
And when he knows the truth what will he do
The gods alone know The fools tried to kill his son Whats worse they botched it The wolf and the lion will be at each others throats We will be at war soon my friend
What good is war now Were not ready If one Hand can die why not a second
This Hand is not the other
We need time Khal Drogo will not make his move until his son is born You know how these savages are
Delay you say Move fast I reply This is no longer a game for two players
It never was 
The first to arrive and the last to leave I admire your industry
You do move quietly
We all have our qualities
You look a bit lonely today You should pay a visit to my brothel this evening First boy is on the house
I think youre mistaking business with pleasure
Am I All those birds that whisper in your ear such pretty little things Trust me we accommodate all inclinations
Oh Im sure Lord Redwyne likes his boys very young I hear
Im a purveyor of beauty and discretion both equally important
Though I suppose beauty is a subjective quality no Is it true that Ser Marlon of Tumblestone prefers amputees
All desires are valid to a man with a full purse
And I heard the most awful rumor about a certain lord with a taste for fresh cadavers Must be enormously difficult to accommodate that inclination The logistics alone to find beautiful corpses before they rot
Strictly speaking such a thing would not be in accordance with the Kings laws
Strictly speaking
Tell me Does someone somewhere keep your balls in a little box Ive often wondered
Do you know I have no idea where they are And we had been so close But enough about me How have you been since we last saw each other
Since you last saw me or since I last saw you
Now the last time I saw you you were talking to the Hand of the King
Saw me with your own eyes
Eyes I own
Council business We all have so much to discuss with Ned Stark
Everyones well aware of your enduring fondness for Lord Starks wife If the Lannisters were behind the attempt on the Stark boys life and it was discovered that you helped the Starks come to that conclusion To think A simple word to the Queen
One shudders at the thought
Oh
But you know something I do believe that I have seen you even more recently than you have seen me
Have you
Yes Earlier today I distinctly recall seeing you talking to Lord Stark in his chambers
Was that you under the bed
And not long after that when I saw you escorting a certain foreign dignitary Council business Of course you would have friends from across The Narrow Sea Youre from there yourself after all Were friends arent we Lord  Id like to think we are So you can imagine my burden wondering if the King might question my friends sympathies To stand at a crossroads where turning left means loyalty to a friend turning right loyalty to the realm
Oh please
To find myself in a position where a simple word to the King 
What are you two conspiring about Well whatever it is youd best hurry up My brother is coming
To a small council meeting
Disturbing news from far away Havent you heard 
Off with you No begging
Im not a beggar I live here
Dyou want a smack on your ear to help you with your hearing
I want to see my father
I want to fuck the Queen for all the good it does me
You want your father boy Hes lying on the floor of some tavern getting pissed on by his friends
My father is Hand of the King Im not a boy Im Arya Stark of Winterfell and if you lay a hand on me my father will have both your heads on spikes Now are you going to let me by or do I need to smack you on the ear to help with your hearing
You know I had half my guard out searching for you You promised me this would stop
They said they were going to kill you
Who did
I didnt see them but I think one was fat
Oh Arya
Im not lying They said you found the bastard and the wolves are fighting the lions and the savage something about the savage
Where did you hear this
In the dungeons near the dragon skulls
What were you doing in the dungeons
Chasing a cat
Pardon my Lord Theres a Nights Watchman here begging a word He says its urgent
Your name friend
Yoren if it please This must be your son He has the look
Im a girl
Did Benjen send you
No one sent me my Lord Im here to find men for The Wall see if theres any scum in the dungeons that might be fit for service
Ah well find recruits for you
Thank you my Lord But thats not why I disturb you now Your brother Benjen his blood runs black makes him as much my brother as yours Its for his sake I rode here so hard I damn near killed my horse There are others riding too The whole city will know by tomorrow
Know what
Best said in private my Lord
Go on Well talk more later
Jory take her safely to her room
Come along my Lady You heard your father
How many guards does my father have
Here in Kings Landing Fifty
You wouldnt let anyone kill him would you
No fear on that count little Lady
Well
Its about your wife my Lord Shes taken the Imp 
Youre far from home Lady Stark
To whom do I speak
Ser Vardis Egen Knight of The Vale Is Lady Arryn expecting your visit
There was no time to send word
May I ask my Lady why he is with you
Thats why there was no time He is my prisoner
He doesnt look like a prisoner
My sister will decide what he looks like
Yes my Lady She will at that
The Eyrie They say its impregnable
Give me 10 good men and some climbing spikes Ill impregnate the bitch
I like you 
Lord Stark your presence has been requested in the small council chamber A meeting has been called
I need to see the King first alone
ing is at the small council meeting my Lord He has summoned you
Is it about my wife
No my Lord I believe it concerns Daenerys Targaryen
The whore is pregnant
Youre speaking of murdering a child
I warned you this would happen Back in the North I warned you but you didnt care to hear Well hear it now I want em dead mother and child both And that fool Viserys as well Is that plain enough for you I want them both dead
You will dishonor yourself forever if you do this
Honor Ive got Seven Kingdoms to rule One King Seven Kingdoms Do you think honor keeps them in line Do you think its honor thats keeping the peace Its fear Fear and blood
Then were no better than the Mad King
Careful Ned Careful now
You want to assassinate a girl Because the Spider heard a rumor
No rumor my Lord The princess is with child
Based on whose information
Ser Jorah Mormont He is serving as adviser to the Targaryens
Mormont You bring us the whispers of a traitor half a world away and call it fact
Jorah Mormonts a slaver not a traitor Small difference I know to an honorable man
He broke the law betrayed his family fled our land We commit murder on the word of this man
And if hes right If she has a son A Targaryen at the head of a Dothraki army What then
The Narrow Sea still lies between us Ill fear the Dothraki the day they teach their horses to run on water
Do nothing Thats your wise advice Do nothing til our enemies are on our shores Youre my council Counsel Speak sense to this honorable fool
I understand your misgivings my Lord Truly I do It is a terrible thing we must consider a vile thing Yet we who presume to rule must sometimes do vile things for the good of the realm Should the gods grant Daenerys a son the realm will bleed
I bear this girl no ill will but should the Dothraki invade how many innocents will die How many towns will burn Is it not wiser kinder even that she should die now so that tens of thousands might live
We should have had them both killed years ago
When you find yourself in bed with an ugly woman best close your eyes get it over with Cut her throat Be done with it
I followed you into war twice without doubts without second thoughts But I will not follow you now The Robert I grew up with didnt tremble at the shadow of an unborn child
She dies
I will have no part in it
Youre the Kings Hand Lord Stark Youll do as I command or Ill find me a Hand who will
And good luck to him I thought you were a better man
Out Out damn you Im done with you Go Run back to Winterfell Ill have your head on a spike Ill put it there myself you fool You think youre too good for this Too proud and honorable This is a war 
Ill go ahead with my daughters Get them ready Do it yourself Dont ask anyone for help
Right away my Lord Lord Baelish is here for you
His Grace went on about you at some length after you took your leave The word treason was mentioned
What can I do for you
When do you return to Winterfell
Why What do you care
If youre still here come nightfall Ill take you to see the last person Jon Arryn spoke with before falling ill If that sort of thing still interests you
I dont have the time
It wont take more than an hour But as you please
Round up all the men we have and station them outside the girls chambers Who are your best two swords
Heward and Wyl
Find them and meet me at the stables 
You bring him here without permission You pollute my home with his presence Your aunt has done a bad thing Robin a very bad thing You remember her dont you Isnt he beautiful And strong too Jon knew it His last words were the seed is strong He wanted everyone to know what a good strong boy his son would grow up to be Look at him the Lord of all the Vale
Lysa you wrote me about the Lannisters warning me t
To stay away from them Not to bring one here
Mommy Is that the bad man
It is
Hes little
Hes Tyrion the Imp of House Lannister He killed your father He murdered the Hand of the King
Oh Did I kill him too Ive been a very busy man
You will watch your tongue These men are Knights of the Vale Every one of the loved Jon Arryn Every one of them would die for me
If any harm comes to me my brother Jaime will see that they do
You cant hurt us No one can hurt us here Tell him mommy Tell him
Shh Shh Shh my sweet boy Hes just trying to frighten us Lannisters are all liars No one will hurt my baby
Mommy I want to see the bad man fly
Perhaps you will my little love
This man is my prisoner I will not have him harmed
Ser Vardis my sisters guest is weary Take him down below so he can rest Introduce him t
You go sleep dwarf man Sleep good little dwarf man 
Lord Starks lucky he still has a head
Robert will rant for a few days but he wont do anything He adores the man
Youre jealous
Are you sure this wont hurt
Only if I slip
And you prefer me like this
Mhmm
If you want hairless maybe you should find a little boy
I want you
My brother thinks that anyone who hasnt been to war isnt a man He treats me as if Im a spoiled child Oh and youre not  the Knight of the Flowers How many wars have you fought in Oh and how much did your father spend on that armor of yours
Hold still
All I ever hear from Robert and Stannis is how Im not tough enough how I squirm at the sight of blood
You did vomit when that boys eye was knocked out in the melee
His eye was dangling out of the damn socket
He shouldnt have entered the melee if he didnt know how to fight
Easy for you to say Not everyone is such a gifted swordsman
Its not a gift No one gave it to me Im good because I work at it every day of my life since I could hold a stick
I could work at fighting all day every day and still never be as good as you
Yes well I guess well never know
Everywhere
Everywhere So how did it end up The Targaryen girl will die
It needs to be done unpleasant as it is Roberts rather tasteless about it Every time he talks about killing her I swear the table rises six inches
Its a shame he cant muster the same enthusiasm for his wife
He does have a deep abiding lust for her money You have to give it to the Lannisters they may be the most pompous ponderous cunts the gods ever suffered to walk the world but they do have outrageous amounts of money
I have an outrageous amount of money
Not as much as the Lannisters
But a lot more than you
Roberts threatening to take me hunting with him Last time we were out there for two weeks tramping through the trees in the rain day after day All so he can stick his spear into somethings flesh Oh but Robert loves his killing And hes the King
Hmm How did that ever happen
Because he loves his killing and he used to be good at it
Do you know who should be King
Be serious
I am My father could be your bank Ive never fought in a war before but Id fight for you
Im fourth in line
And where was Robert in the line of royal succession Joffrey is a monster Tommen is eight
Stannis
Stannis has the personality of a lobster
Hes still my older brother
What are you doing
Look at it
You cut me
Its just blood Weve all got it in us Sometimes a little spills If you become King youre going to see a lot of this You need to get used to it Go on Look People love you They love to serve you because youre kind to them They want to be near you
Youre willing to do what needs to be done but you dont gloat over it You dont love killing Where is it written that power is the sole province of the worst That thrones are only made for the hated and the feared You would be a wonderful King 
Im sorry your marriage to Ned Stark didnt work out You seemed so good together
Im glad I could do something to make you happy
Without a Hand everything will fall to pieces
I suppose this is where you tell me to give the job to your brother Jaime
No Hes not serious enough Ill say this for Ned Stark hes serious enough Was it really worth it Losing him this way
I dont know But I do know this if the Targaryen girl convinces her horselord husband to invade and the Dothraki horde crosses The Narrow Sea We wont be able to stop them
The Dothraki dont sail Every child knows that They dont have discipline They dont have armor They dont have siege weapons
Its a neat little trick you do you move your lips and your fathers voice comes out
Is my father wrong
Lets say Viserys Targaryen lands with forty thousand Dothraki screamers at his back We hole up in our castles a wise move Only a fool would meet the Dothraki in an open field They leave us in our castles They go from town to town looting and burning killing every man who cant hide behind a stone wall stealing all our crops and livestock enslaving all our women and children How long do the people of the Seven Kingdoms stand behind their absentee King their cowardly King hiding behind high walls When do the people decide that Viserys Targaryen is the rightful monarch after all
We still outnumber them
Which is the bigger number five or one
Five
Five one One army a real army united behind one leader with one purpose Our purpose died with the Mad King Now weve got as many armies as there are men with gold in their purse And everybody wants something different Your father wants to own the world Ned Stark wants to run away and bury his head in the snow
What do you want
We havent had a real fight in nine years Backstabbing doesnt prepare you for a fight And thats all the realm is now backstabbing and scheming and arselicking and moneygrubbing Sometimes I dont know what holds it together
Our marriage
Ah so here we sit seventeen years later holding it all together Dont you get tired
Every day
How long can hate hold a thing together
Well seventeen years is quite a long time
Yes it is
Yes it tis What was she like
Youve never asked about her not once Why not
At first just saying her name even in private felt like I was breathing life back into her I thought if I didnt talk about her shed just fade away for you When I realized that wasnt going to happen I refused to ask out of spite I didnt want to give you the satisfaction of thinking I cared enough to ask And eventually it became clear that my spite didnt mean anything to you as far as I could tell you actually enjoyed it
So why now
What harm could Lyanna Starks ghost do to either of us that we havent done to each other a hundred times over
You want to know the horrible truth I cant even remember what she looked like I only know she was the one thing I ever wanted Someone took her away from me and Seven Kingdoms couldnt fill the hole she left behind
I felt something for you once you know
I know
Even after we lost our first boy for quite a while actually Was it ever possible for us Was there ever a time ever a moment
No Does that make you feel better or worse
It doesnt make me feel anything 
She looks like him dont she my Lord She has his nose his black hair
Aye
Tell him when you see him my Lord If it please you Tell him how beautiful she is
I will
And tell him Ive been with no one else I swear it my Lord by the old gods and new I dont want no jewels or nothing just him ing was always good to me
When Jon Arryn came to visit you what did he want
He wasnt that sort of man my Lord He just wanted to know if the child was happy healthy
She looks healthy enough to me The girl shall want for nothing
Brothels make a much better investment than ship Ive found Whores rarely sink
What do you know of King Roberts bastards
Well he has more than you for a start
How many
Does it matter If you fuck enough women some of them will give you presents
And Jon Arryn tracked them all down Why
He was the Kings Hand Perhaps Robert wanted them looked after He was overcome with fatherly love
Come
Jory
My Lord
Such a small pack of wolves
Stay back Ser This is the Hand of the King
Was the Hand of the King Now Im not sure what he is Lord of somewhere very far away
Whats the meaning of this Lannister
Get back inside where its safe Im looking for my brother You remember my brother dont you Lord Stark Blond hair sharp tongue short man
I remember him well
It seems he had some trouble on the road You wouldnt know what happened to him would you
He was taken at my command to answer for his crimes
My Lords Ill bring the City Watch
Come Stark Id rather you die sword in hand
If you threaten my Lord again
Threaten As in Im going to open your Lord from balls to brains and see what Starks are made of
You kill me your brothers a dead man
Youre right Take him alive Kill his men
Your pardon your Grace
Do you know what your wife has done
She did nothing I did not command
Whod have thought she had it in her
By what right dare you lay hands on my blood
I am the Kings Hand
You were the Kings Hand
trying to keep the peace
You shall now be held accountable
Oh will both of you shut your mouths Catelyn will release Tyrion and youll make your peace with Jaime
He butchered my men
Lord Stark was returning drunk from a brothel when his men attacked Jaime
Quiet woman
Jaime has fled the city Give me leave to bring him back to justice
I took you for a king
Hold your tongue
Hes attacked my brother and abducted the other I should wear the armor and you the gown
I shall wear this like a badge of honor
Wear it in silence or Ill honor you again
See what she does to me My loving wife I should not have hit her That was not That was not kingly
If we dont act there will be a war
So tell your wife to return that little shit of an Imp to Kings Landing Shes had her fun now put an end to it You hear me Send a raven and put an end to it
And what about Jaime Lannister What about Jaime
Im half a kingdom in debt to his bloody father I dont know what happened between you and those yellowhaired shits I dont want to know This is what matters I cant rule the kingdoms if the Starks and the Lannisters are at each others throats so enough
As you command your Grace With your leave I will return to Winterfell and set matters straight
Piss on that Send a raven I want you to stay Im the king I get what I want I never loved my brothers A sad thing for a man to admit but its true You were the brother I chose Well talk when I return from the hunt
The hunt
Killing things clears my head Youll have to sit on the throne while Im away Youll hate it more than I do
The Targaryen girl
Seven hells Dont start with her again The girl will die and Ill hear no more of it Put on the badge And if you ever take it off again I swear to the Mother Ill pin the damn thing on Jaime Lannister 
Khaleesi
Oh Khaleesi
Youre hurt 
Not too fast
Come on Dancer
When are you gonna tell him
Not now
Blood for blood You need to make the Lannisters to pay for Jory and the others
Youre talking about war
Im talking about justice
Only the Lord of Winterfell can call in the bannermen and raise an army
A Lannister put his spear through your fathers leg ingslayer rides to Casterly Rock where no one can touch
You want me to march on Casterly Rock
Youre not a boy anymore They attacked your father Theyve already started the war Its your duty to represent your House when your father cant
And its not your duty because its not your House
Wheres Bran
I dont know Its not my House
Robb
All alone in the deep dark woods
Im not alone my brother is with me
I dont see him Got him hidden under your cloak
Oh thats a pretty pin Silver
Well take the pin And the horse Get down Be quick about it
I cant The saddle the straps
Whats wrong with you You some kind of cripple
Im Brandon Stark of Winterfell and if you dont let me be Ill have you all killed
Cut his little cock off and stuff it in his mouth
the boys worth nothing dead Benjen Starks own blood Think what Mance would give us
Piss on Mance rayder and piss on the North Were going as far south as south goes There aint no white walkers down in Dorne
Drop the knife Let him go and Ill let you liveOne of the Wildlings storms at Robb who evades an axe attack Robb counters slicing the Wildlings throat Osha charges Robb who tosses her spins her around by her hair He fights off and kills the other Wildling The Wilding in charge has Bran off of his horse with a knife at his throat meanwhile Robb has Osha and a knife to her throat
Robb
Shut up Drop the blade
No dont
Do it
Are you all right
Yes it doesnt hurt
Tough little lad In the Iron Islands youre not a man until youve killed your first enemy Well done
Have you lost your mind What if youd missed
He would have killed you and cut Brans throat
You dont have the right
To what to save your brothers life It was the only thing to do so I did it
What about her
Give me my life my lord and Im yours
Well keep her alive 
Mord Turnkey
Dwarf man making noise
How would you like to be rich
Dwarf man still making noise
My family is rich We have gold lots of gold Im prepared to give you lots of gold
No gold
Well I dont have it here
No gold Fuck off 
I dont want to practice today
No
They killed Jory My father is hurt I dont care about stupid wooden swords
You are troubled
Yes
Good Trouble is the perfect time for training When you are dancing in the meadow with your dolls and kittens this is not when fighting happens
I dont like dolls and k
Youre not here Youre with your trouble If youre with your trouble when fighting happens
More trouble for you Just so How can you be quick as a snake or as quiet as a shadow when you are somewhere else You are fearing for your father hmm That is right Do you pray to the gods
The old and the new
There is only one god And his name is death And there is only one thing we say to death Not today 
She has to eat a whole heart I hope that wasnt my horse
Shes doing well
Shell never keep it down
Tell me what she is saying
The prince is riding I have heard the thunder of the hooves Swift as the wind he rides His enemies will cower before him and their wives will weep tears of blood
Shes going to have a boy
He wont be a real Targaryen He wont be a true dragon
The stallion who mounts the world The stallion is the khal of khals He shall unite the people into a single khalasar All the people of the world will be his herd
A prince rides inside me And he shall be called Rhaego
They love her
She truly is a queen today
Dont let them see you carrying a sword in Vaes Dothrak You know the law
Its not my law
They dont belong to you
Whatever is hers is also mine
Once perhaps
If I sell one egg Ill have enough to buy a ship Two eggs a ship and an army
And you have all three
I need a large army Im the last hope of a dynasty Mormont The greatest dynasty this world has ever seen on my shoulders since I was five years old and no one has ever given me what they gave to her in that tent Never Not a piece of it How can I carry what I need to carry without it Hmm Who can rule without wealth or fear or love Oh you stand there all nobility and honor You dont think I see you looking at my little sister hmm Dont think I know what you want I dont care You can have her She can be queen of the savages and dine on the finest bloody horseparts and you can dine on whichever parts of her you like But let me go
You can go but you cant have the eggs
You swore an oath to me Does loyalty mean nothing to you
It means everything to me
And yet here you stand
And here I stand 
Mord Mord Mord Mord Mord
Noise again
About the gold
No gold
Listen to me Listen to me Sometimes possession is an abstract concept When they captured me they took my purse but the gold is still mine
Where
Where I dont know where but when they free me
You want free Go be free
Have you ever heard the phrase Rich as a Lannister Of course you have Youre a smart man You know who the Lannisters are I am a Lannister Tyrion son of Tywin And of course you have also heard the phrase a Lannister always pays his debts If you deliver a message from me to Lady Arryn I will be in your debt I will owe you gold If you deliver the message and I live which I very much intend to do
What message
Tell her I wish to confess my crimes
You wish to confess your crimes
Yes my lady I do my lady
Skycells always break them Speak Imp Meet your gods as an honest man
Where do I begin my lords and ladies Im a vile man I confess it My crimes and sins are beyond counting I have lied and cheated gambled and whored Im not particularly good at violence but Im good at convincing others to do violence for me You want specifics I suppose When I was seven I saw a servant girl bathing in the river I stole her robe She was forced to return to the castle naked and in tears I close my eyes I can still see her tits bouncing When I was ten I stuffed my uncles boots with goatshit When confronted with my crime I blamed a squire Poor boy was flogged and I escaped justice When I was twelve I milked my eel into a pot of turtle stew I flogged the oneeyed snake I skinned my sausage I made the bald man cry into the turtle stew which I do believe my sister ate At least I hope she did I once brought a jackass and a honeycomb into a brothel
Silence
What happened next
What do you think youre doing
Confessing my crimes
Lord Tyrion you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed and of conspiring to murder my sisters husband Lord Jon Arryn the Hand of the King
Oh Im very sorry I dont know anything about all that
Youve had your little joke I trust you enjoyed it Mord take him back to the dungeon But this time find a smaller cell with a steeper floor
Is this how justice is done in the Vale you accuse me of crimes I deny them so you throw me in a cell to freeze and starve Where is the Kings Justice Im accused and demand a trial
If youre tried and found guilty then by the kings own laws you will pay with your life
I understand the law
We have no executioner in the Eyrie Life is more elegant here Open the Moon Door
You want a trial my Lord Lannister Very well My son will listen to whatever you have to say and you will hear his judgement Then you will leave by one door or the other
No need to bother Lord Robin I demand a trial by combat
You have that right
My lady I beg the honor Let me be your champion
The honor should be mine For the love I bore your lord husband let me avenge his death
Ill fight for you my Lady
Itll be my honor
The honor should be mine
Make the bad man fly
Youre quiet Did you want to avenge my husband
With all my heart my Lady But the Imp is half my size It would be shameful to slaughter such a man and call it justice
Agreed
You demanded a trial by combat
Now I demand a champion I have that right same as you
My Lady I would gladly fight the Imps champion for you
I wouldnt be too glad ser I name my brother Jaime Lannister
ingslayer is hundreds of miles from here
Send a raven for him Im happy to wait
The trial will be today
Do I have a volunteer
Anyone Anyone
I think that we can assume that no one is willing
Ill stand for the dwarf 
More wine your Grace
Oh what was I saying
A simpler time
It was It was Youre too young to remember Wasnt it Selmy
It was your Grace
The enemy was right there in the open vicious as you like all but sending you a bloody invitation Nothing like today
Sounds exhilarating
Exhilarating yes Not as exhilarating as those balls and masquerades you like to throw You ever fucked a Riverlands girl
Once I think
You think I think youd remember Back in our day you werent a real man until you fucked a girl from each of the Seven Kingdoms and the Riverlands We called it making the eight
Those were some lucky girls
You ever make the eight Barristan
I dont believe so your Grace
Those were the days
What days were those The ones where half of Westeros fought the other half and millions died Or before that when the Mad King slaughtered women and babies because the voices in his head told him they deserved it Or way before that when dragons burned whole cities to the ground
Easy boy You might be my brother but youre speaking to the King
I suppose it was all rather heroic If you were drunk enough and had some poor Riverlands whore to shove your price inside and make the eight
More wine your Grace 
They burned most everything in the Riverlands our fields our granaries our homes They took our women and then they took em again When they was done they butchered them as if they was animals They covered our children in pitch and lit them on fire
Brigands most likely
They werent thieves they didnt steal nothing They even left something behind your Grace
Its the Kings Hand youre addressing not the king The king is hunting
Fish The sigil of House Tully Isnt that your wifes House Tully my Lord Hand
These men were they flying a sigil A banner
None your Hand The one who was leading them Taller by a foot than any man Ive ever met saw him cut the blacksmith saw him take the head off a horse with a single swing of his sword
That sounds like someone we know The Mountain
Youre describing Ser Gregor Clegane
Why should Ser Gregor turn brigand The man is an anointed knight
Ive heard him called Tywin Lannisters mad dog Im sure you have as well Can you think of any reason the Lannisters might possibly have for being angry with your wife
If the Lannisters were to order attacks on villages under the kings protection it would be
It would be almost as brazen as attacking the Hand of the King in the streets of the capital
Wel
I cannot give you back your homes or restore your dead to life But perhaps I can give you justice in the name of our king Robert Lord Beric Dondarrion
You shall have the command Assemble 100 men and ride to Ser Gregors keep
As you command
In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon the First of his Name King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm I charge you to bring the kings justice to the false knight Gregor Clegane and all those who shared in his crimes I denounce him and attaint him I strip him of all ranks and titles of all lands and holdings and sentence him to death
My lord This This is a drastic action It would be better to wait for King Roberts return
My Lord
Send a raven to Casterly Rock Inform Tywin Lannister that he has been summoned to court to answer for the crimes of his bannermen He will arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the crown and a traitor to the realm
A bold move my Lord and admirable But is it wise to yank the lions tail Tywin Lannister is the richest man in all the Seven Kingdoms Gold wins wars not soldiers
Then how come Robert is king and not Tywin Lannister 
Is it over
You dont fight with honor
No
Can I make the little man fly now
Not this little man This little man is going home I believe you have something of mine
A Lannister always pays his debts 
You wear your hair like a real southern lady now
Well why shouldnt I Were in the south
Its important to remember where you come from Im not sure your mother would like these new styles
My mother isnt from the North
Im aware of that
Why do you care Do you even have hair under there
Yes I have hair
Ive never seen it
Would you like to
No Where are you from anyway the north or the south
I come from a very small village in
Oh wait I just realized I dont care
Sansa
Septa
Now you are being rude
My prince
My prince
My lady I fear I have behaved monstrously the past few weeks With your permission
Its beautiful Like the one your mother wears
Youll be queen one day its only fitting that you should look the part Will you forgive me for my rudeness
Theres nothing to forgive
Youre my lady One day well be married in the throne room Lords and ladies from all over the Seven Kingdoms will come from the last hearth in the North to the salt shore of the south And you will be queen over all of them Ill never disrespect you again Ill never be cruel to you again Do you understand me Youre my lady now from this day until my last day 
Stop Stop What are you doing
Going to Kings Landing
In a turnip cart
Ill find a ship heading south in White Harbor
And you can afford that
Some of my friends are more generous than others
Theres a thousand girls like you in Kings Landing
Ill have lots of company
Yes youll be very popular until some fat lord comes to visit with a big belly and a little prick and he cant get it up so he knocks all your teeth out
And what will happen to me if I stay here Will I become Lady Greyjoy Mistress of the Iron Islands
Dont be a fool
I hear Jaime Lannister attacked Lord Stark in the streets of Kings Landing Every man for a hundred miles will be marching off to war soon and most of them will never come back theres nothing more for me here Lets go Steffon
Let me see it one more time
See what
Im going to miss you
I know 
Im sending you both back to Winterfell
What
Listen
What about Joffrey
Are you dying because of your leg Is that why youre sending us home
What No
Please Father Please dont
You cant Ive got my lessons with Syrio Im finally getting good
This isnt a punishment I want you back in Winterfell for your own safety
Cant we take Syrio back with us
Who cares about your stupid dancing teacher I cant go Im supposed to marry Prince Joffrey I love him and Im meant to be his queen and have his babies
Seven hells
When youre old enough Ill make you a match with someone whos worthy of you someone whos brave and gentle and strong
I dont want someone brave and gentle and strong I want him Hell be the greatest king that ever was a golden lion and Ill give him sons with beautiful blond hair
The lions not his sigil idiot Hes a stag like his father
He is not Hes nothing like that old drunk king
Go on girls Get your septa and start packing your things
Wait
Come on
Its not fair
Lord Orys Baratheon black of hair Axel Baratheon black of hair Lyonel Baratheon black of hair Steffon Baratheon black of hair Robert Baratheon black of hair Joffrey Baratheon goldenhaired 
Daenerys Wheres my sister
Stop him
Where is she Im here for the feast The whores feast
Come
Get your hands off me No one touches the dragon
 Im here for the feast
Khal Drogo says there is a place for you Back there
That is no place for a king
You are no king
Keep away from me
Viserys please
There she is
Put the sword down Theyll kill us all
They cant kill us They cant shed blood in their sacred city But I can I want what I came for I want the crown he promised me He bought you But he never paid for you
Tell him I want what was bargained for or Im taking you back He can keep the baby Ill cut it out and leave it for him
Whats he saying
He says yes You shall have a golden crown that men shall tremble to behold
That was all I wanted Wwhat was promised
No You cannot touch me I am the dragon I am the dragon I want my crown Ahh
Look away Khaleesi
No
No Dany Dany tell them make them You cant
Dany please
A crown for a king
Khaleesi
He was no dragon Fire cannot kill a dragon
Summoned to court to answer for the crimes of your bannerman Gregor Clegane the Mountain Uh arrive within the fortnight or be branded an enemy of the Crown Poor Ned Stark Brave man terrible judgment
Attacking him was stupid
Lannisters dont act like fools Are you gonna say something clever Go on say something clever
Catelyn Stark took my brother
Why is he still alive
Tyrion
Ned Stark
One of our men interfered speared him through the leg before I could finish him
Why is he still alive
It wouldnt have been clean
Clean
You spend too much time worrying about what other people think of you
I could care less what anyone thinks of me
Now thats what you want people to think of you
Its the truth
When you hear them whispering Kingslayer behind your back doesnt it bother you
Of course it bothers me
The lion doesnt concern himself with the opinions of the sheep I suppose I should be grateful that your vanity got in the way of your recklessness Im giving you half of our forces 30000 men You will bring them to Catelyn Starks girlhood home and remind her that Lannisters pay their debts
I didnt realize you placed such a high value on my brothers life
Hes a Lannister He might be the lowest of the Lannisters but hes one of us And every day that he remains a prisoner the less our name commands respect
So the lion does concern himself with the opinions of
No its not an opinion its a fact If another House can seize one of our own and hold him captive with impunity we are no longer a House to be feared Your mothers dead Before long Ill be dead And you and your brother and your sister and all of her children All of us dead all of us rotting in the ground Its the family name that lives on Its all that lives on Not your personal glory not your honor but family Do you understand
Hmm Youre blessed with abilities that few men possess You are blessed to belong to the most powerful family in the kingdoms And you are still blessed with youth And what have you done with these blessings huh Youve served as a glorified bodyguard for two kings One a madman the other a drunk The future of our family will be determined in these next few months We could establish a dynasty that will last a thousand years Or we could collapse into nothing as the Targaryens did I need you to become a man you were always meant to be Not next year Not tomorrow Now
Youre in pain
Ive had worse my lady
Perhaps its time to go home
The South doesnt seem to agree with you
I know the truth Jon Arryn died for
Do you Lord Stark Is that why you called me here to pose me riddles
Has he done this before
Jaime would have killed him
My brother is worth a thousand of your friend
Your brother Or your lover
The Targaryens wed brothers and sisters for 300 years to keep bloodlines pure
Jaime and I are more than brother and sister We shared a womb We came into this world together We belong together
My son saw you with him
Do you love your children
With all my heart
No more than I love mine
And they are all Jaimes
Thank the Gods In the rare event that Robert leaves his whores for long enough to stumble drunk into my bed I finish him off in other ways In the morning he doesnt remember
Youve always hated him
Hated him I worshiped him Every girl in the Seven Kingdoms dreamed of him but he was mine by oath And when I finally saw him on our wedding day in the Sept of Baelor lean and fierce and blackbearded it was the happiest moment of my life Then that night he crawled on top of me stinking of wine and did what he did what little he could do and whispered in my ear Lyanna Your sister was a corpse and I was a living girl and he loved her more than me
When the King returns from his hunt Ill tell him the truth You must be gone by then You and your children I will not have their blood on my hands Go as far away as you can with as many men as you can Because wherever you go Roberts wrath will follow you
And what of my wrath Lord Stark You should have taken the realm for yourself Jaime told me about the day Kings Landing fell He was sitting in the Iron Throne and you made him give it up All you needed to do was climb the steps yourself Such a sad mistake
Ive made many mistakes in my life but that wasnt one of them
Oh but it was When you play the Game of Thrones you win or you die There is no middle ground
Come here Oh yes oh Oh yes yes yes
No no no no Is that what they teach you up in the North And you wherever youre from do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound Either of you understand a thing that Im saying
Yes My Lord
Lets start over shall we You be the man and you be the woman Well go ahead Slowly Youre not fooling them They just paid you They know what you are They know its all just an act Your job is to make them forget what they know That takes time You need to Ease into it Go ahead Ease into it Hes winning you over in spite of yourself Youre starting to like this He wants to believe you Hes enjoyed his cock since he was old enough to play with it Why shouldnt you He knows hes better than other men Hes always known it deep down inside Now he has proof Hes so good hes reaching something deep inside of you that no one even knew was there Overcoming your very nature
Why dont you join us My Lord
Im saving myself for another
What she doesnt know wont hurt her
A stupid saying What we dont know is usually what gets us killed
She must be very beautiful
No not really Impeccable bloodlines though
I do believe my lords in love
For many years Most of my life really Play with her ass And she loved me too I was her little confidant her plaything She could tell me anything anything at all She told me about all the horses that she liked The castle she wanted to live in and the man that she wanted to marry A northerner with a jaw like an anvil So I challenged him to a duel I mean why not Id read all the stories The little hero always beats the big villain in all the stories In the end she wouldnt even let him kill me Hes just a boy  she said Please dont hurt him So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by and off they went
Is she still married to him
Oh no He got himself killed before the wedding And she ended up with his brother an even more impressive specimen She loves him Im afraid And why wouldnt she I mean who could compare to him Hes just so good Do you know what I learned losing that duel I learned that Ill never win Not that way Thats their game their rules Im not going to fight them Im going to fuck them Thats what I know Thats what I am And only by admitting what we are can we get what we want
And what do you want
Oh everything my dear Everything there is Now wash yourselves Both of you are working tonight Hmm
Youre a very lucky girl Do you know that Where I come from we dont show mercy to criminals Where I come from if someone like you attacked a little lord at low tide wed lay you on your back on the beach your hands and feet chained to four stakes The sea would come in closer and closer Youd see death creeping toward you a few inches at a time
Where is it you come from
The Iron Islands
They far away
Youve never heard of the Iron Islands
Trust me youve never heard where Im from neither
Trust me My Lord Youre not living in the wilderness anymore In civilized lands you refer to your betters by their proper titles
And whats that
Lord
Why
Why What do you mean why My father is Balon Greyjoy Lord of the Iron Islands
Whats that got to do with you If your fathers lord how can you be lord too
I will be lord after my father
So youre not lord now
No you You having a go at me Is that it
I just dont understand how you Southerners do things
Im not a Southerner
Youre from South of the wall That makes you a Southerner to me
Youre an impudent little wench arent you
Couldnt say My Lord Dont know what impunent means
Impudent It means rude Disrespectful Do you want to lose that chain
 The lady is our guest
I thought she was our prisoner
Are the two mutually exclusive in your experience
Chances are I wont be nearby the next time that happens
Im used to worse than him
Im used to men who could chew that boy up and pick their teeth with his bones
Why did you come here
Didnt mean to come here Meant to get much further South than this As far South as South goes before the long night comes
Why What are you afraid of
Theres things that sleep in the day and hunt at night
Owls and Shadowcats and
Im not talking about Owls and Shadowcats
The things you speak of theyve been gone for thousands of years
They wasnt gone old man They was sleeping And they aint sleeping no more
I miss girls Not even talking to them I never talked to them Just looking at them hearing them giggle Dont you miss girls Riders The horn We have to blow the horn
Why is he alone
One blast for a Ranger returning two for Wildlings three for
Theres no rider
Whoa boy whoa
Thats my Uncle Benjens horse Wheres my Uncle
Ned Its Robert We were hunting a boar
I should have spent more time with you shown you how to be a man I was never meant to be a father Go on You dont want to see this
My fault Too much wine missed my thrust It stinks It stinks like death Dont think I cant smell it I paid the bastard back Ned I drove my knife right through his brain You ask them if I didnt Ask them I want the funeral feast to be the biggest the Kingdoms ever saw And I want everyone to taste the boar that got me Now leave us the lot of you I need to talk to Ned
Robert my sweet
Out all of you
You damned fool
Paper and ink on the table write down what I say In the name of Robert of the House Baratheon first of you know how it goes Fill in the damn titles I hereby command Eddard of House Stark titles titles To serve as Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm upon my death To rule in my stead until my son Joffrey comes of age Give it over
Give it to the council after Im dead At least theyll say I did this right this one thing Youll rule now Youll hate it worse than I did but youll do it well The girl Daenerys You were right Varys Littlefinger my brother Worthless No one to tell me no but you Only you Let her live Stop it if its not too late
I will
And my son Help him Ned Make him better than me
Ill Ill do everything I can to honor your memory
My memory King Robert Baratheon murdered by a pig Give me something for the pain and let me die
Give him milk of the poppy
He was reeling from the wine He commanded us to step aside but I failed him
No man could have protected him from himself
I wonder Ser Barristan who gave the king this wine
His squire from the kings own skin
His squire The Lannister boy
Such a dutiful boy to make sure his Grace did not lack refreshment I do hope the poor lad does not blame himself
His Grace has had a change of heart concerning Daenerys Targaryen Whatever arrangements you made unmake them At once
Im afraid those birds have flownThe girl is likely dead already
The stallion who mounts the world has no need for iron chairs
According to the prophecy the stallions will ride to the ends of the world
The earth ends at the black salt sea No horse can cross the poison water
The earth does not end at the sea there are many dirts beyond the sea The dirt where I was born
Not dirt Lands
Lands yes There are thousands of ships in the free cities Wooden horses that fly across the sea
Lets speak no more of wooden horses and iron chairs
Its not a chair Its a
Throne
A chair for a King to sit upon or a Queen
A King does not need a chair to sit upon He only needs a horse
Cant you help me make him understand
The Dothraki do things in their own time for their own reasons Have patience Khaleesi We will go home I promise you
My brother was a fool I know but he was the rightful heir to the Seven Kingdoms Have I said something funny Ser
Forgive me Khaleesi but your ancestor Aegon the Conqueror didnt seize six of the kingdoms because they were his right He had no right to them He seized them because he could
And because he had dragons
Ah well having a few dragons makes things easier
You dont believe it
Have you ever seen a dragon Khaleesi I believe what my eyes and ears report As for the rest It was 300 years ago Who knows what really happened Now if youll pardon me Ill seek out the merchant Captain see if he has any letters for me
Well Ill come with you
No no dont trouble yourself Enjoy the market Ill rejoin you soon enough
Psst Jorah the Andal The spider sends his greetings and his congratulations A royal pardon You can go home now
Virzetha gizikhven Mra qora Mra qora
My son already has his name but Ill try your summerwine Just a taste
My Lady you are from Westeros
You have the honor of addressing Daenerys of the House Targaryen Khaleesi of the riding men and princess of the Seven Kingdoms
Princess
Rise Id still like to taste that wine
That Dornish swill Not worthy of a princess I have a dry red from the Arbor Nectar of the Gods Let me give you a cask Uh a gift
You honor me Ser
The honor the honor is all mine
Huhuh huhuh
You know there are many in your homeland that pray for your return princess
I hope to repay your kindness someday
Huh
Is something wrong
I have a thirst Open it
The wine is for the Khaleesi Its not for the likes of you
Open it
Pour
It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich without at least giving it time to breathe
Do as he says
As the princess commands
Sweet isnt it Can you smell the fruit Ser Taste it My Lord Tell me that that is not the finest wine that has ever touched your tongue
You first
Me Im afraid I am not worthy of the vintage Besides it is a poor wine merchant who would drink up his own wares
You will drink
Khaleesi Stop him
Come Not much really But theres food
Here you begin anew A man of The Nights Watch lives his life for the realm Not for a king or a lord or the honor of this house or that house Not for gold nor glory nor a womans love But for the realm And all the people in it Youve all learned the words of the vow Think carefully before you say them The penalty for desertion is death You can take your vows here tonight at sunset Do any of you still keep the old Gods
I do my lord
Youll want to take your vow before a heart tree as your Uncle did
Yes my lord
Youll find a Weirwood a mile North of the Wall And your old Gods too maybe
my lord might I go as well
Does house Tarly keep the old Gods
No my lord I was named in the light of the Seven as my father was and his father before himAlliser ThorneL Why would you forsake the Gods of your father and your house
The Nights Watch is my house now The Seven have never answered my prayers Perhaps the old Gods will
As you wish lad Youve all been assigned an order according to our needs and your strengths Halder to the builders Pyp to the stewards Toad to the builders Grenn to the Rangers Samwell to the stewards Matthar to the Rangers Dareon to the stewards Balian to the Rangers Rast to the Rangers Jon to the stewards Rancer to the builders Echiel to the builders Gordo to the stewards Niko to the Rangers Escan to the Rangers Vorkoy to the builders Joby to the stables Mink to the kitchens Allo to the builders Nelugo to the Rangers May all the Gods preserve you
Rangers with me
Builders
Samwell you will assist me in the rookery and library Pyp you will report to Bowen Marsh in the kitchens Luke report to oneeyed Joe in the stables Dareon we are sending you to Eastwatch Present yourself to Borcas when you arrive Make no comment about his nose  Lord Commander Mormont has requested you for his personal steward
Will I serve the Lord Commanders meals and fetch hot water for his bath
Certainly And keep a fire burning in his chambers Change his sheets and blankets daily and do everything else the Lord Commander requires of you
Do you take me for a servant
We took you for a man of The Nights Watch But perhaps we were wrong in that
May I go
As you wish
Jon wait Dont you see what theyre doing
I see Ser Allisers revenge thats all He wanted it and he got it Stewards are nothing but maids Im a better swordsman and rider than any of you Its not fair
Fair I was singing for a high lord at Acorn Hall when he put his hand on my leg and he wanted to see my cock I pushed him away and he said hed have my hands cut off for stealing their silver So now Im here At the end of the world with no one to sing for but old men and little shits like you Ill never see my family again Ill never be inside a woman again So dont tell me about fair
I thought you were caught stealing a wheel of cheese for your starving sister
You think I was gonna tell a bunch of strangers that a high lord tried to grab my cock
Could you sing me a song Pyp Id like to hear a song
Now listen to me The old man is the Lord Commander of The Nights Watch Youll be with him day and night Yes youll clean his clothesBut youll also take his letters attend him at meetings squire for him in battle Youll know everything be part of everything And he asked for you himself He wants to groom you for command
I just I always wanted to be a Ranger
I always wanted to be a Wizard What No Im serious So youll stay and say your words with me
She wont care Give me an hour and I can put a hundred swords at your command
And what should I do with a hundred swords
Strike Tonight while the castle sleeps We must get Joffrey away from his mother and into our custody Protector of the Realm or no he who holds the King holds the Kingdom Every moment you delay gives Cersei another moment to prepare By the time Robert dies it will be too late for the both of us
What about Stannis
Saving the Seven Kingdoms from Cersei and delivering them to Stannis You have odd notions about protecting the realm
Stannis is your older brother
This isnt about the bloody line of succession That didnt matter when you rebelled against the Mad King It shouldnt matter now Whats best for the Kingdoms Whats best for the people we rule We all know what Stannis is He inspires no love or loyalty Hes not a King I am
Stannis is a commander Hes led men into war twice He destroyed the Greyjoy fleet
Yes hes a good soldier Everyone knows that So was Robert
Do you still believe good soldiers make good kings
I will not dishonor Roberts last hours by shedding blood in his halls and dragging frightened children from their beds
You will sail to dragonstone tonight You will place this in the hand of Stannis Baratheon Not his steward not his Captain of the guard and not his wife Only Stannis himself
Yes My Lord
Now leave us
My Lord protector
ing has no true born sons Joffrey and Tommen are Jaime Lannisters bastards
So when the King dies
The throne passes to his brother Lord Stannis
So it would seem Unless
There is no unless He is the rightful heir Nothing can change that
And he cannot take the throne without your help You would be wise to deny it to him and to make sure Joffrey succeeds
Do you have a shred of honor
You are now Hand of the King and Protector of the Realm All of the power is yours You need only reach out and take it Make peace with the Lannisters Release the Imp Wed your daughter to Joffrey We have plenty of time to get rid of Stannis And if Joffrey seems likely to cause problems when he comes into his throne we simply reveal his little secret and seat Lord Renly there instead
We
Youll need someone to share these burdens I assure you my price would be modest
What you suggest is treason
Only if we lose
Make peace with the Lannisters you say With the people who tried to murder my boy
No I wont do it
So it will be Stannis and war
There is no other choice He is the heir
So why did you call me here Not for my wisdom clearly
You promised Catelyn you would help me The Queen has a dozen knights and a hundred menatarms Enough to overwhelm what remains of my household guard I need the gold cloaks The City Watch is 2000 strong and sworn to defend the Kings peace
Look at you You know what you want me to do You know it has to be done but its not honorable so the words stick in your throat When the Queen proclaims one King and the Hand proclaims another whose peace do the Gold Cloaks protect Who do they follow The man who pays them
I thought hed leave me alone now that my brother is goneHe will never leave you alone If you ride to darkest Asshai his assassins will follow you If you sailed all the way to the Basilisk Isles his spies would tell him He will never abandon the hunt Youre a Targaryen The last Targaryen Your son will have Targaryen blood with 40000 riders behind him
He will not have my son
Moon of my life Are you hurt
Jorah the Andal I heard what you did Choose any horse you wish it is yoursI make this gift to you And to my son the stallion who will mount the world I will also pledge a gift
Liar
You condemn yourself with your own mouth Lord Stark Ser Barristan seize this traitor
Ser Barristan is a good man a loyal man Do him no harm
You think he stands alone
Kill him Kill all of them I command it
Commander Take the Queen and her children into custody Escort them back to the royal apartments and keep them there under guard
Men of the Watch
I want no bloodshed Tell your men to lay down their swords No one needs to die
Now
Yah Left high left low
Right low lunge right
If you break anything the Septa will have my head What is
Your sister knew perfectly well we were to leave today How she could forget
She didnt forget Shes with her dancing master Shes with him every morning She always comes back with scrapes and bruises Shes so clumsy
Hush Go back to your room Bar the doors and do not open them for anyone you do not know
What is it Whats happening
Do as I told you Run
This way Left right Rah Now you are dead
You said right but you went left
And now you are a dead girl
Only cause you lied
My tongue lied My eyes shouted the truth You were not seeing
I was so I watched but you
Watching is not seeing dead girl The seeing the true seeing that is the heart of swordplay
Arya Stark come with us Your father wants to see you
And why is it that Lord Eddard is sending Lannister men in place of his own I am wondering
Mind your place dancing master This is no concern of yours
My father wouldnt send you
And I dont have to go with you if I dont want
Take her
Are you men or snakes that you would threaten a child
Get out of my way little man
I am Syrio Forel
Foreign bastard
And you will be speaking to me with more respect
Kill the Braavosi Bring the girl
Arya child we are done with dancing for the day Run to your father
Bloody oafs
Be gone now Arya
Come with me Run
The first sword of Braavos does not run
What do we say to the God of death
Not today
Go
Not today Not today Back on the other side of the Red Keep Sansa runs on but is stopped by a familiar face
Stay away from me Ill tell my father Ill Ill tell the Queen
Who do you think sent me
Needle
There she is
What do you want
I want you wolf girl Come here
Leave me be My fathers a lord Hell reward you
Shell reward me the Queen
Stay away
Lord Stark you must be thirsty
Varys
I promise you it isnt poisoned Why is it no one ever trusts the eunuch Not so much My Lord I would save the rest if I were you Hide it Men have been known to die of thirst in these cells
What about my daughters
The younger one seems to have escaped the castle Even my little birds cannot find her
And Sansa
Still engaged to Joffrey Cersei will keep her close The rest of your household though all dead it grieves me to say I do so hate the sight of blood
You watched my men being slaughtered and did nothing
And would again My Lord I was unarmed unarmored and surrounded by Lannister swords When you look at me do you see a hero What madness led you to tell the Queen you had learned the truth about Joffreys birth
The madness of mercy That she might save her children
Ah the children It is always the innocents who suffer It wasnt the wine that killed Robert nor the boar The wine slowed him down and the boar ripped him open but it was your mercy that killed the King I trust you know you are a dead man Lord Eddard
The Queen cant kill me Cat holds her brother
The wrong brother sadly And lost to her Your wife has let the Imp slip through her fingers
If thats true then slit my throat and be done with it
Not today My Lord
Tell me something Varys Who do you truly serve
The Realm My Lord Someone must
Its Othor without a doubt
The other one is Jafer Flowers My Lord less the hand the wolf tore off
Any sign of Benjen or the rest of his party
Just these two My Lord Been dead awhile Id say
Mmm
The smell
What smell
There is none If theyd be dead for a long time wouldnt there be rot
We should burn them
Snows not wrong My Lord Fire will do for them The Wildling way
I want Maester Aemon to examine them first You may be a coward Tarly but youre not stupid Get them inside
You heard him
Lord Commander Maester Aemon awaits you in his chambers A raven from Kings Landing
Come on move em out
Bring me a horn of ale Snow and pour one for yourself ing is dead
Is there any word of my father
Sit Lord Stark has been charged with treason They say he conspired with Roberts brothers to deny the throne to Prince Joffrey
I hope youre not thinking of doing anything stupid Your duty lies here now
My sisters were in Kings Landing too
Im sure theyll be treated gently
Your father has proved to be an awful traitor dear
King Roberts body was still warm when Lord Eddard began plotting to steal Joffreys rightful throne
He wouldnt do that He knows how much I love Joffrey He wouldnt Please Your Grace theres been a mistake Send for my father Hell tell you the King was his friend
Sansa sweetling you are innocent of any wrong We know that Yet you are the daughter of a traitor How can I allow you to marry my son
A child born of a traitors seed is no fit consort for our King She is a sweet thing now Your Grace but in 10 years who knows what treasons she may hatch
No Im not Ill be a good wife to him youll seeIll be a Queen just like you I promise I wont hatch anything
The girl is innocent Your Grace She should be given a chance to prove her loyalty
Little dove you must write to Lady Catelyn and your brother the eldest Whats his name
Robb
Word of your fathers arrest will reach him soon no doubt Best it comes from you If you would help your father urge your brother to keep the Kings peace Tell him to come to Kings Landing and swear his fealty to Joffrey
If if I could see my father talk to him about
You disappoint me child We have told you of your fathers treason Why would you want to speak to a traitor
I only meant that what will happen to him
That depends
On on what
On your brother And on you
Treason Sansa wrote this
It is your sisters hand but the Queens words You are summoned to Kings Landing to swear fealty to the new King
Joffrey puts my father in chains now he wants his ass kissed
This is a royal command My Lord If you should refuse to obey
I wont refuse His Grace summons me to Kings Landing Ill go to Kings Landing But not alone Call the banners
Im hungry
Hush now darling You just ate
You will not support us then Do I understand you correctly
But Im hungry
Soon love soon Youre always welcome here sister But if youre asking me to send men from the Vale to fight
That is what I ask
Go on sweet Time for your bath Ill feed you after
If you fear for the safety of your son
Of course I fear for the safety of my son Are you an idiot They killed my husband You say they shoved your boy from a window These people will do anything
And that is why we have to stop them
The knights of the Vale will stay in the Vale where they belong to protect their Lord beserk 
From here it might be best if Bronn and I continue alone
Best for Tyrion son of Tywin Not best for me If the half man betrays us Shagga son of Dolf will cut off his manhood
And feed it to the goats yes All right then Time to meet my father Kevan Lannister Tyrion
Uncle Father
The rumors of your demise were unfounded
Sorry to disappoint you
And who are these Companions of yours
This is Shagga Son of Dolf Chieftain of the Stone Crows Timett Son of Timett ruler of the Burned Men This fair maid is Chella daughter of Cheyk leader of the Black Ears And here we have son of
You wouldnt know him
May I present My Lord Father Tywin son of Tytos of House Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West Kind of you to go to war for me
You left us no choice The honor of the House was at stake Your brother would never have submitted to capture so meekly
We have our differences Jaime and I Hes braver Im better looking
Hes been covering himself in glory
Jaime smashed the River Lords at the Golden Tooth and now lays siege to Riverrun Catelyn Starks homeland
And the Starks Lord Eddard
Is our hostage He will lead no armies from his dungeon cell
How did my sweet sister persuade the King to imprison his dear friend Ned
Robert Baratheon is dead Joffrey rules in Kings Landing
My sister rules you mean
Starks son has called his banners He moves south with a strong host
A green boy One taste of battle and hell run back to Winterfell wi his tail between his legs
Maybe Though the boy does have a certain belligerence Youd like him While were on the subject of war I made promises to my friends here and a Lannister always pays his debts We shall require 3000 helms and shields plus swords pikes gorgets maces
If it please My Lord Ser Addam bids me report that the Northmen have crossed the neck
The wolf rushes into the lions jaws So be it Kevan command the drummers beat assembly And send word to Jaime that I am moving against Robb Stark
At once My Lord
It is said that the men of the Mountain clans are great warriors Ride with me against my enemies and you shall have all my son promised you and more
Only if the half man fights with us Until we hold the steel he pledged us the little lions life is ours
The scouts report Lord Tywin moves north We need to get him on broken ground put his Knights at a disadvantage
No we need to get around him and break Jaime Lannisters siege of Riverrun Do that and the River Lords will join us
To do either we need to cross the river and the only crossing is at The Twins
Lord Frey controls that bridge Your fathers bannerman
The late Lord Frey my father calls him At the Trident he didnt appear until the battle was done Some men takes their oaths more seriously than others
Robbs right We need that bridge
So whats it gonna be Do we move against Jaime or Lord Tywin
Your pardon my lords Weve captured a Lannister scout
Dont worry lad He wont be leaving this tent with his head
Where did you find him
In the brush above the encampment He looked to be counting
How high did you get
20000 Maybe moreRodrik Cassel You dont have to do this yourself Your father would understand
My father understands mercy when there is room for it And he understands honor and courage Let him go
Robb
Tell Lord Tywin Winter is coming for him To find out if he really does shit gold
Yes My Lord Thank you My Lord
Are you touched boy Letting him go
You call me boy again
Go on
Oi
It is also the wish of His Grace that his loyal servant Janos Slynt Commander of the City Watch
Ser Aron
Be at once raised to the rank of Lord
Lord Gyles
And granted the ancient seat of Harrenhal and that his sons and grandsons shall hold this honor after him until the end of time In the place of the traitor Eddard Stark it is the wish of his Grace that Tywin Lannister Lord of Casterly Rock and Warden of the West be appointed Hand of the King Lastly in these times of treason and turmoil it is the view of the Council that the life and safety of King Joffrey be of paramount importance
Se
Your Grace I am yours to command
Rise Ser Barristan You may remove your helm You have served the Realm long and faithfully Every man and woman in the Seven Kingdoms owes you thanks But it is time to put aside your armor and your sword It is time to rest and look back with pride on your many years of service
Your Grace the Kingsguard is a sworn brotherhood Our vows are taken for life Only death relieves us of our sacred trust
Whose death Ser Barristan Yours or your Kings
You let my father die Youre too old to protect anybody
Your Grace
The Council has determined that Ser Jaime Lannister will take your place as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
The man who profaned his blade with the blood of the King he had sworn to defend
Careful Ser
We have nothing but gratitude for your long service good Ser You shall be given a stout Keep beside the sea with servants to look after your every need
A hall to die in and men to bury me I am a Knight I shall die a Knight
A naked Knight apparently
Even now I could cut through the five of you like carving a cake Here boy Melt it down and add it to the others
If any man in this hall has other matters to set before His Grace let him speak now or go forth and hold his silence
Your Grace
Come forward My Lady
The Lady Sansa of House Stark
Do you have some business for the King and the Council Sansa
I do
As it please Your Grace I ask mercy for my father Lord Eddard Stark who was Hand of the King
Treason is a noxious weed It should be torn out root
Let her speak I want to hear what she says
Thank you Your Grace
Do you deny your fathers crime
No My Lords I know he must be punished All I ask is mercy I know My Lord father must regret what he did He was King Roberts friend and he loved him You all know he loved him He never wanted to be Hand until the King asked him They must have lied to him Lord Renly or Lord Stannis or somebody They must have lied
He said I wasnt the King Why did he say that
He was badly hurt Maester Pycelle was giving him milk of the poppy He wasnt himself Otherwise h never would have said it
A childs faith Such sweet innocence And yet they say wisdom oft comes from the mouths of babes
Treason is treason
Anything else
If you still have any affection in your heart for me please do me this kindness Your Grace
Your sweet words have moved me But your father has to confess He has to confess and say that Im the King or therell be no mercy for him
Youve seen better days my lord
Another visit lt seems youre my last friend
No no many still love you Sansa came to court this morning to plead for your life
On her knees begging for me Hm Did you laugh with the others
You do me wrong my lord Your blood is the last thing l want
l dont know what you want lve given up trying to guess
When l was still a boy before they cut my balls off with a hot knife l traveled with a group of actors through the free cities They taught me that each man has a role to play The same is true at court l am the master of whisperers My role is to be sly obsequious and without scruples lm a good actor my lord
Huh Can you free me from this pit
l could But will l No As l said Im no hero
What do you want Tell me No riddles no stories Tell me what do you want
Peace Did you know that your son is marching south with an army of Northmen Loyal lad Fighting for his fathers freedom
Robb Hes just a boy
Boys have been conquerors before But the man giving Cersei sleepless nights is the kings the late kings brother Lord Stannis has the best claim to the throne He is a proven battle commander and he is utterly without mercy
Stannis Baratheon is Roberts true heir The throne is his by rights
Sansa pleaded so sweetly for your life lt would be a shame to throw it away Cersei is no fool She knows a tame wolf is more use to her than a dead one
You want me to serve the woman who murdered my king who butchered my men who crippled my son
l want you to serve the realm Tell the queen you will confess your vile treason tell your son to lay down his sword and proclaim Joffrey as the true heir Cersei knows you as a man of honor lf you give her the peace she needs and promise to carry her secret to your grave l believe she will allow you to take the black and live out your days on the Wall with your brother and your bastard son
You think my life is some precious thing to me That l would trade my honor for a few more years of of what You grew up with actors You learned their craft and you learnt it well But l grew up with soldiers l learned how to die a long time ago
Pity Such a pity What of your daughters life my lord ls that a precious thing to you e
lts a birthday message to his grandniece Walda
Or so Walder Frey would have you think
Keep shooting them down We cant risk Lord Walder sending word of your movements to the Lannisters
Hes Grandfathers bannerman We cant expect his support
Expect nothing of Walder Frey and youll never be surprised Look
Father rots in a dungeon How long before they take his head We need to cross the Trident and we need to do it now
Just march up to his gates and tell him youre crossing Weve got five times his numbers You can take the Twins if you have to
Not in time Tywin Lannister marches north as we speak
The Freys have held the crossing for 600 years and for 600 years they have never failed to exact their toll
Have my horse saddled and ready
Enter the Twins alone and hell sell you to the Lannisters as he likes
Or throw you in a dungeon Or slit your throat
My father would do whatever it took to secure our crossing Whatever it took lf lm going to lead this army l cant have other men doing my bargaining for me
l agree lll go
You cant
l have known Lord Walder since l was a girl He would never harm me
Unless there was a profit in it er
What do you want
lt is a great pleasure to see you again after so many years my lord
Oh spare me Your boys too proud to come before me himself What am l supposed to do with you
Father you forget yourself Lady Stark is
Who asked you Youre not Lord Frey yet not until l die Do l look dead to you
Father please
l need lessons in courtesy from you bastard Your mother would still be a milkmaid if l hadnt squirted you into her belly All right you come forward There Now that lve observed the courtesies perhaps my sons will do me the honor of shutting their mouths
ls there somewhere we can talk
Were talking right now Fine Out All of you Oh You too You see that Fifteen she is A little flower And her honeys all mine
lm sure she will give you many sons
Huh Your father didnt come to the wedding
He is quite ill my lord
Huh Didnt come to the last one either Or the one before that Your family has always pissed on me
My lord l
Dont deny it You know its true The fine Lord Tully would never marry any of his children to mine
lm sure there were reasons
l didnt need reasons l needed to get rid of sons and daughters You see how they pile up Why are you here
To ask you to open your gates my lord so my son and his bannermen may cross the Trident and be on their way
Why should l let him
lf you could climb your own battlements you would see that he has 20000 men outside your walls
There will be 20000 corpses when Tywin Lannister gets here Dont try and frighten me Lady Stark Your husbands in a cell beneath the Red Keep and your sons got no fur to keep his balls warm
You swore an oath to my father
Oh yes l said some words And l swore oaths to the crown too if l remember right Joffreys king now which makes your boy and his corpsestobe nothing but rebels it seems to me lf l had the sense the gods gave a fish ld hand you both over to the Lannisters
Why dont you
Stark Tully Lannister Baratheon Give me one good reason why l should waste a single thought on any of you 
And engage
When does Aemon think youll be able to use that hand
Soon he says
Good Youll be ready for this then l thought a wolf was more appropriate for you than a bear so l had a new pommel made lts called Longclaw Works as well for a wolf as a bear l think
This is Valyrian steel
lt was my fathers sword his father before him The Mormonts have carried it for five centuries lt was meant for my son Jorah He brought dishonor to our House but he had the grace to leave the sword before he fled from Westeros
My lord you honor me but l cant
Oh you can And you will l wouldnt be standing here if it wasnt for you and your beast A bloody dead man tried to kill me so youll take it lll hear no more about it ls that understood
Yes my lord
Right Now dont think this means l approve of this nonsense with you and Alliser Thorne Thats a mans sword ltll take a man to wield it
lll apologize to Ser Alliser tonight
No you wont l sent him to Kings Landing yesterday The hand that your wolf tore off that things wrist  lve ordered Thorne to lay it at the feet of this boy king That should get young Joffreys attention And it uh puts a thousand leagues between you and Thorne Now go and put your sword somewhere safe and bring me my supper
Yes my lord Unidentified Night
Well done Well doneNight
You earned that SnowNight
Well done
Go on lets have a look
At what
The sword Show us the sword
Sword Sword Sword Sword Sword Sword Sword Sword Sword
Lets have a look
Piss off
Come on l want to have a look at it in the light Give it here
Look at its eyes
What is it
l l cant
You cant what
lm really not supposed to say
And yet you really want to say You want to say that
There was a raven l read the message to Maester Aemon lts your brother Robb
What What about him
Hes heading south To war All his bannermen have rallied to his side theyll keep him safe
l should be there l should be with him 
lf we do that theyll never get back across
Well What did he say
Lord Walder has granted your crossing His men are yours as well
Huh
Less the 400 he will keep here to hold the crossing against any who would pursue you
What does he want in return
You will be taking on his son Olyvar as your personal squire He expects a knighthood in good time
Fine fine And
And Arya will marry his son Waldron when they both come of age
She wont be happy about that And
And when the fighting is done you will marry one of his daughters Whichever you prefer He has a number he thinks will be suitable
l see Did you get a look at his daughters
l did
And
One was  Do you consent
Can l refuse
Not if you want to cross
Then l consent 
Sam said you wanted to see me
l did indeed Perhaps you would be kind enough to assist me Tell me did you ever wonder why the men of the Nights Watch take no wives and father no children
No
So they will not love Love is the death of duty lf the day should ever come when your lord father was forced to choose between honor on the one hand and those he loves on the other what would he do
He would do whatever was right no matter what
Then Lord Stark is one man in 10000 Most of us are not so strong What is honor compared to a womans love And what is duty against the feel of a newborn son in your arms Or a brothers smile
Sam told you
Were all human Oh we all do our duty when theres no cost to it Honor comes easy then Yet sooner or later in every mans life there comes a day when it is not easy A day when he must choose
And this is my day ls that what youre saying
Oh it hurts boy Oh yes l know
You do not know No one knows l may be a bastard but he is my father and Robb is my brother
The gods were cruel when they saw fit to test my vows They waited till l was old What could l do when the ravens brought the news from the South the ruin of my House the death of my family l was helpless blind frail But when l heard they had killed my brothers son and his poor son and the children Even the little children
Who are you
My father was Maekar the first of his name My brother Aegon reigned after him when l had refused the throne And he was followed by his son Aerys whom they called the Mad King
Youre Aemon Targaryen
lm a maester of the Citadel bound in service to Castle Black and the Nights Watch l will not tell you to stay or go You must make that choice yourself and live with it for the rest of your days As l have 
My lord My sun and stars Drogo
My horse
Blood of my blood
No l must ride
He fell from his horse A Khal who cannot ride is no Khal
Hes tired thats all He needs to rest Weve ridden far enough today Well camp here
This is no place to camp A woman does not give us orders Not even a Khaleesi
Well camp here Tell them Khal Drogo commanded it
You do not command me Khaleesi
Find Mirri Maz Duur Bring her to me
The witch lll bring you her head Khaleesi
Bring her to me unharmed or Khal Drogo will hear why you denied me
Hyah Hyah
Our scouts tell us the Stark host has moved south from the Twins with Lord Freys levies in tow Theyre a days march north
The boy may lack experience and sense but he does have a certain mindless provincial courage
Oh do continue Didnt mean to interrupt
l do hope your savages are going to be of some use otherwise weve wasted good steel on them
The great hairy one insisted he must have two battleaxes Heavy black steel doublesided
Shagga likes axes
When the battle commences you and your wildlings will be in the vanguard
The vanguard Me and the tribesmen on the front lines
They do seem rather ferocious
Ferocious Last night a Moon Brother stabbed a Stone Crow over a sausage Three Stone Crows seized the Moon Brother and opened his throat Bronn managed to keep Shagga from chopping off the dead mans cock which was fortunate but even still Ulf is demanding blood money which Shagga and Gunthor refuse to pay
When soldiers lack discipline the fault lies with their commander
Surely there are ways to have me killed that would be less detrimental to the war effort
Therell be no more discussion on the matter
lt appears lm not hungry after all Excuse me my lordsBack at his tent Tyrion finds Bronn there with a woman waiting there too
Where did you find one so pretty at this hour
l took her
Took her From whom
From uh Ser Whatshisname l dont know Ginger cunt three tents down
And he didnt have anything to say about it
He said something
Well the odds of me living long enough for him to retaliate have just dropped drastically Well be at the vanguard tomorrow
Oh well l uh think lll go and find myself one
Who are you
Who would you like me to be
What did your mother call you
Shae What did your mother call you
My mother died giving birth to me
ls that why lm here So we can talk about our mothers
What sort of accent is that
Foreign
For
What do you want from me
What do l want from you l want you to share my tent l want you to pour my wine laugh at my jokes rub my legs when theyre sore after a days ride l want you to take no other man to bed for as long as were together And l want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world Which it may well be
And what do l get
One safety No one will hurt you for as long as youre mine Two the pleasure of my company which l have heard is spectacular
Who told you this Women you paid
And three more gold than you can spend if you lived a thousand years Do you accept my proposal
Lets start with your last night in this world Back across the Narrow Sea Drogo is mumbling incoherently in Dothraki inside a tent Daenerys by his side
Khaleesi
Come Hes very strong No one understands how strong he is
He will die tonight Khaleesi
He cant He cant l wont let him
Even a queen doesnt have that power We must go quickly lve heard theres a good port in Asshai
l wont leave him
Hes already gone Khaleesi
Even if he dies why would l run l am khaleesi and my my son will be khal after Drogo
This isnt Westeros where men honor blood Here they only honor strength There will be fighting after Drogo dies Whoever wins that fight will be the new khal He wont want any rivals Your boy will be plucked from your breast and given to the dogs
l wont leave him
The wound has festered
You did this witch
Stop it l dont want her hurt
No No You dont want her hurt Pray we dont hurt you too You let this witch put her hands on our Khal
Rein in your tongue She is still your Khaleesi
Only while the blood of my blood lives When he dies she is nothing
l have never been nothing l am the blood of the dragon
The dragons are all dead Khaleesi
l think you should wear your armor tonight ser
l think youre right
Youve saved me once more
And now you must save him
Hes beyond the healers skills All l can do is ease his path
Save him and l will free you l swear it You must know a way Some  some magic
There is a spell Some would say death is cleaner
Do it Save him
There is a price
Youll have gold whatever you want
lts not a matter of gold This is blood magic Only death pays for life
My death
No not your death Khaleesi Bring me his horse
Khaleesi do not do this thing Let me kill this witch
Kill her and you kill your khal
This is blood magic lt is forbidden
l am your khaleesi l tell you what is forbidden
Go Now
Take her and leave Take her
You must go also lady Once l begin to sing no one must enter the tent The dead will dance here tonight
No one will enter
Bring him back to me What have you done
l have to save himWe could have been 10 miles away from here by now on the way to Asshai You would have been safe
This must not be
This must be
Witch
Nothing good will come of this
No you cant
Khaleesi
No further horselord
Are you hurt
The baby
Hmm
is coming
Fetch the midwives
They will not come They say she is cursed
Theyll come or lll have their heads
The witch she can bring baby l hear her say so
Are you in agony my lion
No
You look like youre in agony The fire is burning your pretty soft skin
Ah Damn you woman Are you immune to pain
Just used to it
Drink
Lets play a new game
Theres a Braavosi knife game l could teach you
Does it involve the potential for losing fingers
Not if you win
No No fire games no knife games Lets do something lm good at
What are you good at
l happen to be a great judge of character
This sounds like a boring game
lts not Heres how it works l make a statement about your past lf lm right you drink lf lm wrong l drink And no lying lll know if youre lying
l dont want to play this game
Fine first Your father beat you
But my mother hit harder
You killed your first man before you were 12
lt was a woman She swung an axe at me
Youve been north of the Wall
What brought you up there
Work
And you once loved a woman many years ago but it turned out badly so youve never let yourself love again Oh wait thats me Your turn my mysterious foreign beauty
l dont want to play
lts fun Look at the fun were having Your mother was a whore
Drink
All right Your father left the family when you were very young never to return
Drink
And weve established the rules about lying
Drink
You wanted a different life You came from somewhere and you wanted to be elsewhere
The whole shitstained world could drink off that one
So specifics You wanted to be elsewhere but how would you get there l dont believe the life of the Silent Sisters is for you So whats a lowborn girl to do
Drink
Are you sure
Drink And dont talk about my mother and father ever or l will carve your eyes from your head
My dear lady if l have offended you l apologize
My turn
Fine fine Ask away Try to penetrate the enigma that is me
Who were you in love with
Thats not how the game works
l dont care the way the game works
Our lord here used to be married
Married
How did you hear that
You hear lots of things playing dice with Lannister soldiers
Another night perhaps
Not another night This night
lts not a pleasant story
Oh maybe l will cry
lm guessing the lady and l can tell more unpleasant stories than your lordship
So l was 16 My brother Jaime and l were riding when we heard a scream She ran out onto the road clothes half torn off with two men on her heels Jaime scared away the men easily enough while l wrapped her in my cloak She was too scared to send off on her own so while Jaime hunted down the rapers l took her to the nearest inn and fed her Her name was Tysha She was a wheelwrights orphan And she was hungry Together we finished off three chickens and a flagon of wine lmpossible as it seems there was a time when l was unaccustomed to wine l forgot how afraid l was around girls how l was always waiting for them to laugh at me or look away embarrassed or ask me about my tall handsome brother l forgot about everything but Tysha And somehow l found myself in her bed
For three chickens l should hope so
lt didnt last long l didnt know what the hell l was doing But she was good to me She kissed me afterwards and sang me a song And by morning l was deep enough in love to ask for her hand A few lies a few gold coins one drunken septon and there you have it man and wife For a fortnight anyway until the septon sobered up and told my father
Well l imagine that was the end of all that
Not quite First my father had Jaime tell me the truth The girl was a whore you see Jaime had arranged the whole thing the road the rapers all of it He thought it was time l had a woman After my brother confessed my father brought in my wife and gave her to his guards He paid her well a silver for each man How many whores command that kind of price He brought me into the barracks and made me watch By the end she had so much silver that the coins were slipping through her fingers and rolling on to the floor
l would have killed the man who did that to me
You should have known she was a whore
Really l was 16 drunk and in love
A girl who was almost raped doesnt invite another man into her bed two hours later
As l said l was young and stupid
You are still young and stupid
What is it What do you want
Youre sleeping through the war
What
They stole a nights march on us Theyre a mile north
Get my squire
You dont have a squire
lf l die weep for me
Youll be dead How will you know
lll know
Watch out Move
Out of the way Move aside
Stay low
Stay low
lf youre lucky no one will notice you
l was born lucky Tribesmen of the Vale gather round Stone Crows Black Ears Burned Men Moon Brothers And Painted Dogs Your dominion over the Vale begins now Onward to claim what is yours Tribesmen of the Vale Half man Half man Half man Half man Half man Half man
To battle
Youre a shit warrior

Did we win
We wouldnt be having this conversation if we didnt
How did our tribesmen do
Yeah good
lts nice to see them getting along
Youre wounded
Good of you to notice l hear we won
Huh The scouts were wrong There were 2000 Stark bannermen not 20
Did we get the Stark boy at least
He wasnt here
Where was he
With his other 18000 men
And where are they 
We should go my lady
No
My lady
Hyah Hyah
By the time they knew what was happening it had already happened
Lady Stark ld offer you my sword but l seem to have lost it
lt is not your sword l want Give me my daughters back Give me my husband
lve lost them too lm afraid
Kill him Robb Send his head to his father He cut down ten of our men You saw him
Hes more use to us alive than dead
Take him away and put him in irons
We could end this war right now boy save thousands of lives You fight for the Starks l fight for the Lannisters Swords or lances teeth nails choose your weapons and lets end this here and now
lf we do it your way Kingslayer youd win Were not doing it your way
Come on pretty man
l sent 2000 men to their graves today
The bards will sing songs of their sacrifice
Aye But the dead wont hear them One victory does not make us conquerors Did we free my father Did we rescue my sisters from the queen Did we free the North from those who want us on our knees This war is far from over
Could l have one A lemon one or any of themKing

I am Eddard Stark Lord of Winterfell and Hand of the King I come before you to confess my treason in the sight of Gods and men I betrayed the faith of my King and the trust of my friend Robert I swore to protect and defend his children but before his blood was cold I plotted to murder his son and seize the Throne for myself Let the High Septon and Baelor the Blessed bear witness to what I say Joffrey Baratheon is the one true heir to the Iron Throne by the grace of all the Gods Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
As we sin so do we suffer This man has confessed his crimes in sight of Gods and men The Gods are just but beloved Baelor taught us they can also be merciful What is to be done with this traitor Your Grace
My mother wishes me to let Lord Eddard join The Nights Watch Stripped of all titles and powers he would serve the realm in permanent exile And My Lady Sansa has begged mercy for her father But they have the soft hearts of women So long as I am your King treason shall never go unpunished Ser Ilyn bring me his head

Ser Meryn strikes Sansa repeatedly with the back of his hand leaving her lip bloodied Sansa notices the stone bridge Joffrey is on leads to a street some feet below She moves forward to lunge him from the edge but shes stopped by the Hound
Here girl
Will you obey now Or do you need another lesson lll look for you in court
Save yourself some pain girl Give him what he wants
Youll be needing that again 
The proper course is clear pledge fealty to King Renly and move south to join our forces with his
Renly is not the king
You cannot mean to hold to Joffrey my lord He put your father to death
That doesnt make Renly king Hes Roberts youngest brother lf Bran cant be Lord of Winterfell before me Renly cant be king before Stannis
Do you mean to declare us for Stannis
Renly is not right lf we put ourselves behind Stannis
My Lords My Lords Here is what l say to these two kings Renly Baratheon is nothing to me nor Stannis neither Why should they rule over me and mine from some flowery seat in the South What do they know of the Wall or the Wolfswood Even their gods are wrong Why shouldnt we rule ourselves again lt was the dragons we bowed to and now the dragons are dead There sits the only king l mean to bend my knee to the King in the North
lll have peace on those terms They can keep their Red Castle and their iron chair too ing in the North
Am l your brother now and always
Now and always
My sword is yours in victory and defeat from this day until my last day
ing in the North
ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North
ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North
Lady Stark
l want to see him Now Leave usThey walk for a while until they reach a single prisoner  kept away far from the rest
Leave us
You look lovely tonight Lady Stark Widowhood becomes you Your bed must be lonely ls that why you came lm not at my best but l think l could be of service You slip out of that gown and well see if lm up to it Oh l do like a violent woman
l will kill you tonight Ser Pack your head in a box and send it to your sister
Let me show you how Hit me again over the ear And again and again Youre stronger than you look it shouldnt take long
That is what you want the world to believe isnt it That you dont fear death
But l dont my lady The dark is coming for all of us Why cry about it
Because you are going to the deepest of the seven hells if the gods are just
What gods are those The trees your husband prayed to Where were the trees when his head was getting chopped off lf your gods are real and if they are just why is the world so full of injustice
Because of men like you
There are no men like me Only me
My son Bran How did he come to fall from that tower
l pushed him out the window
Why
I hoped the fall would kill him
Why
You should get some sleep lts going to be a long war
l cant believe were actually at war Was it this exciting last time when you were young What does it say Have we captured Robb Stark yet Whats our next move
Stop talking Get back into bed
They have my son
The Stark boy appears to be less green than wed hoped
lve heard his wolf killed a dozen men and as many horses
ls it true about Stannis and Renly
Both Baratheon brothers have taken up against us Jaime captured his armies scattered lts a catastrophe Perhaps we should sue for peace
Theres your peace Joffrey saw to that when he decided to remove Ned Starks head Youll have an easier time drinking from that cup than you will bringing Robb Stark to the table now Hes winning  in case you hadnt noticed
lm told we still have his sisters
The first order of business is ransoming Ser Jaime
First we must return to Casterly Rock to raise
They have my son Get out all of you Not you You were right about Eddard Stark lf he were alive we could have used him to broker a peace with Winterfell and Riverrun which would have given us more time to deal with Roberts brothers But now  madness Madness and stupidity l always thought you were a stunted fool Perhaps l was wrong
Half wrong lm new to strategy but unless we want to be surrounded by three armies it appears we cant stay here
No one will stay here Ser Gregor will head out with 500 riders and set the Riverland on fire from Gods Eye to the Red Fork The rest of us will regroup at Harrenhal And you will go to Kings Landing
And do what
Rule You will serve as Hand of the King in my stead You will bring that boy king to heel and his mother too if needs be And if you get so much as a whiff of treason from any of the rest  Baelish Varys Pycelle
Heads spikes walls Why not my uncle Why not anyone Why me
Youre my son Oh one more thing You will not take that whore to court Do you understand
Ser Jorah
Gently gently
My son  where is he l want him Where is he
The boy did not live
Tell me
What is there to tell
How did my son die
He never lived my princess The women say
What do the women say
They say the child was
Monstrous twisted l pulled him out myself He was scaled like a lizard blind with leather wings like the wings of a bat When l touched him the skin fell from his bones Inside he was full of graveworms l warned you that only death can pay for life You knew the price
Where is Khal Drogo Show him to me Show me what l bought with my sons life
As you command lady Come l will take you to him
Time enough for that later
l want to see him now
The khalasar is gone
A khal who cannot ride is no khal The Dothraki follow only the strong lm sorry my Princess
Drogo My sun and stars Why is he out here alone
He seems to like the warmth Princess
He lives You asked for life you paid for life
This is not life When will he be as he was
When the sun rises in the west sets in the east When the seas go dry When the mountains blow in the wind like leaves
Leave us
l dont want you alone with this sorceress
l have nothing more to fear from this woman Go
You knew what l was buying and you knew the price
lt was wrong of them to burn my temple lt angered the Great Shepherd
This is not Gods work My child was innocent
lnnocent He would have been The Stallion Who Mounts The World Now he will burn no cities Now his khalasar will trample no nations into dust
l spoke for you l saved you
Saved me Three of those riders had already raped me before you saved me girl l saw my gods house burn there where l had healed men and women beyond counting ln the streets l saw piles of heads the head of the baker who makes my bread the head of a young boy that l had cured of fever just three moons past So tell me again exactly what it was that you saved
Your life
Why dont you take a look at your khal Then you will see exactly what life is worth when all the rest has gone 
You cant
Get out of my way Sam
Theyll put out the word Theyll send out ravens People will come after you Do you know what happens to deserters
Better than you do
What are you going to do
lm gonna find my brother and put a sword through King Joffreys throat
You cant leave us now We need you here
Move
l wont let you go
Move
No
Hyah
Hand of the King
So it would seem
And your father said you couldnt take anyone with you to Kings Landing
No he said l couldnt take you with me to Kings Landing He was very specific on that point
He knew my name
What
He said Dont bring Shae with you to Kings Landing 
l believe he used the word whore
Are you ashamed of me Are you afraid that lm dancing around the court with my tits out
Im funny now lm Shae the funny whore
My fathers probably the most powerful man in the country Certainly the richest He has all Seven Kingdoms in his pockets Everyone everywhere always has to do exactly what my father says Hes always been a cunt l believe the ladies of the court could learn a great deal from a girl like you Why dont you come with me be the Hands lady Because the King needs a Hand and the Hand

Hyah Hyah Hyah Hyah
Samwell
ls he dead
No hes not dead
Did we get him
Come on help me get him up
Lucky youve got plenty of padding Were taking you back to where you belong
l belong with my brother
But were your brothers now
Theyll kill you if they find out youve gone
Theyll kill you if they know you came after me Go back
Sam told us everything Were sorry about your father
But it doesnt matter You took the oath You cant leave
l have to
You cant You said the words
I dont care about
Hear my words and bear witness to my vow
To hell with all of you
Night gathers and now my watch begins lt shall not end until my death l shall live and die at my post
l am the sword in the darkness  Sam Pyp
l am the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the realms of men l pledge my life and honor to the Nights Watch for this night and all nights to come 
Do you remember our first ride my sun and stars lf you are in there if you havent gone away show me Youre a fighter Youve always been a fighter l need you to fight now l know youre very far away but come back to me my sun and stars
When the sun rises in the west and sets in the east Then you shall return to me my sun and stars In Kings Landing Pycelle is having a conversation with someone in his bedchambers
Kings Oh l can tell you all there is to know about kings The thing you need to understand about kings is  For the past 67 years lve known truly known more kings than any man alive Theyre complicated men but l know how to serve them Yes and keep on serving them Aerys Targaryen Of all the thousand thousand maladies the Gods visit on us madness is the worst He was a good man Such a charmer To watch him melt away before my eyes consumed by dreams of fire and blood Robert Baratheon was an entirely different animal  powerful man great warrior but alas winning a kingdom and ruling a kingdom are rather different things They say that if a man goes through life with his battle visor down he can often be blind to the enemies at his side Now l serve his son King Joffrey may the Gods bless his reign
He is a capable young man Strong military mind Stern But sternness in defense of the realm is no vice lts far too soon to know what manner of king he will be but l sense true greatness on the horizon for our new King Mmm True greatness
So whats the thing
What thing
About kings You said The thing you need to understand about kings
What Things What
When you started you Never mind
Let me see you out my dear
lts all right No need
Yes yes Till the next time Right
When you imagine yourself up there how do you look Does the crown fit Do all the lords and ladies simper and bow the ones who sneered at you for years
lts hard for them to simper and bow without heads
A man with great ambition and no morals l wouldnt bet against you
And what would you do my friend if you found yourself sitting up there
l must be one of the few men in this city who doesnt want to be King
You must be one of the few men in the city who isnt a man
Oh you can do better than that
When they castrated you did they take the pillar with the stones lve always wondered
Have you Do you spend a lot of time wondering whats between my legs
l picture a gash Like a womans ls that about right
l am flattered of course to be pictured at all
Must be strange for you even after all these years a man from another land despised by most feared by all
Am l That is good to know Do you lie awake at night fearing my gash
But you carry on whispering in one kings ear and then the next l admire you
And l admire you Lord Baelish A grasper from a minor House with a major talent for befriending powerful men  and women
A useful talent lm sure youd agree
So here we stand in mutual admiration and respect
Playing our roles
Serving a new King
Long may he reign My king
My king
My lords Shall we begin
Youre Arry now hear me Arry the orphan boy No one asks an orphan too many questions cause nobody gives three shits Whats your name
Arry
Youve a long way to travel and in bad company lve 20 this time  men and boys all bound for the Wall Your lord father gave me the pick of the dungeons and l didnt find no little lordlings down there This lot  half of them would turn you over to the King quick as spit for a pardon And the other half would do the same except theyd rape you first So keep to yourself  and when you piss do it in the woods alone You stay with this lot boy And stay or lll lock you in the back of the wagon with these three
Watch yourself midget
Hes got a sword this one
Whats a gutter rat like you doing with a sword
Maybe hes a little squire
He aint no squire Look at him He looks like a girl l bet he stole that sword
Lets have a look
l could use me a sword like that
Take it off him
Give it here midget
Look at him Youd better give the sword lve seen him kick a boy to death
l knocked him down and l kicked him in the balls and l kept kicking him until he was dead l kicked him all to pieces You better give me that sword
You want it lll give it to you l already killed one fat boy l bet you never killed anyone l bet youre a liar But lm not lm good at killing fat boys l like killing fat boys
Your like picking on the little ones do you lve been hammering an anvil these past 10 years When l hit that steel it sings Are you gonna sing when l hit you This is castleforged steel Whered you steal it
lt was a gift

Which are you
Armourers apprentice But my master got sick of me so here l am
Come on you sorry sons of whores lts a thousand leagues from here to the Wall and winter is coming
Ham How many days in a row must a man be expected to start his day with ham Bring me some beer at least You look exhausted Was your moonlight ride that tiring Dont look so terrified lf we beheaded everyone that ran away for the night only ghosts would guard the Wall At least you werent whoring in Moles Town Honor made you leave honor brought you back
My friends brought me back
l didnt say it was your honor
They killed my father
And youre gonna bring him back to life are you No Good Weve had enough of that sort of thing Beyond the Wall the Rangers are reporting whole villages abandoned At night they see fires blazing in the mountains from dusk until dawn A captured wildling swears their tribes are uniting in some secret stronghold to what ends the gods only know Outside Eastwatch Cotter Pykes men discovered four blueeyed corpses Unlike us they were wise enough to burn them Do you think your brothers war is more important than ours
No
When dead men and worse come hunting for us in the night do you think it matters who sits on the lron Throne
No
Good Because l want you and your wolf with us when we ride out beyond the Wall tomorrow
Beyond the Wall
lll not sit meekly by and wait for the snows l mean to find out whats happening The Nights Watch will ride in force against the wildlings the White Walkers and whatever else is out there And we will find Benjen Stark alive or dead l will command them myself So lll only ask you once Lord Snow are you a brother of the Nights Watch or a bastard boy who wants to play at war
ls this your command Khaleesi
Drogo will have no use for dragon eggs in the Night Lands Sell them You can return to the Free Cities and live as a wealthy woman for all your days
They were not given to me to sell
Khaleesi my Queen l vow to serve you obey you to die for you if need be but let him go Khaleesi l know what you intend Do not
l must You dont understand
Dont ask me to stand aside as you climb on that pyre l wont watch you burn
ls that what you fear You will be my khalasar l see the faces of slaves l free you Take off your collars Go if you wish no one will stop you But if you stay it will be as brothers and sisters as husbands and wives
Ser Jorah bind this woman to the pyre You swore to obey me l am Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen of the blood of old Valyria I am the Dragons daughter And I swear to you that those who would harm you will die screaming
You will not hear me scream
I will But it is not your screams I want Only your life
Well struck Well struck Dog
Did you like that
It was well struck Your Grace
I already said it was well struck
Yes Your Grace
Whos next
Lothor Brune freerider in the service of Lord Baelish
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard
Ser Dontos the Red of House Hollard
Here I am Here I am Sorry Your Grace My deepest apologies
Are you drunk
No Uh no Your Grace I had I had two cups of wine
Two cups Thats not much at all Please have another cup
Are you sure Your Grace
Yes to celebrate my name day Have two have as much as you like
I would be honored Your Grace
Ser Meryn help Ser Dontos celebrate my name day See that he drinks his fill
You cant
What did you say Did you say I cant
I only meant it would be bad luck to kill a man on your name day
What kind of stupid peasants superstition
The girl is right What a man sows on his name day he reaps all year
Take him away Ill have him killed tomorrow the fool
He is A fool youre so clever to see it Hell make a much better fool than a knight He doesnt deserve the mercy of a quick death
Did you hear My Lady Ser Dontos From this day  youll be my new fool
Thank you Your Grace And you My Lady thank you
Beloved nephew
We looked for you on the battlefield You were nowhere to be found
Ive been here ruling the kingdoms
What a fine job youve done Look at you More beautiful than ever And you You youre going to be bigger than the Hound but much better looking This one doesnt like me
Cant imagine why
We heard you were dead
Im glad youre not dead
Me too dear Death is so boring especially now with so much excitement in the world My Lady Im sorry for your loss
Her loss Her father was a confessed traitor
But still her father Surely having so recently lost your own beloved father you can sympathize
My father was a traitor My mother and brother are traitors too I am loyal to my beloved Joffrey
Of course you are
Well  enjoy your name day Your Grace Wish I could stay and celebrate but there is work to be done
What work Why are you here
The raven arrived from the Citadel this morning Your Grace The conclave has met  considered reports from Maesters all over the Seven Kingdoms and declared this great summer done at last The longest summer in living memory
The peasants say a long summer means an even longer winter
A common superstition
We have enough wheat for a fiveyear winter If it lasts any longer  well have fewer peasants
The citys drowning in refugees Your Grace fleeing the war We have nowhere to house them and with winter coming itll only get worse
You command the City Watch do you not Lord Slynt
I do Your Grace
And are you not a Lord at my command
I owe my title and lands to your generosity Your Grace
Then do your job Shut the gates to the peasants They belong in the field not our capital
Yes Your Grace
Dont get up More ravishing than ever big sister War agrees with you Forgive the interruption carry on
What are you doing here
Its been a remarkable journey I  pissed off the edge of the Wall I slept in a sky cell I fought with the hill tribes So many adventures so much to be thankful for
What are you doing here This is the small council
Yes well I do believe the Hand of the King is welcome at all small council meetings
Our father is Hand of the King
Yes but in his absence
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as Hand in his stead while he fights
Out All of you out I would like to know how you tricked father into this
If I were capable of tricking father Id be emperor of the world by now You brought this on yourself
Ive done nothing
Quite right You did nothing when your son called for Ned Starks head Now the entire North has risen up against us
I tried to stop it
Did you You failed That bit of theater will haunt our family for a generation
Robb Stark is a child
Whos won every battle hes fought Do you understand were losing the war
What do you know about warfare
Nothing But I know people And I know that our enemies hate each other almost as much as they hate us
Joffrey is King
Joffrey is King
You are here to advise him
Im only here to advise him And if the King listens to what I say the King might just get his Uncle Jaime back
How
You love your children Its your one redeeming quality That and your cheekbones The Starks love their children as well And we have two of them
One
One
Arya little animal she disappeared
Disappeared What in a puff of smoke We had three Starks to trade You chopped ones head off and let another escape Father will be furious It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child
My Lord may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
The walls of my Holdfast will not stand the winter The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys and Im afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers hammers When I was a boy I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhens Square in a summer Men worked back then Today my Holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children At night you can hear the wind howling through the gaps And the Gods forbid it rains Why I might as well sleep beneath a waterfall
Maintenance of a Holdfast generally falls to the lord of that Holdfast
Generally yes but Ive sent all the young men off to fight Robb Starks war
King Robb And its not his war He didnt choose it
Maybe not My Lord but he called in his Banners and took the men
Joffrey killed my father your liege lord Do you remember your vows Ser
Of course I remember
We can spare four masons for a week My Lord Will that be sufficient to repair your walls
I I believe it will
We didnt want him here all day did we
I didnt like the way he was talking about Robb
Nor did I But listening to people youd rather not listen to is one of your responsibilities as Lord of Winterfell Lord Portan
My Lord may the Old Gods watch over your brother and all our northern sons
Boil this for an hour and drink the tea Makes all your pain go away
Dont have any pain
Lucky for you
That way
Youve been having those dreams again
I dont dream
Everyone dreams
I dont Heard some of the men talking about the comet They say its an omen They say it means Robb will win a great victory in the South
Did they I heard some other fools say its Lannister Red Means the Lannisters will rule all Seven Kingdoms before long I heard a stable boy say its the color of blood to mark the death of your father
The stars dont fall for men The red comet means one thing boy Dragons
The dragons are all dead Theyve been dead for centuries
What did your brother say about them Khaleesi
He said they ate meat
He didnt tell you what kind of meat
My brother didnt know anything about dragons He didnt know anything about anything
She was Drogos first gift to me
I remember
I promised to protect them Promised them their enemies would die screaming How do I make starvation scream
A trick I never learned Im afraid
Does it ever end
This is further east than Ive ever been But yes Khaleesi everything ends even the red waste
And youre sure theres no other way
If we go south to the land of the Lazarheen the Lamb Men will kill us and take your dragons If we go west to the Dothraki Sea the first Khalasar we meet will kill us and take your dragons
No one will take my dragons
They are too weak to fight as are your people You must be their strength
As you are mine
Rakharo Aggo Kovarro Take our remaining horses You will ride east you southeast and you northeast
What do we seek Khaleesi
Cities living or dead Caravans and people Rivers or lakes or the great salt sea Find how far the Red Waste extends before us and what lies on the other side
Rokharo you are my last hope blood of my blood
I will not fail you blood of my blood
You never have
This is bad time to start
Having a rough time of it
Nothings killed me yet
Your ass killed the sledge
You offered me a ride
I just wanted you to shut up about your damn blisters
I was born in a place like this Later I fell on hard times The camera moves through the camp to show some of the women working
Are those girls
Crasters daughters
I havent seen a girl in six months
Id keep on not seeing them if I were you
What he dont like people messing with his daughters
He dont like people messing with his wives
He marries his daughters and they give him more daughters and on and on it goes
Thats foul
Its beyond foul
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared Crasters still here He must be doing something right
What happens to the boys
Hmm
He marries his daughters What does he do with his sons
He said he planned to stop here on his way to the Frostfangs
People make all sorts of plans I havent seen Benjen Stark in three years Havent missed him Always treated me like scum Havent had any good wine for a long time You Southerners make good wine Ill give you that
Were not Southerners
Whos this little girl Youre prettier than half my daughters You got a nice wet twat between your legs Whats your name
Jon Snow
Snow eh Listen to me bastard All you lot from south of the Wall youre Southerners But now youre in the North the real North
The lad meant no harm
I catch that pretty little bastard talking to my daughters
No one will talk to your daughters you have my word Now sit down and shut your mouth
You bring any of that good wine with you
We did We passed through six villages on the way here All six were abandoned Where have all the wildlings gone
I could tell you but Im thirsty
Theres a barrel of Dornish wine on the sledge Bring it in here
Yes commander
You want to know where theyve all gone North To join up with Mance Rayder Your old friend
Hes no friend of mine He broke his vows betrayed his brothers
Oh aye But once he was just a poor black crow And now hes KingBeyondtheWall
Hes been calling himself that for years Whats he king of A frozen lake somewhere
Thats a goodlooking axe Fresh forged
Give it here
Youll have another one made at Castle Black Here
Oh thats some lovely steel You want to know what Mance Rayder is doing Gathering an army What I hear hes already got more men than any of your southern kings
And where does he plan marching this army
When youre all the way north theres only one direction to go
These are bad times to be living alone in the wild The cold winds are rising
Let them come My roots are sunk deep Wife tell the Lord Crow how content we are
This is our place Our husband keeps us safe Better to live free than die a slave
Dont it make you jealous old man to see me with all these young wives and you with no one to warm your bed
We chose different paths
Oh aye and you chose the path with no one but boys on it Youll be wanting to sleep beneath my roof I suppose and eat me out of pigs
A roof would be welcome Its been hard riding Weve brought our own food and good steel for you
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives he loses the hand And I see this one  staring too long I might just gouge his eyes out
Your roof your rules
Who am I Who am I
Lord commander
And who are you
Jon Snow
Who are you
Your steward
You want to lead one day Then learn how to follow
Lord of Light come to us in our darkness We offer you these false Gods
Take them and cast your light upon us For the night is dark and full of terrors
For the night is dark and full of terrors
After the long summer darkness will fall heavy on the world Stars will bleed
We need to stop her
The cold breath of winter will freeze the seas
Not now
And the dead shall rise in the North
All you men were named in the Light of the Seven Is this how you treat the Gods of your fathers Are you so eager to spit on your ancestors
You smell of fear fear and piss and old bones Do you want to stop me Stop me
In the ancient books its written that a warrior will draw a burning sword from the fire And that sword shall be Lightbringer Stannis Baratheon warrior of light your sword awaits you
Lord cast your light upon us
For the night is dark and full of terrors
For the night is dark and full of terror
This woman will lead him into a war he cannot win
Stannis is our king We follow where he leads even if we dont like the path
King Since that boar killed his brother every lord wants a coronation
I dont serve the others I serve Stannis
As do I but loyal service means telling hard truths Hes surrounded by fools and fanatics but he trusts you Davos If you tell him the truth
Whats the truth
And I declare upon the honor of my house that my beloved brother Robert le
He wasnt my beloved brother I didnt love him he didnt love me
A harmless courtesy Your Grace
A lie Take it out
That my brother Robert left no trueborn heirs the boy Joffrey the boy Tommen and the girl Myrcella being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister By right of birth 
Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer Call him what he is
And her brother Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer By right of birth and blood I do this day lay claim 
Make it Ser Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer Whatever else he is the mans still a knight
Ser Jaime Lannister the Kingslayer By right of birth and blood I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros Let all true men declare their loyalty
When Eddard Stark learned the truth he told only me Ill not make the same mistake Send copies of that letter to every corner of the Realm from the Arbor to the Wall The time has come to choose Let no man claim ignorance as an excuse
Your Grace the Lannisters are the true enemy If for the time being you could make peace with your brother
Ill not make peace with Renly while he calls himself King
Well many have already declared for him Mace Tyrell Randyll Tarly
Stannis does not need to beg this lord or that lord for support The Lord of Light stands behind him
And how many ships has the Lord of Light got in his fleet
He has no need for ships
Im sure he doesnt but we do if were going to war If not Renly Your Grace join forces with Robb Stark
Who would steal the northern half of my kingdom Ive always served thieves according to their desserts as you well know Ser Davos Joffrey Renly Robb Stark theyre all thieves Theyll bend the knee or Ill destroy them
I owe you an apology my King My duty is to serve You have chosen the new God over the Old Gods May the Lord of Light watch over us all Shall we drink together
Dont
A cup of wine to honor the one true God
The night is dark and full of terrors old man but the fire burns them all away Your Grace
King in the North I keep expecting you to leave me in one castle or another for safekeeping but you drag me along from camp to camp Have you grown fond of me Stark Is that it Ive never seen you with a girl
If I left you with one of my bannermen your father would know within a fortnight and my bannerman would receive a raven with a message Release my son and youll be rich beyond your dreams Refuse and your house will be destroyed root and stem
You dont trust the loyalty of the men following you into battle
Oh I trust them with my life Just not with yours
Smart boy Whats wrong Dont like being called boy Insulted
You insult yourself Kingslayer Youve been defeated by a boy
Youre held captive by a boy Perhaps youll be killed by a boy Stannis Baratheon sent ravens to all the high lords of Westeros King Joffrey Baratheon is neither a true king nor a true Baratheon Hes your bastard son
If thats true Stannis is the rightful king How convenient for him
My father learned the truth Thats why you had him executed
I was your prisoner when Ned Stark lost his head
Your son killed him so the world wouldnt learn who fathered him And you you pushed my brother from a window because he saw you with the queen
You have proof Or do you want to trade gossip like a couple of fishwives
Im sending one of your cousins down to Kings Landing with my peace terms
You think my fathers going to negotiate with you You dont know him very well
No but hes starting to know me
Three victories dont make you a conqueror
Its better than three defeats
This city stinks Like dead bodies
A bit corpsey yes
And shit
I thought you wanted to come here
I love it
You love the smell of dead bodies and shit
And cum and garlic and rum
You can smell cum from the balcony
I love the stink I love the noise Cities make me want to fuck
And so did the country
This is where I belong
Yes well you need to be careful No one can know youre here
No one will know
You cant trust anyone in Kings Landing Theyre all liars good liars bad liars one or two great liars
What about you
Me Im not from here Im a slave to the truth
Truth You are the biggest little liar I have ever met
Why do you think I am so little Im being  crushed beneath the weight of all that truth
Ned Stark actually slept on this as if the poor man didnt suffer enough One of the many changes well have to make around here
Lord Baelish
Your Grace
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
Of course Your Grace
Ned Starks youngest daughter Arya we cant seem to locate her
If shes escaped the capital Winterfell seems the logical destination
And yet my friends in the North report no sign of her
Curious
If we choose to negotiate with the Starks the girl has some value Whoever finds her well you know what they say about Lannisters and debts
Well you could ask Varys where she is Hell have an answer for you Whether you believe it Myself I have always had a hard time trusting eunuchs Who knows what they want
A mockingbird You created your own Sigil didnt you
Yes
Appropriate for a selfmade man with so many songs to sing
Im glad you like it Some people are fortunate enough to be born into the right family Others have to find their own way
I heard a song once about a boy of modest means who found his way into the home of a very prominent family He loved the eldest daughter Sadly she had eyes for another
When boys and girls live in the same home awkward situations can arise Sometimes Ive heard even brothers and sisters develop certain affections And when these affections become common knowledge well that is an awkward situation indeed Especially in a prominent family But prominent families often forget a simple truth Ive found
And which truth is that
Knowledge is power
Seize him Cut his throat Stop Wait Ive changed my mind Let him go Step back three paces Turn around Close your eyes Power is power Do see if you can take some time away from your coins and your whores to locate the Stark girl for me I would very much appreciate it
Youre Ser Alton Lannister
I am Your Grace
I offer your cousins peace if they meet my terms First your family must release my sisters Second my fathers bones must be returned to us so he may rest beside his brother and sister in the crypts beneath Winterfell And the remains of all those who died in his service must also be returned Their families can honor them with proper funerals
An honorable request Your Grace
Third Joffrey and the Queen Regent must renounce all claim to dominion of the North From this time till the end of time we are a free and independent kingdom
ing in the North THE OTHERS AT THE
King in the North
Neither Joffrey nor any of his men shall set foot in our lands again If he disregards this command he shall suffer the same fate as my father only I dont need a servant to do my beheading for me
These are Your Grace these are
These are my terms If the Queen Regent and her son meet them Ill give them peace If not I will litter the south with Lannister dead
King Joffrey is a Baratheon Your Grace
Oh is he Youll ride at daybreak Ser Alton That will be all for tonight
A word Your Grace
You dont have to call me Your Grace when no ones around
Its not so bad once you get used to it
Im glad someones gotten used to it
The Lannisters are going to reject your terms you know
Of course they are
We can fight them in the fields as long as you like but we wont beat them until you take Kings Landing And we cant take Kings Landing without ships My father has ships and men who know how to sail them
Men who fought my father
Men who fought King Robert to free themselves from the yoke of the South just like youre doing now Im his only living son Hell listen to me I know he will Im not a Stark I know that But your father raised me to be an honorable man We can avenge him together
You dont want Balon Greyjoy for an ally
I need his ships They say he has 200
They say a million rats live in the sewers of Kings Landing Shall we rally them to fight for us
I understand you dont trust Lord Greyjoy
I dont trust Lord Greyjoy because he is not trustworthy Your father had to go to war to end his rebellion
Yes And now Im the one rebelling against the throne Before me it was father You married one rebel and mothered another
I mothered more than just rebels a fact you seem to have forgotten
If I trade the Kingslayer for two girls my bannermen will string me up by my feet
You want to leave Sansa in the Queens hands And Arya I havent heard a word about Arya What are we fighting for if not for them
Its more complicated than that You know it is
Its time for me to go home I havent seen Bran or Rickon in months
You cant go to Winterfell
I beg your pardon
Ill send Rodrik to watch over the boys cause tomorrow youll ride south to the Stormlands
Why in the name of all the Gods
Because I need you to negotiate with Renly Baratheon Hes rallied an army of 100000 You know him You know his family
I havent seen Renly Baratheon since he was a boy You have a hundred other lords
Which of these lords do I trust more than you If Renly sides with us well outnumber them two to one When they feel the jaws beginning to shut theyll sue for peace Well get the girls back Then well all go home for good
I will ride at first light
We will all be together again soon I promise
Youve done so well Your father would be proud
Give Lord Renly my regards
King Renly Theres a king in every corner now
What is all this
Returning this room to its proper appearance Say what you will about the Targaryens they were conquerors That is a seat for a conqueror It needs a room to match it not vines and flowers
We cant find Arya Stark
With luck shes dead in a ditch somewhere
Perhaps But if not we need her Theyll never give Jaime back to us for Sansa alone
I think they might Theyre weak They put too much value on their women
We need to set our armies to the task of finding her Send out as many men as we can Im sure if you asked grandfather
ing does not ask He commands And my grandfathers stupidity in the field of battle is the reason Robb Stark has Uncle Jaime in the first place
His life is in danger
Were at war All our lives are in danger I heard a disgusting lie about Uncle Jaime And you
Our enemies will say anything to weaken your claim to the throne
Its not a claim The throne is mine
Of course it is No one believes this foul gossip
Someone believes it Father had other children Besides me and Tommen and Myrcella
What are you asking
Im asking if he fucked other women when he grew tired of you How many bastards does he have running
What you just did is punishable by death You will never do it again Never That will be all Mother
No no no no Do you have any idea how ridiculous you sound Ease into it Slowly with passion
Go wash yourselves Put some clothes on Both of you are working tonight
We do things differently here Daisy This isnt some fivecopper bawdy house in Hayseed Hall
Haystack Hall
Wherever youre from Our establishment doesnt cater to ploughmen and goat herders Lord Olsen Taste is everything here
Littlefingers a fancy man
Dont call him Littlefinger he doesnt like it Lord Baelish
She pretends she doesnt speak the common tongue so that people will think shes exotic She grew up just down the road in flea bottom
Shes beautiful
Shes a dumb slut really but a lid for every pot Lord Commander Good to see you again
You do realize this establishment is owned by Lord Petyr Baelish the Kings Master of Coin Coin which goes in many pockets
Orders
Whose orders
Someone who doesnt care what Littlefinger thinks
No you cant
No Please No Not my Barra Please Please
Enough Get it done Kill the bastard
Give it here

Gendry His name is Gendry
Where is the bastard
The Nights Watch Please stop
Where
They took him up the Kingsroad heading north
How will we know him
Hes got a bulls head helmet He made it himself
What are you doing here
Your father has named Lord Tyrion to serve as hand in his stead
You brought this on yourself
Ive done nothing
Do you understand were losing the war
Does it ever end
Everything ends even the red waste
Rakharo Aggo Kovarro Take our remaining horses Find out how far the Red Waste extends before us and what lies on the other side
All the other wildlings for a hundred leagues have disappeared Crasters still here
Any man lays a hand on one of my wives he loses the hand
He marries his daughters and they give him more daughters
What happens to the boys What does he do with his sons
My brother Robert left no trueborn heirs the boy Joffrey being born of incest between Cersei Lannister and her brother Jaime Lannister By right of birth and blood I do this day lay claim to the Iron Throne of Westeros
Send copies of that letter to every corner of the realm
Im sending one of your cousins down to Kings Landing with my peace terms
You think my fathers going to negotiate with you You dont know him very well
We wont beat them until we take Kings Landing and we cant take Kings Landing without ships My father has ships and men who know how to sail them
Men who fought my father
Im his only living son Hell listen to me
You dont want Balon Greyjoy for an ally
I need his ships
He is not trustworthy
I heard a disgusting lie about uncle Jaime and you Father had other children
What are you asking
How many bastards does he have running around
Where is the bastard
The Nights Watch Heading North
Boy
Lovely boy

A man has a thirst The man does not drink for a day and a night A boy could make a friend
I have friends
Give us a beer Before I skin you
A man does not choose his companions These two they have no courtesy A man must ask forgiveness Youre called Arry This man has the honor to be Jaqen Hghar Once of the Free City of Lorath
Hey you little shit Get us beer
You should have asked nicely
Come closer And Ill shove that stick up your bunghole and fuck you bloody
The boy has more courage than sense
Come here
Yoren said none of us were should go near of those three
Come here
They dont scare me
Hmm Then youre stupid They scare me
What are gold cloaks doing this far from Kings Landing
What are you doing
Theyre looking for me
Youre in command here
Youre a long way from home
I asked you a question
Aye you did You asked without manners And I chose not to answer
I have a royal warrant For one of these gutter rats youre transporting
Well the thing is  these gutter rats belong to the Nights Watch now That puts them beyond the reach of kings and queens
Its a funny thing People worry so much about their throats they forget about whats down low Now I sharpened this blade before breakfast I could shave a spiders arse if I wanted to Or I could nick this artery in your leg and once its nicked theres no one around here who knows how to unnick it
Well just keep that Good steel is always needed on the wall Seems you have a choice You can die here at this crossroads a long way from home Or you can go back to your city and tell your masters you didnt find what you were looking for
Were looking for a boy named Gendry He carries a bulls head helmet Anyone turning him over will earn the Kings reward Well be back With more men And Ill be taking your head home along with that bastard boy
My lord
You make me wait a long time but your friend keeps me company
We were just speaking of your bravery in the victory against the Stark auxiliary forces
It was quite a battle
I heard you suffered a terrible head wound The northerners are such fearsome warriors
And I tell him the story of how we meet
To find so lovely creature working in your fathers kitchen It almost beggars belief
Strange things do happen You should taste her fish pie
I dont think Lord Varys likes fish pie
How can you tell
I can always tell
Men like Lord Varys and I cant let our disadvantages get the best of us Well make a fisherman of him yet
I am glad your new friend was able to accompany you to the capital Friends are such an important part of life Unfortunate that your father didnt want her to come But rest easy my lord I am very good at keeping secrets for my good friends
Your discretion is legendary where your friends are concerned
How unspeakable of me to go on and on when all you want to do is rest I will leave you Welcome to Kings Landing my dear The city is made brighter by your presence We have a council meeting my lord
I dont like threats
Who threatened you
Im not Ned Stark I understand the way this game is played
Ned Stark was a man of honor
And I am not Threaten me again and I will have you thrown into the sea
You might be disappointed in the results The storms come and go The big fish eat the little fish And I keep on paddling Come my lord We shouldnt keep the queen waiting
From this time until the end of time we are not part of your realm but a free and independent Kingdom of the North He has more spirit than his father Ill give him that
Youve perfected the art of tearing up papers Give him his fathers bones back at least as a gesture of good faith
Youll give the Starks our reply cousin
I will Your Grace
Did you see my brother when you were the Starks guest
I did They have not broken his spirit Your Grace
If you speak with him tell him hes not been forgotten
I will Your Grace
Safe travels cousin
You have a deft hand with diplomacy
If thats everything
A raven flew in this morning from Castle Black
Trouble with the wildlings
Thats why theyre called wildlings
Somewhat less wild these days It seems theyve stopped killing each other and started following this KingBeyondtheWall
Another king How many is that now Five Ive lost count
Lord Commander asks that we send more men to man The Wall
Perhaps hes forgotten were fighting a war We have no men to spare
Cold winds are rising and the dead rise with them
The northerners are a superstitious people
According to the Commander one of these dead men attacked him in his chambers Mormont doesnt lie
How do you kill a dead man
Apparently you burn him
One trip to The Wall and you come back believing in grumpkins and snarks
I dont know what I believe but heres a fact for you The Nights Watch is the only thing that separates us from what lies beyond the Wall
I have every confidence the brave men of the Nights Watch will protect us all
Then I said if the gods wanted us to have dignity wouldnt make us fart when we died
We fart when we die
My blessed mother was holding her own when she left this world She farted so hard the whole bed shook
Seems a bit greedy for one man to have so many wives Wouldnt two or three be enough for him
We were having a serious discussion
Would you look at that
Nothing like the sight of a woman walking away
I prefer watching them come towards me
Im sure thats nice too
Well there was a milkmaid named Violet on the next farm over from where I grew up And we were wrestling together from the time we were six years old And then we got older the wrestling uh  changed
You were with her How many times
Well as many times as I could
Wish Id grew up on a farm
We need more potatoes And get another sack for the sludge Get the turnips too
No Ghost no No Ghost away Shoo Shoo You all right Did he frighten you
You shouldnt touch me
Oh oh Right Im sorry I just wanted to make sure you werent hurt
Youre very brave
Whatre you doing
This is Gilly shes one of Crasters daughters
Hello Gilly Whatre you doing
Sam said you could help
Im sorry Sam knows were not supposed to
Shes pregnant We have to take her with us when we leave
What
I know it sounds a bit mad
No it doesnt sound a bit mad its impossible
The Lord Commander  we are sworn to protect
Sam we cant take her
Please sir please I can still run if I have to
Its just not possible
Im going to have a baby if its a boy I
If its a boy what You want us to risk our lives for you and you wont even tell us why
Why did you do that
Do what ask her a question
You were cruel
Cruel Sam are you in such a hurry to lose a hand
I didnt touch her
No you just want to steal her What do you think Craster cuts off for that
I cant steal her shes a person not a goat
Were heading deeper and deeper into wildling territory We cant take a girl with us Mormont wouldnt have it And even if he would what would we do with her Whos gonna deliver her baby You
I could try What Ive read about it A bit
Im sorry Sam we cant help her
Khaleesi
You dont need to see this
He is blood of my blood
Who did this
Khal Pono perhaps Khal Jhaqo They dont like the idea of a woman leading a Khalasaar
They will like it far less when Im done with them
No They killed his soul
Shh They cannot kill his soul
They did They butchered him like an animal They did not burn his body He can never join his ancestors in the night lands
Shh We will build him a funeral pyre
And I promise you Rakharo will ride with his ancestors tonight
Is it as you remember my lord
Looks smaller
Everything looks bigger when youre a child I remember my fathers cabin felt like a palace when I was little Now look at it
Theyll be waiting for me on the docks
Who will
Anyone who matters  this is a big day for them They havent had much to get excited about since I left Its a hard place the Iron Islands always has been Its cold and its wet
I love the cold and wet
They say hard places breed hard men  and hard men rule the world
Then youll be king before long
Try smiling with your lips closed Hmm better
My father doesnt trust you Iron islanders
I dont blame him
He says that youre all reavers and rapers And that no matter how many women you have youll never be satis
Quit talking about your father Hes right about us Our wives from the Iron Islands theyre for breeding Thats not enough for us Thats why we take saltwives from the women we capture
Capture me Take me with you when you go ashore Make me your saltwife
Your place is on this ship
Not after you leave Father will punish me Hell call me a whore
I havent paid you
I barely touched her And you charge twice as much as every other brothel And this is what I get crying
One moment my friend A moment
Please accept my sincerest apologies Ramka will take good care of you
Im sorry my lord
Shhh Did he hurt you
No my lord Its Mhaegen
Who
She works for you Shes the one the girl whose they killed her baby
Ah yes that was poorly handled Sometimes those with the most power have the least grace
Cant stop thinking about it I cant sleep Her poor little baby
You know you remind me of another girl A lovely thing I once acquired from an Elysium pleasure house Beautiful like yourself and intelligent as yourself But she wasnt happy She cried often I asked her why but we didnt have the kind of rapport that you and I have Yes it was quite sad Girls from Elysium pleasure houses are expensive Extremely expensive And this one wasnt making me any money I hate bad investments Really I do They haunt me I had no idea how to make her happy no idea how to mitigate my losses A very wealthy patron he offered me a tremendous amount of money to let him transform this lovely sad girl To use her in ways that never occur to most men And you know what occurs to most men I would not say he succeeded in making her happy but my losses were definitely mitigated Take tonight off to mourn Mhaegens child Ill see you tomorrow But youll be happy That makes me happy
More wine
Damn it boy
Apologies my lord
Leave us Podrick I believe we know how to pour our own wine
Is that your new squire Could have found you a proper lad
Myself I prefer the improper ones
Hmm thats a good red Dornish
You know your wines my lord
That I do A fine dinner my lord
Call me Tyrion please Im sure youre getting used to fine dinners now that youre a lord
Maybe Ill hire this cook of yours
Wars have been started for less
I heard there was some trouble in Littlefingers brothel the other night
Hmm Nasty business had to be done
Yes of course City Watch must keep the peace Only I hadnt realized peace depended on killing babies
Orders are orders
Quite right Especially the queens orders
I never said they were the queens orders
No but who else would want to murder King Roberts bastards Shes always been a jealous woman
You know your sister better than I do
Youve heard the awful rumors about my brother and sister
I dont listen to filth
Thats good of you but you have heard them I suppose people who do believe that filth consider Roberts bastards to be better claimants to the throne than Cerseis children
Joffrey is my king the rest doesnt interest me
I appreciate your loyalty Tell me When your men slaughtered Ned Starks men in the throne room did you give the order
I did And I would again The man was a traitor He tried to buy my loyalty
The fool He had no idea you were already bought
Are you drunk Ill not have my honor questioned by an Imp
Im not questioning your honor Lord Janos Im denying its existence
You think Ill stand here and take this from you dwarf
Dwarf You should have stopped at imp And yes you will stand here and take it from me unless youd like to take it from my friend here
I intend to serve as Hand of the King until my father returns from the war and seeing as you betrayed the last Hand of the King well I just wouldnt feel safe with you lurking about
What are you ta My friends at court will not allow this The queen herself
The queen regent And youre a fool to believe shes your friend
We shall hear what Joffrey has to say about this
No we shant
Theres a ship leaving for East Watch by the sea tonight From there Im afraid its rather a long walk to Castle Black I hope you enjoy the Wall I found it surprisingly beautiful in a brutal horribly uncomfortable sort of way
The lads will escort you The streets arent safe at night my lord
These men are under my command I command you to arrest this cutthroat
His name is Bronn and he is the new commander of the City Watch
Boys
I have friends at court Powerful friends The king himself made me a lordJanos is escorted out of view Bronn sits down and Tyrion pours him a cup of wine
To the new Commander
If I told you to murder an infant girl say still at her mothers breast would you do it without question
Without question No Id ask how much
If they come back I say we yield Gendrys the one they want I dont want to get caught in the middle of a battle
Im not afraid of no battles
If you got within a mile of a battle youd fill your pants
Ive seen lots of battles I saw
Liar
I saw a man kill another man just outside a tavern in Flea Bottom Stabbed him right in the neck
Two men fighting isnt a battle
They had armor on
So
So if they got armor on its a battle
No it isnt
Whats a dyers apprentice know about battles anyway
Gendrys an armorers apprentice Hot Pie tell Gendry what makes it a battle
Its when theyve got armor on
Now who told you that
A knight
Howd you know he was a knight
Well cause he got armor on
You dont have to be a knight to have armor Any idiot can buy armor
Howd you know
Cause I sold armor
What do the gold cloaks want with you
No idea
Youre a liar
You shouldnt insult people that are bigger than you
Then I wouldnt get to insult anyone
Well I dont care what any of them want No goods ever come of their questions
No goods ever come Who asked questions before
How can someone so small be such a huge pain in my ass
Who asked questions
The Hand of the King Er hands of the King Lord Arryn came first a few weeks before he died And then Lord Stark came a few weeks before he died
Lord Stark
See Asking me questions is bad luck Youll probably be dead soon
What did they ask about
My mom
Whos your mom
Just my mom Worked in a tavern Died when I was little
And who was your father
He could be one of those goldhatted bastards for all I know What about you anyway You thought they were after you why Did you kill someone or is it just because youre a girl
Im not a girl
Yes you are You think Im as stupid as the rest of them
Stupider Nights Watch doesnt take girls everyone knows that
Thats true Youre still a girl
I am not
Well pull your cock out and take a piss then
I dont need to take a piss Lommy and Hot Pie cant know No one can know
They wont Not from me
My names not Arry Its Arya Of House Stark Yoren is taking me home to Winterfell
He was your father The Hand The traitor
He was never a traitor Joffrey is a liar
So youre a highborn then Youre a lady
No I mean yes My mother was a lady and my sister
You were a lords daughter and you lived in a castle Look all that about cocks I should never have said that Ive been pissing in front of you and everything I should be calling you milady
Do not call me milady
As milady commands Well that was unladylike The scene starts with a wide shot of the busy docks Theon stands in a rowboat as is comes up against the side of a wall He gets out and walks up some stairs An old man spots him
What you carrying
Pears and oranges Wine from the Arbor And the heir to Pyke of the Iron Islands The only living son of Balon Greyjoy Me
Dont like wine Womans drink
I need to get to Pyke
Ill find you a horse
Im heading that way I can take you there
I bet you can
You been at sea long Or were there just no women where you came from
None like you
You dont know what Im like
You dont know what youre like You need someone to teach you Know who I am
You think I offer free rides to every man in jewelry Lord Greyjoy
Have my things sent up to the castle
You should give me the reins Im a better rider than you Ive been on horseback for the last nine years
Nine years Do you still know your way around a ship Have these hands ever touched a rope
Dont you worry about my hands The seas in my blood
Your blood will be in the sea if I dont watch where Im going
I have a proposal for my father One that will make him king again And me after him You may stay at the castle tonight if youre lucky
Is that an offer from my future king
An order from your future king You can tell your grandchildren about this night
I dont imagine it will be a story fit for children
Father
Nine years is it They took a frightened boy What have they given back
A man Your blood and your heir
We shall see Stark had you longer than I did
Lord Stark is gone
And how do you feel about that
Whats done is done Ive brought you a proposal from Robb Stark
Who gave you those clothes Was it Ned Starks pleasure to make you his daughter
If my clothes offend you I will change them
It will That bauble around your neck Did you pay the iron price for it or the gold I asked a question Did you pull it from the neck of a corpse you made or did you buy it to match your fine clothes Iron or gold
Gold
Ill not have my son dressed as a whore My fears have come true The Starks have made you theirs
My blood is salt and iron
Yet  the Stark boy sends you to me like a trained raven clutching his message
The offer he makes is one I proposed
He heeds your counsel
Ive lived with him hunted with him fought at his side he thinks of me as a brother
No not here  not in my hearing you will not name him brother This son of the man who put your true brothers to the sword Or have you forgotten your own blood
I forget nothing I remember my brothers And I remember when my father was a king
I see I destroy Robb Starks enemies for him and he will make me King of the Iron Islands once again
I will lead the attack myself
Oh you will
Im your son Your only living heir Who else
I told you to wait outside How did you get past the guards
Anything with a cock is easy to fool
My dear
Yara
So good to see you brother This is a homecoming Ill tell my grandchildren about
She cant lead an attack
And why not
Youre a woman
Youre the one in skirts
This isnt Winterfell boy Your sister took over command of your eldest brothers ship after your new father killed him
Whats dead may never die The only night shes spent off these islands has been spent on the sea Shes commanded men Shes killed men She knows who she is
No man gives me a crown I pay the iron price I will take my crown That is who I am That is who we have always been
You wont stand a chance against the Lannisters on your own
Who said anything about the Lannisters
Youll have your gold when we take the treasury at Kings Landing
All these kings fighting for the throne and this Stannis has the smallest army Why would I bet on the man with the worst chance
Because youre a smart gambler Stannis has proved himself in war Twice His baby brother has never set foot on a battlefield Neither has the false king Joffrey
And yet they both have larger armies
Stannis has just begun the fight His bannermen will rally to his cause Theres no man in the Seven Kingdoms more honorable than Stannis Baratheon Or more worthy of loyalty
What is the world coming to when smugglers must vouch for the honor of kings
Mind your words pirate
Matthos
You think Im insulted I am a pirate Im an excellent pirate I dont sail for promises
Of course you do Every time you leave harbor youre leaving on a promise A promise that somewhere on the seas somebodys got some gold and you can take it from them
Thats a promise that always comes true
As is mine Youre not the young man Salladhor And correct me if Im wrong Most pirates dont grow old
Only the clever ones
You want to spend your last few years on the sea stealing from Pentoshi cheesemongers and Midanese silk merchants then go Theyre out there waiting for you Thats easy What Im offering you is hard Come with me and plunder the greatest city in Westeros Youll be the richest man in Lysene And the most famous Theyll be singing songs about you as long as men have voices to sing
Salladhor Saan is a good name for songs
It is
One thing I want the queen
The queen
Cersei I want her Ill sail with your fleet all 30 of my ships and if we dont drown at the bottom of Blackwater Bay I will fuck this blonde queen and I will fuck her well
This war isnt about you Were not attacking Kings Landing so that you can rape the queen
Im not going to rape her Im going to fuck her
As if she would just let you
You dont know how persuasive I am I never tried to fuck you
Stannis is the rightful king and the Lord of Light The one true god
Ive been all over the world my boy and everywhere I go people tell me about the true god They all think they found the right one The one true god is whats between a womans legs and better yet a queens legs
I never thought youd have a true believer for a son
Hes young yet I promise you the gold I promise you the glory I cannot promise you the queen
You believe your king can win
He is the one true king
You Westerosee are funny people A man chops off your fingers and you fall in love with him Ill sail with you Davos Seaworth You are the most honest smuggler I ever met Make me rich
Get me to the gates of Kings Landing and I will
When will the King have a sail
As soon as his God wills it
Hes my God too and yours But you were too blind to see Let me teach you how to read
Oh you and your mother
It wont take long You already know the letters The holy books are much more persuasive than I can be
I wish I had a God truly Im not mocking you but Ive seen men pray to every God there is Pray for wind pray for rain pray for home None of it works
But you always came home
I wasnt praying
But I was Every night that you were at sea I lit a candle and I prayed for you
You want me to have a god fine King Stannis is my god He raised me up and blessed me with his trust He gave you a future I could never have imagined You know how to read youll be a knight someday You think your fire god commanded all that It was Stannis Only Stannis
Stannis is my king but hes only a man
Dont tell him that
Lord Janos Slynt was Commander of the City Watch You had no right to exile him
I have every right I am the Kings Hand
Youre serving as the Kings Hand until father gets here I am Queen Regent
Listen to me Queen Regent youre losing the people Do you hear me
Ha the people You think I care
You might find it difficult to rule over millions who want you dead Half the city will starve when winter comes The other half will plot to overthrow you And your goldplated thugs just gave them the rallying cry The Queen slaughters babies You dont even have the decency to deny it
It wasnt you who gave the order was it Joffrey didnt even tell you Or did he tell you I imagine that would be even worse
He did what needed to be done You want to be the Hand of the King You want to rule This is what ruling is Lying on a bed of weeds ripping them out by the root one by one before they strangle you in your sleep
Im no king but I think theres more to ruling that that
I dont care what you think Youve never taken it seriously You havent Jaime hasnt Its all fallen on me
As has Jaime repeatedly according to Stannis Baratheon
Youre funny Youve always been funny But none of your jokes will ever match the first one will they You remember back when you ripped my mother open on your way out of her and she bled to death
She was my mother too
Now theyre gone for the sake of you Theres no bigger joke in the world than that
Your Grace
Your Grace
How did it fare with your pirate
Salladhor Saan will join our fleet 30 ships His men know how to fight
In my experience pirates prefer fighting unarmed men
Does seem the wiser choice
It wont be a choice this time Do you trust him
Salladhor Saan is an old friend Ive known him 30 years Ive never trusted him But once he gets the smell of gold he never stops
Well if he does his job hell have his share Leave us
At once Your Grace
The Lord of Light shines through you young warrior
Come
What did you say to him
I told him death by fire is the purest death
Why
Because it is true Youre troubled my king
Yeah
These armies are but toys for the Lord of Light
Tell your lord to burn them then
I tell him nothing I pray for his commands and I obey
My little brother has a hundred thousand men according to the scouts Men whose allegiance rightly belongs to me
You must have faith
Faith In a real war the side with the greater number wins nine times out of ten
Then we must be the ten
I cannot defeat my brother in the field and I cant take Kings Landing without the men he stole
I have seen the path to victory in the flames At first you must give yourself to the Lord of Light
Ive said the words damn you I burnt the idols
You must give all of yourself
I have a wife I took a vow
Shes sick Weak Shut away in the tower And she disgusts you And shes given you nothing No sons Only stillborns Only death I will give you a son my King
A son
Out all of you This bastards been meddling where he shouldnt I want you and your men gone And you will make this right
Wait outside
Lord Commander
Now
Lord Commander
Leave us
What did you do
I followed him He took the baby into the woods the newborn
What business is that of yours
No you dont understand Hes killing them all the boys
You know
Wildlings serve crueler gods than you or I Those boys are Crasters offerings
Offerings Hes murdering his own children Hes a monster
Aye many a time that monster has been the difference between life and death for our rangers your uncle among them We have other wars to fight out there Like it or not we need men like Craster
I saw it I saw something take that child
Yeah Whatever it was I daresay youll see it again Now ready my horse We leave at dawn
Dont lose it again
Gilly
Youre leaving
I I wanted to give you something It belonged to my mother
I cant take it
Please I want you to My mother used it for sewing Shed let me sit with her in her chamber while she sewed and Id read to her My father put a stop to it when he found out Its the only thing I have of hers She gave it to me before I left for the Wall
You You shouldnt give it away
Im not giving it away Im giving it to you Keep it safe for me Till I come back
Hodor Rouse Bran will you Its time for his lessons
Every night its the same Im walking and running but Im not Im not me Im running through the godswood sniffing the dirt tasting blood in my mouth when Ive made a fresh kill howling Old Nan used to tell me stories about magical people who could live inside stags birds wolves
Thats exactly what they are Bran stories
So she was lying They dont exist
Well they may have done But theyre gone from the world along with much else These are dreams Bran nothing more
No my dreams are different Mine are true I dreamt of my father dying And Rickon had the same dream
What about all the dreams you had that didnt come true Hmm Right
This link is made of Valyrian steel Only one maester in 100 wears it on his chain It signifies that I have studied the higher mysteries And all who study these mysteries try their hand at spells I was no different I was young And what boy doesnt secretly wish for hidden powers to lift him out of his dull life into a special one But in the end for all my efforts I got no more out of it than a thousand boys before me Come on
All right Maybe magic once was a mighty force in the world But not anymore The dragons are gone The giants are dead And the Children of the Forest forgotten An exhibition fight between two armored knights ensues with RENLY an watching on CATELYN and COLEN OF GREENPOOLS enter and watch from among the crowd LORAS lands a solid blow
Loras Highgarden
Get him
Oh
Yield I yield
Well fought Approach
Rise Remove your helm
You are all your father promised and more my lady Ive seen Ser Loras bested once or twice but never quite in that fashion
Now now my love My brother fought valiantly for you
That he did my queen But there can only be one champion Brienne of Tarth you may ask anything of me you desire If it is within my power it is yours
Your Grace I ask the honor of a place in your Kingsguard
What
I will be one of your seven pledge my life to yours and keep you safe from all harm
Done Rise Brienne of the Kingsguard
Your Grace I have the honor to bring you Lady Catelyn Stark sent as an envoy by her son Robb Lord of Winterfell
Lord of Winterfell and King in the North
Lady Catelyn Im pleased to see you May I present my wife Margaery of House Tyrell
You are very welcome here Lady Stark Im so sorry for your loss
You are most kind
My lady I swear to you I will see the Lannisters answer for your husbands murder When I take Kings Landing Ill bring you Joffreys head
It will be enough to know that justice was done my lord Your Grace
And you should kneel when you approach the King
Theres no need for that Lady Stark is an honored guest
Has your son marched against Tywin Lannister yet
I do not sit on my sons war councils And if I did I would not share his strategies with you
If Robb Stark wants a pact with us he should come himself not hide behind his mothers skirts
My son is fighting a war not playing at one
Dont worry my lady Our war is just beginning
Your Grace
Gerard Hows your foot
Better Your Grace They dont know their own size is all
Good man
I have 100000 men at my command All the might of the Stormlands and the Reach
And all of them young and bold like your Knight of Flowers Its a game to you isnt it I pity them
Why
Because it wont last Because they are the knights of summer and winter is coming
Brienne escort Lady Catelyn to her tent Shes tired from her journey
At once Your Grace Shall I return after
That wont be necessary I would pray awhile Alone
If youll follow me my lady
You fought bravely today Lady Brienne
I fought for my king Soon Ill fight for him on the battlefield Die for him if I must And if it please you Briennes enough Im no lady
What are you doing here
I live here Are you angry with me brother
You lying bitch
Its not my fault you didnt recognize me
Recognize you How could I The last time I saw you you looked like a fat little boy
You were a fat little boy too but I recognized you
Why didnt you tell me
I wanted to see who you were first And I did
The plans are made Its time you heard them
Father
Father
The wolf pup has gone south with the entirety of the Northern army at his back While hes tangling with the lion in the Westerlands the North is ripe for the taking The ironborn will reave and pillage as it was in the old days all along the northern coast Well spread our dominion across the green lands securing the Neck and everything above Every stronghold will yield to us one by one Winterfell may defy us for a year but what of it The rest shall be ours forest field and hall Yara my daughter youll take 30 longships to attack Deepwood Motte
Ive always wanted a castle
And whats my role in all this
Youll take a ship to raid the fishing villages on the Stoney Shore
A ship You give her 30 and I get one
The Sea Bitch We thought shed be perfect for you
Im to fight fishermen
Be careful of their nets
Father I fought with Robb Stark I know his men He wont give up the North so easily
They wont even know were there until its too late
What do you know of it woman Im a proven warrior
Your brothers were warriors both of them dead at the hands of those you seem so eager to protect
Im not protecting anyone I just wonder if its not wiser to wait Why risk going against the North if they would be our allies Rise up against them and they could destroy us But if we pledge fealty to them theyll give us Casterly Rock
What are our words Our words
We do not sow
We do not sow We are ironborn Were not subjects Were not slaves We do not plow the fields or toil in the mine We take what is ours Your time with the wolves has made you weak
You act as if I volunteered to go You gave me away if you remember The day you bent the knee to Robert Baratheon After he crushed you Did you take what was yours then
You gave me away Your boy Your last boy You gave me away like I was some dog you didnt want anymore And now you curse me because Ive come home
Youd have our father bow down to your other family
I have no other family
Dont you Make your choice Theon and do it quickly Our ships sail with or without you
You wont let me leave this room You wont let me
Keep your voice down
Why You think your father can hear me Hes 300 miles away
I dont intend for you to stay here I might be able to bring you into the castle kitchens Again only temporary
Every man who has tasted my cooking has told me what a good whore I am
But you wouldnt be a cook Youd pose as a scullion
Scullion What is a scullion
Kitchen wench
A kitchen wench
Yes
Cleaning pots Is that how my lion wants to see me
Your lion wants to see you alive Weve come to a dangerous place My sister wants to hurt me Shell look for any weakness she can find She cant know about you
Im the weakness
Its a compliment my lady
How is being a weakness a compliment
Language can be a bit tricky here
Oh Im too stupid to understand The stupid foreign girl I am not a kitchen wench
When will Joffrey and Sansa be married
Soon darling when the war is over
Mother says Ill have a new gown for the ceremony and another for the feast But yours will be ivory since youre the bride
The princess just spoke to you
Pardon Your Grace Im sure your dress will be beautiful Myrcella Im counting the days until the fighting is done and I can pledge my love to the King in sight of the gods

Im Shae My Lady Your new handmaiden
I didnt know I needed a new handmaiden Youre not from here
No
What are you doing
Waiting for you to tell me what to do
I shouldnt have to tell you to do things You should just do them
What things
Change my linens wash my clothing scrub the floor empty my chamber pot brush my hair
No
You said to brush
Not now
Your chamber pot is empty
Clean the table Have you ever been a handmaiden before
Yes
For whom
Lady Zuriff
Lady Zuriff
Lady Zuriff
There is no Lady Zuriff in this city
She wasnt in this city
I dont know how they did things in that city but in this city handmaidens wait on ladies not the other way around And I dont have time to answer a thousand questions and teach you how to do your job
Do you want me to leave
Just brush my hair
Oh Thank the gods I havent had a proper shit in six days
Ive encountered this problem before my lord The stresses of power often have this insalubrious effect Two drops with water daily
Right Im so grateful to have a man of your vast knowledge and wisdom on my side
Please Thank you my lord
I can trust you Pycelle can I not
Why yes of course my lord
These are perilous times And the crown must forge new alliances And these alliances must often be sealed in matrimony
Matrimony huh Yes
Im trusting the council with these plans but the Queen mustnt know We cant have her meddling in affairs that could determine the future of the realm Theres too much at stake
Oh yes yes Indeed yes I shall be silent as the grave
Im brokering an alliance with House Martell of Dorne Princess Myrcella will wed their youngest son when she comes of age ensuring their loyalty and their army should we need it
Myrcella sent away to Dorne
But remember the Queen mustnt know
Ooh The Queen mustnt know I love conversations that begin this way
I plan to marry Princess Myrcella off to Theon Greyjoy
Theon Greyjoy Forgive me my lord but how He grew up a ward of Winterfell He fights for Robb Stark
Precisely Theons father loathes the Starks and will convince the boy to come to our side Greyjoy can destroy the Northern army from within and we can have his fathers ships
But remember you must tell no one
Tell no one what
I plan to wed Princess Myrcella to Robin Arryn of the Vale Lysa is not fond of me But perhaps the promise of a royal match will convince her to let bygones be bygones
She imprisoned you She tried to execute you And you offer her son a princess
For men in our position holding grudges can be an encumbrance dont you think
And I suppose you want me to broker this agreement
Who better
Yes I could sing this song to Lysa if I cared to Whats in it for me
The gratitude of the people of Westeros for helping to end this war the adoration of the King for bringing the Vale back into the fold and Harrenhal
Harrenhal is cursed
Never took you for a superstitious man By all means tear it down and rebuild Youll be able to afford it I plan to make you Lord of the Riverlands
With a single stroke youd make me one of the greatest lords in the realm
You served my family well in the matter of the succession
So did Janos Slynt and he was given Harrenhal too Until you snatched it away
I need you to deliver Lysa Arryn I didnt need Janos Slynt Its settled then
Good Oh
The Queen mustnt know
That must hurt
What What is it
A member of the Kingsguard As if I wasnt humiliated enough already
Brienne is a very capable warrior And shes devoted to me Youre jealous
Jealous Of Brienne the Beauty Dont make me laugh
Ill make it up to you
No Your Grace Not tonight Theres another Tyrell who requires your attention You didnt win my fathers support or his army on charm alone
Your vassals are starting to snigger behind your back Brides arent usually virgins two weeks after their wedding night
And Margaerys a virgin
Officially Shall I bring her to you
I should warn you Ive had quite a bit of wine
As is your right You are a king
You look very beautiful
Thank you Your Grace
Its a lovely gown
You think so I cant decide how I like it better This way or this way
You certainly dont need it
Although some say the beauty most desired is the beauty concealed
Must be the wine
Here let me
Im sorry
Do you want my brother to come in and help
What
He could get you started I know he wouldnt mind Or I can turn over and you can pretend Im him
I dont know what youre talking about
Theres no need for us to play games Save your lies for court Youre going to need a lot of them
Your enemies arent happy about us They want to tear us apart And the best way to stop them is to put your baby in my belly We can try again later You decide how you want to do it with me with me and Loras however else you like Whatever you need to do You are a king
You monster Myrcella is my only daughter Do you really think Ill let you sell her like a common whore
Myrcellas a princess Some would say she was born for this
I will not let you ship her off to Dorne as I was shipped off to Robert Baratheon
Dorne is the safest place for her
Are you mad The Martells loathe us
Thats why we need to seduce them Were going to need their support in the war your son started
Shell be a hostage
A guest
You wont get away with this You think the piece of paper Father gave you keeps you safe Ned Stark had a piece of paper too
Its done Cersei
No
You cannot stop it
No
Just how safe do you think Myrcella is if this city falls Do you want to see her raped butchered like the Targaryen children Make no mistake Theyll mount her pretty little head on a spike right beside yours
Get out Get out
Theon of the House Greyjoy you would this day consecrate your faith to the Drowned God
I would
Kneel
Let Theon your servant be born again from the sea as you were Bless him with salt Bless him with stone Bless him with steel
What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die But rises again harder and stronger Stand
I dont appreciate being made a fool of dwarf If Myrcella marries the Martell boy she cant very well marry Robin Arryn can she
No afraid not Sorry about that
And Harrenhal I suppose thats off the table as well
Yes I fear so Sorry about that too
Leave me out of your next deception
Thats a shame You were to be the centerpiece of my next deception My brother Jaime rots in a northern stockade I would see him released Thats where you come in
Robb Stark will never release the Kingslayer
No he wont But his mother might How would you like to see your beloved Cat again
Find him
Oh aye And he has company Filthy old stoat Almost hate to interrupt
No you dont
No I dont
What is the meaning of this No please please
You disappoint me Grand Maester
I am your loyal servant
So loyal that you told the Queen about my plans to send Myrcella to Dorne
No Never Its a falsehood I swear it It wasnt me Ah Varys It was Varys the Spider
See I told Varys that I was giving the Princess to the Greyjoys I told Littlefinger that I planned to wed her to Robin Arryn I told no one that I was offering her to the Dornish No one but you
The eunuch has spies everywhere
Cut off his manhood and feed it to the goats
No no no
There are no goats halfman
Well make do
How long have you been spying for my sister
All I did I did for House Lannister Always Your lord father ask him Ive always been his servant since the days of the Mad King
I dont like his beard
What What
No No
How many Hands have you betrayed Pycelle Eddard Stark Jon Arryn
Lord Arryn he knew He knew the truth about the Queen And he planned to act to tell King Robert
So you poisoned him
No Never
But you let him die made sure he succumbed
Lannister I always served Lannister
Get him out of my sight Throw him in one of the black cells
No No no no No please Dont You cant do this to me
For your trouble
Youll be pleased to know our mutual friend is doing quite well in Lady Sansas service
Good One of my better ideas
And it seems the Grand Maester has found his way into a black cell Well played My Lord Hand But should I be worried Janos Slynt Pycelle The Small Council grows smaller every day
The Council has a reputation for serving past Hands poorly I dont mean to follow Ned Stark to the grave
Power is a curious thing my lord Are you fond of riddles
Why am I about to hear one
Three great men sit in a room A king a priest and a rich man Between them stands a common sellsword Each great man bids the sellsword kill the other two Who lives who dies
Depends on the sellsword
Does it He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods
He has a sword the power of life and death
But if its swordsmen who rule why do we pretend kings hold all the power When Ned Stark lost his head who was truly responsible Joffrey The executioner Or something else
Ive decided I dont like riddles
Power resides where men believe it resides Its a trick a shadow on the wall And a very small man can cast a very large shadow
You should be sleeping Tomorrows a long march Thirty miles if it dont piss on us
I cant sleep
I dont like the taste
You dont drink it for the flavor to be honest What
How do you sleep
Same as most men I think
But youve seen things horrible things
Aye Ive seen some pretty things too but not nearly so many
How do you sleep when you When you have those things in your head
You didnt see that I made damn sure
I close my eyes and I see them up there All of them standing there Joffrey the Queen and and my sister
You know weve got something in common me and you You know that I must have been a couple of years older than you I saw my brother stabbed through the heart right on our doorstep He werent much of a villain what skewered him Willem the lads name was He ran off before anyone could spit And I just stood there watching my brother die Heres the funny part I cant picture my brothers face anymore But Willem oh he was a nicelooking boy He had good white teeth blue eyes one of those dimpled chins all the girls like I would think about him when I was working when I was drinking when I was having a shit It got to the point where I would say his name every night before I went to bed Willem Willem Willem A prayer almost Well one day Willem came riding back into town I buried an ax so deep into Willems skull they had to bury him with it Willems horse got me to the Wall and Ive been wearing black ever since Well Thatll help you sleep eh
Ho Get up you lazy sons of whores Arm yourselves
Get up

This is your last chance In the name of King Joffrey drop your weapons

Something wrong with your leg boy
Look at it

All right
Carry him he says
Were looking for a bastard named Gendry Give him up or Ill start taking eyeballs
Its got to be the Mountain Hes the biggest Hes the strongest
Bulls are bigger than lions Doesnt mean Id pick a bull in a fight
If the bull had fangs and claws I would Right the Mountain or our man Jaime
If he ever gets out
Loras Tyrell
Loras Tyrell Hes prettier than the Queen
I dont care about pretty Hes better with a sword than any of them
How good could he be Hes been stabbing Renly Baratheon for years and Renly aint dead
The horses seem a little spooked to you Theyre horses
They get spooked by their own shadows
Shh Do you hear that
No
Theres something out there
Oh Oh youre a right little prick You should see your face
I swear you pissed yourself Oh who goes there Ahh
There is something out there
Yeah dont even try me
Rennick
Do you think Im an idiot
Rennick
King in the North
ing in the North
Five Lannisters dead for every one of ours Theyre dead Take everything theyve got Weve nowhere to keep all these prisoners Barely enough food to feed our own
Were not executing prisoners Lord Bolton
Of course Your Grace The officers will be useful Some of them may be privy to Tywin Lannisters plans
I doubt it
Well well learn soon enough In my family we say A naked man has few secrets A flayed man none
My father outlawed flaying in the North
Were not in the North
Were not torturing them
The high roads very pretty but youll have a hard time marching your army down it
The Lannisters hold prisoners of their own I wont give them an excuse to abuse my sisters
No dont Dont Please
The rots set in
No dont No dont
Shh
Please dont Itll get better It doesnt even hurt
The rot will spread If we dont take the foot now WOUNDED
No you cant
Ser Please ser
Youll die if she doesnt
I dont want to be a cripple please
Surely one of our men needs your attention more than this cub
Your men are not my men my lord
Put this in your mouth and lie down You dont want to watch
No You cant
Bite on it Its better than biting your own tongue believe me
Whats your name
Talisa
Your last name
You want to know what side my family fights on
You know my family name You have me at a disadvantage
That boy lost his foot on your orders
They killed my father
That boy did
The family he fights for
Do you think hes friends with King Joffrey Hes a fishermans son that grew up near Lannisport He probably never held a spear before they shoved one in his hands a few months ago
I have no hatred for the lad
That should help his foot grow back
Youd have us surrender end all this bloodshed I understand The country would be at peace and life would be just under the righteous hand of good King Joffrey
Youre going to kill Joffrey
If the gods give me strength
And then what
I dont know Well go back to Winterfell I have no desire to sit on the Iron Throne
So who will
I dont know
Youre fighting to overthrow a king and yet you have no plan for what comes after
First we have to win the war
You never told me where youre from
Volantis
Volantis Youre far from home The boy was lucky you were here
He was unlucky that you were
Youre here to answer for your brothers latest treasons
Your Grace whatever my traitor brother has done I had no part You know that I beg you
Ser Lancel tell her of this outrage
Using some vile sorcery your brother fell on Stafford Lannister with an army of wolves Thousands of good men were butchered After the slaughter the Northmen feasted on the flesh of the slain
Killing you would send your brother a message
But my mother insists on keeping you alive Stand So well have to send your brother a message some other way Meryn
Leave her face I like her pretty
Meryn my lady is overdressed Unburden her
If you want Robb Stark to hear us were going to have to speak louder
What is the meaning of this
What kind of knight beats a helpless girl
The kind who serves his king Imp
Careful now We dont want to get blood all over your pretty white cloak
Someone get the girl something to cover herself with She is to be your queen Have you no regard for her honor
Im punishing her
For what crimes She did not fight her brothers battle you halfwit
You cant talk to me like that The king can do as he likes
The Mad King did as he liked Has your Uncle Jaime ever told you what happened to him
No one threatens His Grace in the presence of the Kingsguard
Im not threatening the king ser I am educating my nephew Bronn the next time Ser Meryn speaks kill him That was a threat See the difference
I apologize for my nephews behavior Tell me the truth Do you want an end to this engagement
I am loyal to King Joffrey my one true love
Lady Stark you may survive us yet
The little kings backed up Clogged from balls to brains
You think dipping his wick will cure what ails him
Theres no cure for being a cunt But the boys at that age And hes got nothing to do all day but pick wings off flies Couldnt hurt to get some of the poison out
What are you doing here dog
Your uncle left your nameday present and asked me to see that you got it
And What is it
Look inside Your Grace
Your Grace
Happy nameday Your Grace
My nameday has passed
We wont tell if you wont
No Her Touch her
Could you hit her
My uncle sent you
Yes Your Grace He chose us himself
Hmm
Use this
Harder
I said harder Hed want me to get his moneys worth
Your Grace too much pain will spoil the pleasure
Please Your Grace
Your Grace if your uncle finds out
Oh I want him to find out You will bring her to his chambers when youre finished and show him what youve done or the same thing will happen to you
Begin
Harder
Well if it isnt my favorite whoremonger Pray I havent kept you waiting long
Your Grace
Now you do the Lannisters bidding is that it Tell me was my brothers body even cold before you secured your newest patron
Im a practical man
Just not a loyal one
And who would you have me be loyal to Your brothers corpse
I dont like you Lord Baelish I dont like your face I dont like the words that come oozing out of your mouth I dont want you in my tent one minute more than necessary So tell me why are you here
You can trust Brienne Her loyalty comes without charge
You still have many friends at court Your Grace many who believe Ned Stark erred by not supporting your claim
Now I understand You know I have the numbers You know Im marching on Kings Landing When I take the throne you hope to retain your position And your head
I would give priority to my head
I understand that you dont like me and while that saddens me greatly I did not come here today seeking your affection When you march on Kings Landing you may find yourself facing a protracted siege or open gates
Your Grace
Lord Baelish
All of these tents look the same to me Would you be so kind
It would be my pleasure It took me weeks to learn my way around the camp Twice I walked in on officers in stages of undress And the moment I learn which tent is mine were on the move again
Your tent  Not Our tent  The king snores perhaps Or simply prefers solitude Pressures of command no doubt Four kings vying for the throne
I am not tutored in warfare but basic arithmetic favors the side with the greater numbers
If war were arithmetic the mathematicians would rule the world I did notice your brother entering His Graces tent just now
The place of a Kingsguard is by the kings side
And on the night of your wedding who was by the kings side then
You seem quite interested in our marriage
Your marriage is quite interesting Not only to me but to the realm The marriage of a wealthy girl always breeds interest if nothing else
Youve never married have you
Ive been unlucky in my affections sadly
That is sad Though perhaps its for the best The whole notion of marriage seems to confuse you so allow me to explain My husband is my king and my king is my husband Here is your tent Lord Baelish Good night
This isnt your horse
It was given to me by the Thirteen The Elders of Qarth
Qarth
Three days to the east on the sea
Will they let us in
They said they would be honored to receive the Mother of Dragons
What do you know of this place
Only that the desert around their walls is called the Garden of Bones Every time the Qartheen shut their gates on a traveler the garden grows
Go on
You keep moving
Bring her about
What kind of fire melts stone
Dragon fire
Theres dragons here
No all the dragons are dead
Whats that smell
Dead people
Move
Please please no no No
Hes dead He was my son My sister was three days ago My husband the day before that
They take someone every day
Does anyone live
Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound
How dare you
You may have heard false reports
You betrayed Ned
Betrayed I wanted him to serve as Protector of the Realm I begged him to seize the moment
I trusted you My husband trusted you And you repaid our faith with treachery
No my lady
Get out
Cat Ive Ive loved you since I was a boy It seems to me that fate has given us this chance
Have you lost your mind Get out
Do you want to see your girls again Sansa more beautiful than ever And Arya just as wild as ever
You have Arya too
Both girls are healthy and safe For now But you know the Queen and you know Joffrey I fear for their longevity if they remain in the capital
What do you want
The Lannisters will trade your daughters for the Kingslayer
Of course they will Jaime Lannister for two girls Robb will never agree to those terms
Im not bringing these terms to him Im bringing them to you
You think I keep secrets from my son
Robb has surprised them all with his skills in battle but hes not a mother Consider it Cat You may not get another chance Ive brought you a gift
I dont want your gifts A token of Tyrion Lannisters goodwill He wants you to understand that this exchange of prisoners is offered in good faith
Good faith
Whats this
Your husband was an honorable man He should rest beside his family in the crypts beneath Winterfell You may not believe
Get out
Get up you dogs
Thats him the one who picks
The Mountain What are you doing
He told me he stares at him every day Thats why he doesnt get picked
You
Move boy Move
Is there gold and silver in the village
I dont know
Gems
I didnt see any
Where is the Brotherhood
I dont know
Where is the Brotherhood
I dont know Please
Where is the Brotherhood
I dont know
Which of the villagers aided them
I dont know
Who
I
Who
I never saw Please Please stop Please
Who
I didnt see anyone help him Take it off Take it off
Who helped him
Ganes the butcher and his son
Thats better Youve been very helpful
No stop please What are you doing Please stop Please stop
No No I told you everything No No
Joffrey Cersei llyn Payne The Hound
Please Polliver Some food Just a crust of bread
Polliver The Mountain
Lady Stark I had not thought to find you in the Stormlands
I had not thought to be here Lord Stannis
Can that truly be you
Who else might it be
When I saw your standard I couldnt be sure Whose banner is that
My own
I suppose if we used the same one the battle would be terribly confusing Why is your stag on fire
The king has taken for his sigil the fiery heart of the Lord of Light
Ah you must be this fire priestess we hear so much about Mmm brother now I understand why you found religion in your old age
Watch yourself Renly
No no Im relieved I never really believed you were a fanatic Charmless rigid a bore yes but not a godly man
You should kneel before your brother Hes the Lords chosen born amidst salt and smoke
Born amidst salt and smoke Is he a ham
Thats twice Ive warned you
Listen to yourselves If you were sons of mine I would knock your heads together and lock you in a bedchamber until you remembered that you were brothers
It is strange to find you beside my brother Lady Stark Your husband was a supporter of my claim Lord Eddards integrity cost him his head And you sit beside this pretender and chastise me
We share a common enemy
The Iron Throne is mine by right All those that deny that are my foes
The whole realm denies it from Dorne to the Wall Old men deny it with their death rattle and unborn children deny it in their mothers wombs No one wants you for their king You never wanted any friends brother But a man without friends is a man without power
For the sake of the mother who bore us I will give you this one night to reconsider Strike your banners come to me before dawn and I will grant you your old seat in the Council Ill even name you my heir until a son is born to me Otherwise I shall destroy you
Look across those fields brother Can you see all those banners
You think a few bolts of cloth will make you king
No The men holding those bolts of cloth will make me king
We shall see Renly Come the dawn we shall see
Look to your sins Lord Renly The night is dark and full of terrors
Would you believe I loved him once
I thought we were welcome
If you heard a Dothraki horde was approaching your city you might do the same Khaleesi
Horde
My name is Daenerys SPICE
Daenerys Stormborn of the house Targaryen
You know me my lord
Only by reputation Khaleesi And Im no lord merely a humble merchant They call you the Mother of Dragons
And what should I call you
Oh my name is quite long and quite impossible for foreigners to pronounce I am simply a trader of spices But we are the Thirteen charged with the governance and protection of Qarth the greatest city that ever was or will be
The beauty of Quarth is legendary SPICE KING Qarth
Qarth
Might we see the dragons
My friend we have traveled very far We have no food no water Once I see my people fed I would be honored SPICE
Forgive me Mother of Dragons but no man alive has seen a living dragon Some of my more skeptical friends refuse to believe your children even exist All we ask is the chance to see for ourselves
I am not a liar
Oh I dont think you are But as Ive never met you before my opinion on the matter is of limited value
Where I come from guests are treated with respect not insulted at the gates
Then perhaps you should return to where you come from We wish you well
What are you doing You promised to receive me
We have received you Here we are and here you are
If you do not let us in all of us will die
Which we shall deeply regret But Qarth did not become the greatest city that ever was or will be by letting Dothraki savages through its gates
Khaleesi please be careful
Thirteen When my dragons are grown we will take back what was stolen from me and destroy those who have wronged me We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground Turn us away and we will burn you first
Ah You are a true Targaryen Only as you said a moment ago if we dont let you into the city you will all die
Retreating in fear from a little girl is unbecoming of the greatest city that ever was or will be
The discussion is over Xaro Xhoan Daxos The Thirteen have spoken
I am one of the Thirteen and I am still speaking
The girl threatens to burn our city to the ground and you would invite her in for a cup of wine She is the Mother of Dragons
Do you expect her to watch her people starve without breathing fire I believe we can allow a few Dothraki through our gates without dooming our city After all here I am a savage from the Summer Isles and Qarth still SPICE
Our decision is final
Very well I invoke soumai
I will vouch for her her people and her dragons in accordance with the law
Be it on your head
Welcome to Qarth my lady
You
Is there gold or silver in the village
Im not from the village
Where is the Brotherhood
I dont know what that is
You two Take Lord Lannisters things to his quarters
Whats this
We werent expecting you till tomorrow Lord Tywin
Evidently not Why are these prisoners not in their cells
Cells are overflowing my lord
This lot wont be here long Dont need no permanent place After we interrogate em
Are we so wellmanned that we can afford to discard able young bodies and skilled laborers
You do you have a trade
Smith my lord
What are you looking at Kneel Kneel or Ill carve your lungs out boy
Hell do no such thing This ones a girl you idiot dressed as a boy Why
Safer to travel my lord
Smart More than I can say for this lot Get these prisoners to work Bring the girl I need a new cupbearer
My lord
Your visits are too few cousin
Her Grace the Queen Regent commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle Heres your warrant
So it is Will you take a cup with me I find that mulled wine helps me sleep
I am here at Her Graces behest not to drink with you Imp
If my sister was so concerned for Pycelle I would have thought shed come herself Instead she sends you What am I to make of that
I dont care what you make of it so long as you release your prisoner immediately
And youve received these instructions directly from Cersei
As I said several times
And youve waited this long to deliver the information
When the Queen Regent gives me a command I carry it out without delay
Cersei must have great trust in you allowing you into her chamber during the hour of the wolf
The Queen Regent has a great many responsibilities She often works from dusk till dawn
She must be very glad to have you helping her from dusk till dawn
Ah Lavender oil She always loved lavender oil even as a girl
I am a knight
An anointed knight yes Tell me did Cersei have you knighted before or after she took you into her bed What Nothing to say No more warnings for me ser
You will withdraw these filthy accusations
Have you ever given any thought to what King Joffrey will have to say when he finds out youve been bedding his mother
Its not my fault
Did she take you against your will Can you not defend yourself knight
Your own father Lord Tywin when I was named the Kings squire he told me to obey her in everything
Did he tell you to fuck her too
I only meant I did as I was bid
Hated every moment of it is that what youll have me believe A high place in court a knighthood my sisters legs spreading open for you at night Oh yes it must have been terrible Wait here His Grace will want to hear this
Mercy Mercy my lord I beg you
Save it for Joffrey He loves a good grovel
My lord it was your sisters bidding the Queen Ill leave the city at once I swear
No I think not
My lord
You heard me My father told you to obey my sister Obey her Stay close to her side Keep her trust Pleasure her whenever she requires No one ever need know as long as you keep faith with me I want to know what Cersei is doing where she goes who she sees what they talk of everything And you will tell me
Yes my lord I will I swear it as you command
Oh rise rise Let us drink to our understanding Oh you dont have a cup Oh well Smile cousin My sister is a beautiful woman and its all for the good of the realm Go back and tell her that I beg her forgiveness that I want no more conflict between us and that henceforth I shall do nothing without her consent
But her demands
Oh Ill give her Pycelle
You will
Yes Ill release him in the morning Cersei can keep him as a pet if she wants but I will not have him on the Council I could swear that I had not harmed a single hair on his head but that would not strictly speaking be true Stay within one table length
Your Grace
Do your knucklebones bring you luck
Well lifes been good since you hacked them off Your Grace And its four less fingernails to clean
Fewer
Pardon
Four fewer fingernails to clean Never understood why you had to wear them
It reminds me of where I come from and where I am now It reminds me of your justice It was an honest punishment and you were good with the cleaver
You were a hero and a smuggler A good act does not wash out the bad nor a bad the good
A lesson Ive tried to teach my son
Does he listen
To me Gods no But if your red woman told him to leap from the crows nest
She has a name I trust youve not forgotten your smugglers tricks
Ive lived within the law for 17
I want you to be a smuggler this time
Any shore any night What am I bringing ashore
The red woman No one must know what you do and well not speak of this again
I am true to Your Grace and always will be but surely there are other ways cleaner ways
Cleaner ways dont win wars
Are you afraid Onion Knight
Someone once told me the night is dark and full of terrors
Youve carried more unpleasant cargo in your time Are you a good man Ser Davos Seaworth
Id say my parts are mixed my lady good and bad
If half an onion is black with rot its a rotten onion A man is good or he is evil
And which are you
Oh good Im a knight myself of sorts a champion of light and life
Well that must be very nice for you
Do you love your wife
I do
Yet you have known other women
Dont talk about my wife
Im not Im talking about other women Like me Ser Davos You want me You want to see whats beneath this robe
And you will
Strange that this Lord of Light asks you to work in the shadows
Shadows cannot live in the dark Ser Davos They are servants of light the children of fire And the brighter the flame the darker they are
These werent here before Theyve barred the passage
They cant bar our passage
Gods protect us
You swear it
By the mother My son has no interest in the Iron Throne
Then I see no reason for hostility between us Your soncan go on calling himself King in the North The Starks will have dominion over all lands north of Moat Cailin provided he swears me an oath of fealty
And the wording of this oath
The same Ned Stark swore to Robert 18 years ago Cat their friendship held the kingdoms together
And in return for my sons loyalty
In the morning Ill destroy my brothers army
When thats done Baratheon and Stark will fight their common enemy together as they have done many times before
Our two houses have always been close which is why I am begging you to reconsider this battle Negotiate a peace with your brother
Negotiate with Stannis You heard him out there Id have better luck debating the wind
Please bring my terms to your son I believe we are natural allies I hope he feels the same Together we could end this war in a fortnight
No No
Follow me
Youll die for this
No wait it wasnt her
Weve got to leave Theyll hang you for this
Inside the kings tent
Now
I wont leave him
You cant avenge him if youre dead
Over there go
Not that way
We need to go home Loras
My lord my lady
Get out
Stannis will be here in an hour When he arrives Renlys bannermen will flock to him Your former companions will fight for the privilege of selling you to their new king
And you want that privilege for yourself
You will note that I am standing here talking to you not Stannis
Theres no time for this
Ride back to Highgarden sister Im not running from Stannis
Brienne of Tarth murdered Renly
I dont believe that You dont believe that Who gained the most from our kings death
Stannis
I will put a sword through his righteous face
You cant stay here
He would have been a true king a good king
Tell me Ser Loras what do you desire most in this world
Revenge
I have always found that to be the purest of motivations but you wont have a chance to put your sword through Stannis not today Youll be cut to pieces before he sets foot on solid ground If it is justice that you want be smart about it
You cant avenge him from the grave Bring the horses Please
He was very handsome
He was Your Grace
Your Grace Calling yourself king doesnt make you one And if Renly wasnt a king I wasnt a queen
Do you want to be a queen
No I want to be the queen
Killed By whom
Accounts differ Most seem to implicate Catelyn Stark in some way
Really Whod have thought
Some say it was one of his own Kingsguard while still others say it was Stannis himself who did it after negotiations went sour
Whomever did it I say well done
Its not what Varys says He says Renlys army is flocking to support Stannis which would give Stannis superiority over us on both land and sea
Littlefinger says we can outspend him three to one
And I say Father raised you to have too much respect for money Stannis Baratheon is coming for us sooner rather than later
Arent there other things you should be doing like sealing my daughter in a crate so you can ship her away
Shell be safer in Dorne
Yes I know how concerned you are for her safety
It so happens that I am Myrcella is a sweet innocent girl and I dont blame her at all for you
So clever Arent you always so clever with your schemes and your plots
Schemes and plots are the same thing They are going to attack us We need to be ready
No need to concern yourself over it The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations
May I ask specifically what the king has in mind
You may specifically or you may ask vaguely The answer will be the same
Its important that we talk about this
Its the kings royal prerogative to withhold sensitive information from his councilors
Its wildfire
Wildfire You wouldnt lie to me would you cousin
No
Thats a lie right there
It is not a lie Why would I lie
Tell me if the vile allegations against my brother and sister are true do you think it will make Jaime more likely to kill you or less likely When I tell him youre fucking her I mean
Im telling you the truth
The smart money would be on more likely
Shes making wildfire
But then perhaps his own unnatural urges will give him sympathy for yours
The Alchemists Guild is being commissioned
I suppose theres only one way to find out
They have thousands of pots already stored in their vaults They are planning to launch it from the city walls into Stannis ships and armies Please
When did she tell you this
I heard her talking with the pyromancer And the other night after I left her she went to meet him I swear to you
Swear to me on what
On my life
But I dont care about your life
In the light of the Seven by all that is holy and right I Lancel Lannister do solemnly vow
All right all right Enough Even torturing you is boring Just get out
Oh Lancel tell my friend Bronn to please kill you if anything should happen to me
Please kill me if anything should happen to Lord Tyrion
It will be my pleasure
Your Grace
What is it
Im sorry about your brother Your Grace I wanted to let you know that people grieve for him
Fools love a fool I grieve for him as well for the boy he was not the man he grew to be
I need to speak to you about what I saw in that cave
I thought I made it clear to you thered be no need to speak to me on this matter
Your Grace I 
Ive never known you to need to hear a thing twice
And Ive never known you to hide from the truth
Youve come to lecture me on truth
Ive come to tell you that what I saw
All my brothers bannermen have come to my side Except the Tyrells who fled like cowards They wont be able to resist us now Soon I shall be sitting on the Iron Throne
Nothing is worth what this will cost you not even the Iron
Ill hear no more about it
Take a company of men secure the perimeter
When do we sail for Kings Landing
As soon as Ive consolidated my troops Well make short work of the Lannisters fleet Once Blackwater Bay is cleared well deliver our troops to their doorstep and take the city
And will you bring Lady Melisandre with you
Thats not your concern
If you take Kings Landing with her by your side the victory will be hers
I never thought Id have reason to doubt your loyalty Was I wrong
Loyal service means telling hard truths
Oh truth again All right whats the truth The hard truth
Shes a foreigner preaching her foreign religion Some believe she whispers orders in your ear and you obey
What do you believe
You won those bannermen from Renly Dont lose them to her
We set out for Kings Landing without Lady Melisandre And you lead the fleet into Blackwater Bay
Your Grace Im honored but my time on the sea was spent evading ships not attacking them The other lords wont be happy
Most of those lords should consider themselves lucky I dont hang them for treason Hard truths cut both ways Ser Davos
Ive got it Ive got it
So its that one there at the top on the right
Buy my fruit my lord Fresh fruit
Stannis has more infantry more ships more horses What do we have
Theres that mind of yours you keep going on about
Well Ive never actually been able to kill people with it
Good thing Id be out of a job What about your father
He hasnt sent a raven in weeks Hes very busy Being repeatedly humiliated by Robb Stark is timeconsuming We wont be able to hold the city against Stannis not the way Joffreys planning on holding it
Corruption
Yes
We are swollen bloated foul Brother fornicates with sister in the bed of kings and were surprised when the fruit of their incest is rotten Yes a rotten king
Its hard to argue with his assessment
Not after what he did to your birthday present
The king is a lost cause Its the rest of us Im worried about now
A dancing king prancing down his bloodstained halls to the tune of a twisted demon monkey
You have to admire his imagination
Hes talking about you
What Demon monkey
People think youre pulling the kings strings They blame you for the citys ills
Blame me Im trying to save them
You dont need to convince me
Demon monkey
Yeah come on
Youre the crew of the Sea Bitch Im your commander Welcome
Stop Stop Your captain commands you to stop
Where are we headed Captain
The Stony Shore to raid their villages Therell be spoils in it for you and women if you do your jobs well
And who decides if weve done our jobs well
I do Your captain
I have been reaving and raping since before you left Balons balls Captain Dont reckon Ive got much use for your ideas on how to do it Dont reckon Ive got much use for a captain at all Im thinking I can do the job of captain real well myself All I need is a ship You wouldnt know where I could find myself a ship now would you
You could do that take the ship head out on your own And I will hunt you down drag you back here in chains and hang you for a traitor
Stop We yield
Congratulations on your first command
Thank you Kind of you to come see me off
Oh Im not here for you I was just on my way to Red Harbor Ive got 30 ships Theres nowhere to put them here Too narrow
Youd better get out there Wouldnt want her to set sail without you
That would never happen My crew would wait on deck for a year if I asked them to This lot though Enjoy the Stony Shore
Come on Ill take you out
Who are you
Dagmer your first mate
Why arent you with the rest of them Or did they send you to row me out and dump me halfway in the sea That would be good for a laugh
Theyre not gonna respect you until you prove yourself
And how am I supposed to prove myself by pillaging pisspoor fishing villages
Youre not
And yet thats the task my father has given me to prove that Im a true Iron Islander
Theyre all Iron Islanders Do they do as theyre told or do they do as they like
The Stony Shores not far from Torrhens Square
The seat of the House of Tallhart a more impressive prize than a few fishermens daughters What you dont think we could take it
No we could We could never hold it for more than a few days As soon as Winterfell got word that wed taken Torrhens Square the Starks would send their men to take it back
Take me to my ship
The Starks have overextended their lines Now that summers over theyll have a hard time keeping their men and horses fed
The Starks understand winter better than we ever will The cold wont beat them
Our spies report growing discontent among the Northern lords They want to return home and gather the harvest before the crops turn
And Im sure if those same spies snuck into our own encampments they would report growing discontent amongst the Southern lords This is war no ones content Weve underestimated the Stark boy for too long He has a good mind for warfare his men worship him And as long as he keeps winning battles theyll keep believing he is King in the North Youve been waiting for him to fail He is not going to fail not without our help So how do we stop him
Weve worked through the night my lord Perhaps wed profit from some sleep
Yes I think you would Reginald And because youre my cousin I might even let you wake from that sleep Go Im sure your wife must miss you
My wifes in Lannisport
Well then youd better start riding Go before I change my mind and send her your head
If your name wasnt Lannister youd be scrubbing out pots in the cooks tent Go
Not wine water Well be here for some time Girl where are you from
Maidenpool my lord
And who are the Lords of Maidenpool Remind me
House Mooton my lord
And what is their sigil
A red salmon I think a Maidenpool girl would remember that Youre a Northerner arent you
Good One more time where are you from
Barrowton my lord House Dustin Two crossed longaxes beneath a black crown
And what do they say of Robb Stark in the North
They call him the Young Wolf
And
They say he rides into battle on the back of a giant direwolf They say he can turn into a wolf himself when he wants They say he cant be killed
And do you believe them
No my lord Anyone can be killed
Fetch that water
A girl says nothing
A girl keeps her mouth closed No one hears and friends may talk in secret yes A boy becomes a girl
I was always a girl
And I was always aware But the girl keeps secrets It is not for a man to spoil them
Youre one of them now I should have let you burn
And you fetch water for one of them now Why is this right for you and wrong for me
I didnt have a choice
You did I did And here we are
A man pays his debts A man owes three
Three what
The Red God takes what is his lovely girl And only death may pay for life You saved me and the two I was with You stole three deaths from the Red God We have to give them back Speak three names and the man will do the rest Three lives I will give you no more no less and were done
I can name anyone and youll kill him
A man has said
The one who tortures everyone
A man needs a name
I dont know his name They call him the Tickler
That is enough Go now girl Your master is thirsty
Hes not here yet Hed have seen us blown the horn
When will he come
The Halfhand does things in his own time
My uncle told me stories about him
Most of them are true
I heard the Halfhand spent half of last winter beyond the Wall
The whole winter He was north of the Skirling Pass when the snows came Had to wait for the thaw
So it is possible for someone to survive out here on their own
Well possible for the Halfhand
Beautiful isnt it Gilly would love it here
Theres nothing more sickening than a man in love
About time you did something At least youll keep warm
The Fist of the First Men Think of how old this place is Before the Targaryens defeated the Andals before the Andals took Westeros from the First Men
Before I die please stop talking
Thousands and thousands of years ago the First Men stood here where were standing all through the long night What do you think they were like the First Men
Stupid Smart people dont find themselves in places like this
I think they were afraid I think they came here to get away from something And I dont think it worked
Wildlings
One blast is for rangers returning Wildlings is two blasts
So you got to stand there waiting wondering One blast for friends two for foes
And three for White Walkers Its been a thousand years but thats the only time they blow the horn three times
But if its been a thousand years how do you know
Well I read it in a book
I read it in a book
Look Its Qhorin Halfhand
Aye well live another day Hurrah
Take care my lord
I remember reading an old sailors proverb Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off
Oh I have not conducted this experiment It could well be true The substance burns so hot it melts wood stone even steel and of course flesh The substance burns so hot it melts flesh like tallow
After the dragons died wildfire was the key to the Targaryen power
My companion takes issue
If I could tell you how many crazy old men Ive seen pushing carts around army camps making grand claims about jars full of pig shit No offense meant
Our order does not deal in pig shit The substance is fire given form And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor
To do what
The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy
How much do you have
If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults then maybe youd hit your target one time in ten but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father
My lord this man is insulting
I dont know if youve ever seen a battle old man but things can get a bit messy Cause when were flinging things at Stannis hes flinging them right back at us Men die men shit themselves men run which means pots falling which means fire inside the walls which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down
My friend remains unconvinced
He would not dare insult my order whilst Aerys Targaryen lived
Well hes not living anymore And all his pots of wildfire didnt help him did they Men win wars not magic tricks
We have been working tirelessly day and night ever since your royal sister commanded us to do so Our present count stands at 7811 Enough to burn Stannis Baratheons fleet and armies both
This is a shit idea
Im afraid I have to concur with my advisor Wisdom Haylene The contents of this room could lay Kings Landing low You wont be making wildfire for my sister any longer Youll be making it for me
Dracarys Dracarys
Hell be able to feed himself from now on
Let him sleep Doreah
Yes Khaleesi
He loves you
I rewove this part of the top And I fixed the heel on this one
Thank you my friend
Did you see the dress Xaro had made for you They say hes the wealthiest man in Qarth
It is known
And if Qarth is the wealthiest city in Essos
The last time a rich man gave me a dress he was selling me to Khal Drogo
May he ride forever through the night lands
Xaro is our host but we know nothing about him Men like to talk about other men when theyre happy
You would look like a real princess in Xaros
Shes not a princess Shes a Khaleesi You should wear it Khaleesi
You are their guest It would be rude not to
And you must visit the night market The Qartheen night market is like no night market youve ever seen
It sounds wonderful
The Meereenis think they have a night market I will take you there myself
Please excuse me for a moment
What are they doing
Malakko says the statue is too heavy to carry Kovarro says that Malakko is an idiot They can pry out the gems the rest is pure gold Very soft He can chop off as much as we can carry
Or melt it Very simple
We are his guests You cant pry it or chop it or melt it
Of course not Khaleesi We will wait until we leave
Not even when we leave
Why not
Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him I will hear no more
My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki knew how to do was steal things better men have built
Its not the only thing Theyre quite good at killing the better men
Thats not the kind of queen Im going to be
Mother of Dragons On behalf of the warlocks of Qarth I welcome you A demonstration
Take this gem Look at it Into its depths So many facets Look closely enough and you can see yourself in them Often more than once
Should you grow tired of Xaros baubles and trinkets it would be an honor to host you at the House of the Undying You are always welcome Mother of Dragons
My apologies Pyatt Pree is one of the Thirteen It was customary for me to extend him an invitation Customs die slow deaths in Qarth
What is the House of the Undying
It is where the warlocks go to squint at dusty books and drink shade of the evening It turns their lips blue and their minds soft So soft they actually believe their parlor tricks are magic
You watch over her
Do I know you
I know you Jorah Mormont of Bear Island
Who are you
Im no one But she is the Mother of Dragons She needs true protectors now more than ever They shall come day and night to see the wonder born into the world again And when they see they shall lust for dragons are fire made flesh And fire is power
It looked like Stannis
To me it just looked like A shadow in the shape of a man
In the shape of Stannis
We should reach my sons camp tomorrow
Will you stay there long my lady
Only long enough to tell Robb what I have seen After that I will leave for Winterfell My two youngest need me Ive been away from them for far too long
I never knew my mother
Im sorry
My own mother died on the birthing bed when I was very young
Its a bloody business
What comes after is even harder
Once youre safely back amongst your own people will you give me leave to go my lady
You mean to kill Stannis
I swore a vow
But Stannis has a great army around him His own guards are sworn to keep him safe
Im as good as any of them I should never have fled
Renlys death was no fault of yours You served him bravely
I only held him that once as he was dying
Hes gone Brienne You serve nothing and no one by following him into the earth Renlys enemies are Robbs enemies as well
I do not know your son my lady But I could serve you if you would have me You have courage Not battle courage perhaps but I dont know a womans kind of courage And I think that when the time comes you will not hold me back Promise me that you will not hold me back from Stannis
When the time comes I will not hold you back
Then I am yours my lady I will shield your back and give my life for yours if it comes to that I swear it by the Old Gods and the new
I vow that you shall always have a place in my home and at my table and that I shall ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the Old Gods and the new
And its not just thieves my lord Theres wolves in them hills now more than I ever seen They come down in the night and they kill my sheep My three sons is away fighting for your brother my lord Theyll fight keep fighting till theyre told to go home I have no one to man my flock now Only me I cant keep watch all day and all night
We can send two orphan boys from Winterstown home with you to help watch over your flock if you can give them room and board
My wife always prayed for more children Well look after them Thank you my lord And may the gods bless you and yours
Stop it If thats everyone Im going to go for a ride before dark
Good
Hodor
Hodor
Bran Lord Stark Torrhens Square is under siege
Torrhens Square is barely 40 leagues from here How can the Lannisters strike so far north
Might be a raiding party led by the mountain Might be sellswords paid by Tywin Lannister
We have to help them
Most of the fighting men are away with Robb but I can gather 200 decent men
Do you need so many
If we cant protect our own bannermen why should they protect us Go Ser Rodrik Take the men you need
Wont take long my lord Southerners dont do well up here
So what does it mean
Ask your Maester Luwin Hes the one studying books all the time
I did ask him Hed never heard of a threeeyed raven
Must not mean anything then
Youre lying
You might be a little lord but dont you call me a liar
You know what it means
I never said I didnt
You didnt give me an honest answer
Thats not the same as being a liar
Well its not far off
So youve been dreaming of a threeeyed raven again In the godswood you told me you didnt dream Now whos a liar What did you see in your dream
Something bad Tell me boy
I dreamt that the sea came to Winterfell I saw waves crashing against the gates and the water came flowing over the walls It flooded the castle Drowned men were floating here in the yard Ser Rodrik was one of them
The sea is hundreds of miles away
I know Its just a stupid dream
Ive got to get these potatoes to the kitchen Otherwise theyll put me in chains again
Osha The threeeyed raven what do they say about it north of the Wall
They say all sorts of crazy things north of the Wall
There
Where
On that mountain
I dont see very well
A fire
Theres a fire The people sitting around it have better eyes than yours or mine When they see us coming that fire becomes a signal Gives Mance Rayder plenty of time to throw a party in our honor
How many wildlings have joined him
From what we can tell all of them Mance has gathered them all like deer against the wolves Theyre almost ready to make their move
Where
Somewhere safe Somewhere south Cant just march into their midst And we cant wait for them here with nothing but a pile of stones to protect us
You saying we should fall back to the Wall
Mance was one of us once Now hes one of them Hes going to teach them our way of doing things Theyll hit us in force and they wont run away when we hit back Theyre gonna be more organized than before more disciplined more like us So we need to be more like them do things their way Sneak in kill Mance and scatter them to the winds before they can march on the Wall And to do that
We need to get rid of those lookouts
Its not a job for 400 men I need to move fast and silent Harker Stonesnake Borba
Lord Commander Id like to join Lord Qhorin
Ive been called lots of things but that might be my first Lord Qhorin Youre a steward Snow not a ranger
Ive fought and killed a wight How many rangers can say that
Hes the one
Aye You killed a wight You also let an old man beat you bloody and take your sword
Craster In the boys defense thats a tough old goat
I could take up Jons duties while hes gone my lord It would be no trouble
Well I hope you make a better ranger than you do a steward Go on
So tell me how long has your manservant been in love with you
Hes not my manservant and hes not in love with me Hes my advisor and hes my friend
Unlikely I can almost always tell what a man wants
And what about what a woman wants
Much more complicated You for example what do you want
To cross the Narrow Sea and take back the Iron Throne
Why
Because I promised my khalasar Id protect them and find them a safe home
You want to conquer the Seven Kingdoms for the Dothraki
I want them because theyre mine by right The Iron Throne is mine and I will take it
Ah a conqueror
And how did you get all of this Did someone give it to you
No I come from nothing I hit the docks like a piece of cargo except someone normally cares what happens to cargo
So you wanted more than you had and you took it Youre a conqueror too Youre just less ambitious
What do you want Xaro Xhoan Daxos At the gates of the city you bled for me Why
I will show you why
The door and the vault is made of Valyrian stone The hardest steel does not make a mark I offered the greatest locksmiths in Qarth their weight in gold if they could break into it I made the same offer to the greatest thieves They all went home emptyhanded The only thing that can open this door is this key
And behind the door
And it can all be mine
All Let us say half More than enough to buy horses ships armies Enough to go home
All I have to do
Is marry me
That was a romantic proposal
Ive already married once for love but the gods stole her from me I come from nothing My mother and father never owned a pair of shoes But marry me and I will give you the Seven Kingdoms and our children will be princes and princesses
See I have more ambition than you thought The time is right Daenerys Targaryen First of Your Name Robert Baratheon is dead
If you cross the sea with an army you bought and a foreign husband who paid for it
The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another Four false kings destroying the country
To win Westeros you need support from Westeros
The usurper is dead
The Starks fight the Lannisters and Baratheons fight each other
According to your new friend who earned your trust by cutting his hand
The time to strike is now We need to find ships and an army or well spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world
Rich men do not become rich by giving more than they get Theyll give you ships and soldiers and theyll own you forever Moving carefully is the hard way but its the right way
And if Id listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth wed all be dead by now
I know the opportunity before you seems like the last youll ever have
Do not speak to me like Im a child
I only want
What do you want Tell me
To see you on the Iron Throne
Why
You have a good claim A title A birthright But you have something more than that You may cover it up and deny it but you have a gentle heart You would not only be respected and feared you would be loved Someone who can rule and should rule Centuries come and go without a person like that coming into the world There are times when I look at you and I still cant believe youre real
So what would you have me do as my advisor
Make your own way Find your own ship You only need one The allies we need are in Westeros not Qarth
And how do I get the ship
Ill find it for you A sound ship with a good captain
I look forward to meeting him
Khaleesi
You should stand sideface
Sideface
Sideways
Why
Smaller target
Am I fighting someone
Youre practicing for a fight You should practice right
Guards Did you see anything Go up there Go and see where he fell from
Go up the battlement
That is strange
Ive taken your castle
Theon
Its Prince Theon now Get up You have to get dressed Ive taken Winterfell I took it Im occupying it I sent men over the walls with grappling claws and ropes
Why
To take the castle
You went with Robb
And he sent me back to Pyke Im a Greyjoy I cant fight for Robb and my father both Wheres Hodor
I dont know
Find the halfwit
My men are bringing your people together in the courtyard
Why
So you and I can go down and tell them how youve yielded Winterfell to me
I wont
Yes you will
I wont Ill never yield Well fight you and throw you out
The castle is mine But these people are still yours Youll yield to keep them safe to keep them alive Thats what a good lord would do Think carefully about what you want to say
Theon Did you hate us the whole time
Ive yielded Winterfell to Theon
Louder Say Prince Theon
Ive yielded Winterfell to Prince Theon You all know me
Aye we know you for a steaming sack of shit
Farlen you be silent
Listen to your little lord Farlen He has more sense than you do
All of you should do as he commands
My father has donned the ancient crown of Salt and Rock and declared himself King of the Iron Islands He claims the North as well by right of conquest You are all his subjects
Bugger that I serve the Starks If you think you can hold the North with it
Shut up
If you serve me as loyally as you served Ned Stark I will be as good to you as he ever was Betray me and you will wish you hadnt Maester Luwin send a raven to Pyke informing my father of my victory here And one to Deepwood Motte to my sister Inform her that shes to bring You are a maester of the Citadel sworn to serve the Lord of Winterfell are you not
I am
I am the Lord of Winterfell as Bran just informed you Send the ravens
My lord
My Lord Greyjoy
I see youve finally learned how to address your betters What do you want I was brought here a captive
You were here the day I was taken
Im the one who took you What of it
Let me serve you
Serve me how I need fighters not kitchen sluts
It was Robb Stark who put me in the kitchens Put a spear in my hand again
So you can bury it in my neck Do you take me for a fool Get up
Step aside
Why
Its your dream little lord The ocean has come to swallow this place I aint letting it drown me
Youll all go about your tasks as usual And in a few days time BLACK
Greyjoy
We caught this one on his way back from Torrhens Square Took out two of ours before I got his sword
Ser Rodrik it grieves me that we meet as foes
It grieves me youve less honor than a back alley whore You were raised here under this roof These people are your people
They are not my people
King Robb thought of you as a brother
My brothers are dead They died fighting Stark men men like you
Aye they died fighting a war your father started Lord Stark raised you among his own sons
Among them but not one of them I was his hostage taken from my home
If he were alive to see this
Hes not Hes dead The Seven Kingdoms are at war And Winterfell is mine
I should have put a sword in your belly instead of in your hand
Youve served this house faithfully old man But keep talking and Ill
Take him to the cells
My prince You cannot let that stand He must pay
Ill lock him in a cell until he rots
No he has to pay the iron price Theyll never respect you while he lives
Ser Rodrik I sentence you to death
No You said no harm would come to them if I yielded
The old man couldnt keep his mouth shut
I urge you not to make a hasty decision
He disrespected me in front of my men That was his decision not mine
He is worth more to you alive than dead The Starks will pay Please Theon think what you do
Youll address me as Prince Theon or youll be next
Come
No No Theon Please Ser Rodrik
He who passes the sentence should swing the sword
Im begging you
Coward
Stop Stop Stop right now
You dont give commands anymore little lord
Please stop this Please stop him
Hush now child Im off to see your father
You said no harm would come You said no harm would come Theon please
Any last words old man
Gods help you Theon Greyjoy Now you are truly lost
Theon please dont
Do something
Ill do anything please No please stop it
Ghost stay with us Ghost
There goes your pet
Hes not a pet
No youre right hes not You cant tame a wild thing You cant trust a wild thing
Ghost is different
So you think Wild creatures have their own rules their own reasons And youll never know them Now the wildlings were looking for sleep during the day and hunt at night
I thought you said you couldnt know wild things
I said you cant They find a nice cave to hide in while the suns up and do their killing when its dark
We could do the same
No we couldnt This is their country They know where to walk where not to walk Ive lost good men who fell into a crevasse they didnt see till they were in it
My father always said Im of the North
I wasnt joking
Look around boy This look like home to you You start thinking you know this place it will kill you You understand me
No you dont Were at war Weve always been at war Its never going to end cause were not fighting an enemy Were fighting the North and its not going anywhere The Watch has given you a great gift You only have one thing to give in return your life
Ill gladly give my life
I dont want you to be glad about it I want you to curse and fight until your hearts done pumping And know this boy Your death will be a gift for them south of the Wall Theyll never know what youve done Theyll never know how you died They wont even know your damn name But theyll be alive because some nameless bastard north of the Wall gave his life for theirs Now do you understand me
I do
Youre even dumber than you look Its just words boy to keep us a little warmer in the night Make us feel like weve got a purpose Come on Weve got to find these goat fuckers before night falls and they find us
Can you read
My lord
Can you read
This letter detailing our infantry movements was meant for Lord Damon of House Marbrand It was sent to Lord Marlyn of House Dormand
My apologies my lord
Girl fetch me the History of the Greater and the Lesser Houses Its the one on this
My cupbearer can read better than you
To whom does House Dormand owe allegiance
My lord
To the Starks of Winterfell Who have 20000 men and my son I judged you might be good for something more than brutalizing peasants I see I overestimated you If you ever put my sons life at risk again Ill Leave us
Put the book away girl Maybe you should devise our next battle plan while youre about it
Lord Petyr Baelish
Mmm Give us the room
Clear all this
Lord Tywin
Baelish
Wine
Thank you
What news from the capital
I traveled here directly from Renly Baratheons camp
Ah the late King Renly Rather a short reign Murdered by a woman I hear
So they say There has been talk of other forces at work Dark forces
Here Men love to blame demons when their grand plans unravel
It is my belief that a moment of chaos affords opportunities lost soon after
You say that as if you were the first man alive to think it Yes a crisis is an opportunity What other brilliant insights have you brought me today
After the Lannisters and the Starks the Tyrells command the largest host Their lands are the most fertile in the Seven Kingdoms feeding horses and soldiers
Yes yes yes
The Tyrells have not yet declared for any of the surviving kings Loras wants revenge He blames Stannis for Renlys death
Wants to be queen
Yes she does
House Tyrell rebelled against the Iron Throne Against my grandson
They did And perhaps that treason should be punished one day after Stannis and Robb Stark are defeated
More wine for Lord Baelish
If you will allow me to represent your familys interests I believe that an advantageous agreement
The Tyrell host has returned to Highgarden
They have
Pardon my lord
Its only wine
You would ride there yourself
Tonight with your leave
Ill have an answer by nightfall Thatll be all girl
And what else
On your son Tyrions directive I met with Catelyn Stark
Why
He had an interesting proposal for her concerning her daughters
Hmm
A girl
A wildling
We could question her
You could She wont answer Ive known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking
Whats your name
Ygritte
She was reaching for this ax when you got to her Give her half a chance shell bury it in your face
I gave you my name
Im Jon Snow
You ought to burn them you killed
Wed need a big fire for that Tell me Ygritte Why do you want us to build a big fire Are there some more friends in the area
Burn them or maybe youll need those swords again
Our boy heres already killed one dead man He can do it again if he has to What waits beyond the pass
The free folk
How many
Hundreds and thousands More than youve ever seen crow
Why come to the mountains Whats in the Frostfangs your king could want
Do you mean to march on the Wall
Do you know who I am girl
Qhorin Halfhand
Tell me true If your people captured me would they take me prisoner
Theyd take your head off your shoulders if they was feeling kind If not theyd kill you slow
We have no food for her Cant spare a man to watch her Cant let her go Shell bring Mance Rayders army down on us It needs to be done Want me to do it
No No Ill do it
Come brothers Well leave him to it Well meet you at the top Dont take too long Were deep in their country now
You never killed a woman before did you You dont need to do it Mance would take you I know he would Theres secret ways The crows would never catch us
Im as much a crow as they are
Will you burn me After
Cant Someone might see the smoke
Strike hard and true Jon Snow or Ill come back and haunt you Thats cold Go on Be quick about it
Do it Bastard do it
You cant do it We both know it
The suns going down Jon Snow And your friends are nowhere close
Ill find them
Call for them Go on Call loudly A shoreline at Kings Landing In a skiff crowded with people MYRCELLA sit down looking back at the shore Th blesses her travels
May the Seven guide the princess on her journey May the Mother give her health May the crone give her wisdom May the warrior give her courage
One day I pray you love someone I pray you love her so much when you close your eyes you see her face I want that for you I want you to know what its like to love someone to truly love someone Before I take her from you
You sound like a little cat mewling for his mother Princes dont cry
I saw you cry
Did you say something my lady
My little brother cried when I left Winterfell
So
It seems a normal thing
Is your little brother a prince
No
Not really relevant then is it Come dog
Hail Joffrey Hail to the King Seven blessings on you Your Grace
Murderer Bastard
All hail the King
Hes no king
Hes a bastard
Please Your Grace were hungry
Freak
Get the Prince back to the Keep now
Yes my lord Come quickly
Please Your Grace give us some food
Bread Your Grace please
Who threw that I want the man who threw that Find who did that and bring him to me
Hold on

Come in Come in
Keep him safe
Motherfucker Brotherfucker
Watch out Hold them back
Come on
Hey
Traitors Ill have all their heads
You blind bloody fool
You cant insult me
Weve had vicious kings and weve had idiot kings but I dont know if weve ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king
You cant
I can I am
They attacked me
They threw a cow pie at you so you decided to kill them all Theyre starving you fool All because of a war you started
Youre talking to a king
And now Ive struck a king Did my hand fall from my wrist Where is the Stark girl
Let them have her
If she dies youll never get your Uncle Jaime back You owe him quite a bit you know
Where are you going
You ever been fucked little girl Come here
Take some men and go and find the Stark girl
I take my orders from the king
Where This way
Please No No
Please
Youre all right now little bird Youre all right
Well get you
Well get you
This way
Are you hurt my lady
The little birds bleeding Someone take her back to her cage See to that cut
Well done Clegane
I didnt do it for you
He shouldnt make me wait
The Spice King is the second wealthiest man in Qarth He makes everyone wait Of course you could have avoided this embarrassment if you married the wealthiest man in Qarth
I already have a husband
Khal Drogo is gone Khaleesi You are far too young to be a widow forever and far too beautiful
And you are far too smart to think that I will succumb to flattery
I have traveled very far in my life and met many women but none that are immune to flattery
The Mother of Dragons
Ah here he comes
Forgive me I had terrible dreams last night Terrible dreams I could not sleep until the sun was shining and the birds were singing Look what a beauty you are now the Red Waste has been washed off you I am sorry about all that unpleasantness The silver hair of a true Targaryen Xaro Xhoan Daxos she is far too lovely for a glorified dockworker like yourself
Very true and yet they say that your grandfather who sold pepper off the back of a wagon married a lady far lovelier and higher born than himself
Every lady alive was lovelier and higher born than my grandfather Did my servants not offer you something to eat to drink Ill have them flogged in the square
Thank you my lord You are a gracious host but there is no servant alive that can bring me what I want
Oh she has a talent for drama this one So my little princess what is it you want
My birthright The Seven Kingdoms of Westeros
I fear Im no better than a servant in this regard I cannot give you what I do not have
Im not asking you for the kingdoms Im asking you for ships
I need to cross the Narrow Sea I need my ships as well I use them you see to bring spices from one port to another
Whatever you grant me now will be repaid three times over when I retake the Iron Throne
Retake Did you once sit on the Iron Throne
My father sat there before he was murdered
But if you did not sit on it yourself would it not be correct to say take the Iron Throne 
I didnt come here to argue grammar
Of course not You came to take my ships So let me explain my position little princess Unlike you I do not have exalted ancestors I make my living by trade And I judge every trade on its merits You ask for ships You say I shall be repaid triple I do not doubt your honesty or your intentions But before you repay your debts you must seize the Seven Kingdoms Do you have an army
Not yet
You do not have an army Do you have powerful allies in Westeros
There are many there that support my claim
When were you there last
I left when I was a baby
So in truth you have no allies
The people will rise to fight for their rightful queen when I return
Ah Forgive me little princess but I cannot make an investment based on wishes and dreams Now if youll pardon me
Do you know lllyrio Mopatis Magister of Pentos Yes weve met
A shrewd man
For my wedding he gave me three petrified dragon eggs He believed The world believed that the ages had turned them to stone How many centuries has it been since dragons roamed the skies But I dreamt that if I carried those eggs into a great fire they would hatch When I stepped into the fire my own people thought I was mad But when the fire burned out I was unhurt the Mother of Dragons
Do you understand Im no ordinary woman My dreams come true
I admire your passion But in business I trust in logic not passion Im sorry little princess
I am not your little princess I am Daenerys Stormborn of the blood of Old Valyria and I will take what is mine With fire and blood I will take it
Yes my lady but not with my ships  catching her in the act
Who taught you to read
My father my lord
Hmm I taught my son Jaime to read The maester came to me one day told me he wasnt learning He couldnt make sense of the letters He reversed them in his head The maester said hed heard tell of this affliction and that we simply must accept it Ha After that I sat Jaime down for four hours every day until he learned He hated me for it for a time For a long time But he learned Hmm Where is your father Is he alive Who was he
A stonemason
A stonemason who could read Hmm
He taught himself
Quite a man What killed him
Loyalty
Youre a sharp little thing arent you
Did Forgive me my lord I shouldnt ask questions
No But youve already begun
Did you know your father my lord
I did I grew up with him I watched him grow old
He loved us He was a good man but a weak man A weak man who nearly destroyed our house and name Im cold
Ill fetch more wood for the fire my lord
Mmm
Where are you going girl
The armory my lord
Why
Lord Tywin sent me
What might this be
Lord Tywin gave it to me
What for
To take to the armory
Why would he do that Lets go and ask him
Move Get out of the way
Amory Lorch
A girl has named a second name A man will do what must be done
Now
A girl cannot tell a man when exactly he must do a thing A man cannot make a thing happen before its time
But hes going to tell Tywin Hes getting away It has to be now
Guard
Your Grace
Your Grace
My honor Your Grace

Your Grace
Quent
Lady Talisa
Your Grace
Im not sure Im a lady
Westerosi customs are still a bit foreign to me
Its hard to keep all the rules straight But if I remember my lessons a woman of noble birth is always called a lady Unless shes a queen or a princess I could find someone who knows
Why are you so sure Im of noble birth
Because its obvious
What if I told you my father sold lace on the Long Bridge and my mother my brother and I lived with him above our shop
Id call you a liar
Not very noble to accuse a lady of dishonesty
I always thought I was a brilliant liar
Better at amputations Im afraid
Quite a pretty spot
Will we be here long
I couldnt really discuss troop movements with you
Im not a spy
Of course a spy would deny being a spy
Youre right Youve found me out Im writing a letter to the Lannisters The young wolf is on the move Perhaps youd join me If youve got time of course for
Robb
Mother Mother this is Lady Talisa Shes been helping with the wounded Shes been very helpful
Lady Talisa
Lady Stark
Lady Talisa
Maegyr
Maegyr Forgive me I do not know this name
An uncommon name here An old name in Volantis Excuse me my lady Your Grace
Ive missed you
Yes you look positively forlorn
You surprised me thats all I didnt think Id see you today
I wish that you were free to follow your heart
I know
You have inherited your fathers responsibilities Im afraid they come at a cost You are promised to another
I know
A debt that must be paid
I havent forgotten
Your Grace My lady News from Winterfell
Your brothers desert you I can tell you which way to go
Well stop here Too dark to go any farther today
Here Theres no shelter here
Theres no shelter anywhere
There is if you know where to look The cold could kill us both If you light a fire
No fire
But a fire is
No fire
Have it your way
Well stay warmer if we stay close
Bet you freeze to death before I do Bet your life
Think theyre out looking for you
Yes
Think theyll find you
Yes
Youre brave Stupid but brave
We start again at first light Get some sleep
Stop moving
Im just trying to get comfortable
Stop it
Youre still moving
Was I I didnt notice that time
This cannot be true
Weve had ravens from White Harbor Barrowton and the Dreadfort Im afraid it is true
Why
Because the Greyjoys are treasonous whores
My brothers
Weve heard nothing of them But Rodrik Cassel is dead
I told you never trust a Greyjoy
I must go north at once
Theres still a war to win Your Grace
How can I call myself king if I cant hold my own castle How can I ask men to follow me if I cant
You are a king And that means you dont have to do everything yourself
Let me go and talk to Theon
There will be no talk He will die for this
Theon holds the castle with a skeleton crew Let me send word to my bastard at the Dreadfort He can raise a few hundred men and retake Winterfell before the new moon We have the Lannisters on the run If you march all the way back north now youll lose what you gained My boy would be honored to bring you Prince Theons head
Tell your son Bran and Rickons safety is paramount And Theon I want him brought to me alive I want to look him in the eye and ask him why And then Ill take his head myself
Why on earth would I trust the word of a lying little savage like you
Im no liar
All wildlings are liars and savages with no loyalty to anything or anyone
I done what I had to do to stay alive I hate the Starks as well as you do Let me serve you my lord
How And dont tell me to put a spear in your hand
There are other ways to serve my lord
Im a prince now and youd do well
There are other ways to serve my prince
Like what
We know things the free people
You know things Like what How to eat dirt
Other things
Savage things
Wait outside
I always wondered what you had under there
It comes at a price
Im not killing you Thats your price
I already had that
What do you want then other than your miserable life
What all free people want My freedom
Well you shall have it then But only if you serve me well
Ow
Shh Its not deep
I thought they were going to kill me
They thought so too
He hated me the man who hit me I saw it in his eyes Hated me He never met me before but he wanted to hurt me
Of course he did
Why Why would a stranger
You are everything he will never have Your horse eats better than his children It doesnt matter now Hes dead
I would have given them bread if I had it I hate the king more than any of them
Dont say these things If the wrong people hear you
But youre not the wrong people
Dont trust anybody Life is safer that way
And where are you going
I have something for you from Prince Theon
What
Me He says Im to make the rounds And keep you warm
The Spice King refuses me because Im a bad investment The Silk King wont support me because of his business with the Lannisters Why offend his best customer And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night Does he think I will whore myself for a boat
When I came to this city I had nothing Truly nothing I slept by the docks And when I could find work loading the ships I would eat If not I dreamed of food Today I am the richest man in Qarth Do you think the path from poverty to wealth is always pure and honorable I have done many things Khaleesi that a righteous man would condemn And here I am with no regrets
Bar the gates Ring the bells Slowly Khaleesi
W h e r e a r e t h e y  W h e r e a r e m y d r a g o n s 
A cripple You let a cripple escape The boy cant walk but somehow he slipped past you
The giant must have took him
The giant Hodor Oh thats all right then You let a halfwit escape with a cripple And Rickon too The little one
Gone along with the wildling woman The one you were fucking
Right Get the horses and the hounds
Come on find the scent Where they going
Halt
Enjoying your first hunt
So far hunting seems very similar to riding my lord
With hunting theres blood at the end
Theyre little boys
I was a little boy when I was torn away from my home and brought here So I kept my word I never ran away If I find them soon enough I wont hurt them Well Ill hurt them but I wont kill them
Those boys are of far more value to you alive than dead
They have no value to me missing
Robb will have sent a force to retake Winterfell by now
Robbs in the Riverlands My sisters in Deepwood Motte Shell get here long before they do And Ned Stark always said 500 men could hold Winterfell again 10000
We have a scent
The hounds have the scent Come Maester dont look so grim Its all just a game
We should have took more food
We couldnt risk going to the kitchens
Those people all love you They would have given you whatever you needed
And if Theon found out hed hang them
The boy cant survive on walnuts
Im fine
Weve been walking since before sunrise Eve will tire
Hodor
Even you sweet giant
Hodor
Wait I know that farm I sent those two Winterfell orphans there
Jack and Billy Theyll give us some food
We cant risk it If Theon tracks us here hell torture them until he finds out where we are
Billy climbs a tree better than anyone
Youve never seen me climb a tree little man
Theyll be after us with hounds
We got a good start on them but we cant outrun hounds forever
Did you pull a knife on me in the night
Whats the matter Cant be the first time you pressed your bone against a womans arse
Lets move
It is the first time How old are you boy
Im a man of the Nights Watch
Youre a boy whos never been with a girl Dont your stones start to hurt if your bone never gets
Dont call them that
What stones Or bone
Neither Both
Move
I heard they get all swollen and bruised if you dont use them Of course maybe thats just what the lads say when they want me feeling sorry for them As if Id feel sorry for them Are there no girl crows
There are no women of the Nights Watch no
So the lads just do it with each other
No
Never
Never We swore an oath
You have sheep at the Wall With your hands then No wonder youre all so miserable
Would you please shut up
Would you please shut up You think youre better than me crow Im a free woman
Youre a free woman I might be your prisoner but Im a free woman
If youre my prisoner youre not a free woman Thats what prisoner means
And you think youre free You swore some stupid oath and now you can never touch a girl
It was my choice to say the words
So you dont like girls
Of course I like girls But you chose never to touch them
Thats the price you pay if you want to be a man of the Nights Watch
So instead of getting naked with a girl youd prefer to invade our lands
Invade your lands Wildlings raid our lands all the time Some of them tried to kill my little brother a crippled boy
Yheyre not your lands Weve been here the whole time You lot came along and just put up a big wall and said it was yours
My father was Ned Stark I have the blood of the First Men My ancestors lived here same as yours
So why are you fighting us
Go on Now I want you to tell me what happened Come on this way Come on speak up Speak up
Wolfsbane A rare substance This is no common assassin
We hanged 20 men last night
I dont care if you hanged 100 A man tried to kill me I want his name and I want his head
We think it was an infiltrator from the Brotherhood Without Banners
Pretentious name for a band of outlaws We cant allow rebels behind our lines to harass us with impunity We look like fools and they look like heroes Thats how kings fall I want them dead every one
Killing them isnt the problem Its finding them Have you gone soft Clegane I always thought you had a talent for violence
Burn the villages burn the farms Let them know what it means to choose the wrong side
Mmm Is that mutton
Yes my lord
Dont like mutton
Ill bring something else
Leave it Are you hungry
No
Of course you are Eat
Ill eat in the kitchen later
Its bad manners to refuse a lords offer Sit Eat
Youre small for your age I suppose youve been underfed your whole life
I eat a lot I just dont grow
Mmm This will be my last war Win or lose
Have you ever lost before
Do you think Id be in my position if I had lost a war
But this is the one Ill be remembered for The War of Five Kings theyre calling it My legacy will be determined in the coming months
Do you know what legacy means Its what you pass down to your children and your childrens children Its what remains of you when youre gone Harren the Black thought this castle would be his legacy The greatest fortress ever built The tallest towers the strongest walls The Great Hall had 35 hearths Thirtyfive Can you imagine Look at it now A blasted ruin Do you know what happened
Dragons
Yes Dragons happened
Harrenhal was built to withstand an attack from the land A million men could have marched on these walls and a million men would have been repelled But an attack from the air with dragon fire Mmmmmm Harren and all his sons roasted alive within these walls Aegon Targaryen changed the rules Thats why every child alive still knows his name
Aegon and his sisters
Mmm
It wasnt just Aegon riding his dragon It was Rhaenys and Visenya too
Correct A student of history are you
Rhaenys rode Meraxes Visenya rode Vhagar
Im sure I knew that when I was a boy
Visenya Targaryen was a great warrior She had a Valyrian steel sword she called Dark Sister
Hmm Shes a heroine of yours I take it
Arent most girls more interested in the pretty maidens from the songs Jonquil with the flowers in her hair
Most girls are idiots
You remind me of my daughter Where did you learn all this stuff about Visenya and her Valyrian steel sword
From my father
He was a wellread stonemason Cant say Ive ever met a literate stonemason
Have you met many stonemasons my lord
Careful now girl I enjoy you but be careful Take that back to the kitchen Eat what you want
And girl
Mlord
Lowborn girls say mlord not my lord If youre going to pose as a commoner you should do it properly
My mother served Lady Dustin for many years my lord She taught me how to speak proper Properly
Youre too smart for your own good Has anyone told you that
Yes
Go on
I beg pardon ser I should have come to you after to thank you for saving me You were so brave
Brave A dog doesnt need courage to chase off rats
Does it give you joy to scare people
No it gives me joy to kill people
Spare me You cant tell me Lord Eddard Stark of Winterfell never killed a man
It was his duty He never liked it
Is that what he told you He lied Killing is the sweetest thing there is
Why are you always so hateful
Youll be glad of the hateful things I do someday when youre queen and Im all that stands between you and your beloved king
Ive demanded a meeting of the Thirteen One of them did this or knows who did
You are one of the Thirteen
If I wanted your dragons I would have taken them They mean nothing to me on their own
Nothing Theyre more valuable than anything in the world
Shall we look inside my vault and see what selling your dragons would buy me I cannot buy already We will get them back
There is no we so why would you help me get them back
I took you under my protection in front of the rulers of my city A man is what others say he is and no more If they say that Xaro Xhoan Daxos is a liar my word is worth nothing I cannot let this thing happen to you under my roof
But it did happen under your roof
Khaleesi many times in my life
I dont care where youve been
You think were savages because we dont live in stone castles We cant make steel as good as yours its true but Were free If someone tried to tell us we couldnt lie down as man and woman wed shove a spear up his arse We dont go serving some shit king whos only king because his father was
No No you serve Mance Rayder the King beyond the Wall
We chose Mance Rayder to lead us He was a crow same as you but he wanted to be free You could be free too You dont need to live your whole life taking commands from old men Wake up when you want to wake up I could show you the streams to fish the woods to hunt Build yourself a cabin and find a woman to lie with in the night
Youre a pretty lad The girls would claw each others eyes out to get naked with you
Walk
I could teach you how to do it
I know how to do it
You know nothing Jon Snow
And what did she say
She admired your spirit Your Grace
And what then
If every man were held accountable for the actions of every distant relative Ser Alton wed all hang
She tore the paper in half Your Grace
Youve acted with honor I thank you for it Lord Karstark see that Ser Altons pen is clean and give him a hot supper
Ser Altons pen is occupied Your Grace The prisoners from the Yellow Fork
Too many prisoners
Is there room for Ser Alton
Does he need to lie down
Have the men build him a new pen Put him in with the Kingslayer for now Have your boy watch over them
Torrhen
That will be all
Your Grace A minute of your time
Ive been treating your wounded men
And my enemies as some of my bannermen are fond of mentioning
Theyre not my enemies
Thats what I tell my bannermen
Ive already run through the supplies I brought with me Some are easily replaced Egg yolks turpentine oil of roses But some are not I need silk for stitching I need fennel root for those with fever willow bark Mostly I need milk of the poppy You saw what it was like to amputate a foot without any I assume there will be more loss of limb before this war is over
If you need help finding these
I know where to find them Im sorry I shouldnt interrupt you
Continue my lady
Youre riding to the Crag to negotiate a surrender
Yes
The Crag will have a maester and he will have what I need
I expect he will
If I could write a list
Come with me to the Crag
I dont think that will be
Let the maester show you his stores I want the wounded men to be treated well all the wounded men
Children come inside quick Come on
Hurry up
Cant find anything ser Theyve lost the scent
Try again
Weve circled this farmhouse twice Theres no sign of them
We could start the search fresh in the morning my lord
Im looking at spending the rest of my life being treated like a fool and a eunuch by my own people Ask yourself is there anything I wouldnt do to stop that from happening The hounds will find the scent again Ill beat them until they do Ill whip every man here until I have both those boys in hand And once Ive got them the pampered little shits Its better to be cruel than weak
Prince Theon
Where are they
Who mlord
The Stark boys Where are they
I dont know I seen no one
Think harder
I swear mlord I dont know
My lord over here I think Ive found what were looking for
Send the old man home
Go back to Winterfell Take him back
Theon dont do this
You came back
As soon as I heard Do you know anything
Irri is dead
I know She was a good
Shes dead She died alone She died for me and I couldnt protect her
Doreah
We cant find her She must be dead too I led my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse
I should have been here
You went to find me a ship
My place is by your side I shouldnt have left you alone with these people
These people 
They are not to be trusted
And who is to be trusted Who are my people The Targaryens I only knew one my brother and he would have let a thousand men rape me if it had got him the crown The Dothraki Most of them turned on me the day that Khal Drogo fell from his horse
Your people are in Westeros
The people in Westeros dont know Im alive
They will soon enough
And then what Theyll pray for my return Theyll wave dragon banners and shout my name Thats what my brother believed and he was a fool
You are not your brother
Trust me Khaleesi
There it is Trust me And its you I should trust Ser Jorah Only you I dont need trust any longer I dont want it and I dont have room for it
You are too young to be so
And you are too familiar
Forgive me Khaleesi No one can survive in this world without help No one Let me help you please Tell me how
Find my dragons
How long till we get back to your crows
Were close
What a day A halfday You dont know do you Do you even know where they are
Were close
What do you think theyll say when they hear about you and me
Nothing happened between you and me
I swear it Old Master King Crow ser we were only close together for warmth And then I felt it right up against me backside like a club I can show you the bruise on me tailbone And before I knew what was where his his Well it was all out in the open all angry as you like And I didnt want to want it but oh I did And he spread me legs and ruined The shame of it Now I can never marry a perfumed lord What will me poor savage father say
Turn back around
And I thought that we were done but he said Turn back around Ill tell you what Jon Snow Since its gonna be your word against mine and since you cant talk about it without blushing we may as well just
What right here in the muck
Ill keep you warm enough
Are you that afraid of it
Thats enough
Its nice and wet and warm
Enough
It dont have teeth
All right All right Gods youre dull
Should have took me while you had the chance
No no
No Oh no
Its all right Give me that
If the Queen sees I can have Joffreys children now
Help me flip it over
Where are you going
To tell Her Grace
Youll say nothing to anyone Do you understand
Your mother might have prepared you You flowered my dear No more
My mother told me but I thought it would be different
In what way
I thought it would be less Less messy
Wait until you birth a child
Youre a woman now Do you have any idea what that means
Im fit to bear children for the king
A prospect that once delighted you bringing little princes and princesses into the world the greatest honor for a queen
Joffrey has always been difficult Even his birth I labored a day and a half to bring him into this world You cannot imagine the pain I screamed so loudly I was sure Robert would hear me in the Kingswood
His Grace was not with you
Robert was hunting That was his custom Whenever my time was near my royal husband would flee to the trees with his huntsmen and his hounds And when he returned he would present me with some pelts or a stags head and I would present him with a baby Not that I wanted him there mind you I had Grand Maester Pycelle an army of midwives and I had my brother When they told Jaime he wasnt allowed in the birthing room he smiled and asked which one of them proposed to keep him out Joffrey will show you no such devotion
You may never love the king but you will love his children
I love His Grace with all my heart
Thats so very touching to hear Permit me to share some womanly wisdom with you on this very special day The more people you love the weaker you are Youll do things for them that you know you shouldnt do Youll act the fool to make them happy to keep them safe Love no one but your children On that front a mother has no choice
But shouldnt I love Joffrey Your Grace
You can try little dove
Who did you say your mother was again
Cinda Lannister
Is she the fat one
Well perhaps shes gotten a little larger than she
No no Theres only one fat Lannister If she was your mother youd know it
I squired for you once you know
When
The tournament the day of Willem Freys wedding
I went to Willem Freys wedding
You did Your squire had gotten so drunk the night before that he threw up
He threw up on his horse on the way to the tourney grounds What was his name
Bryan
Poor lad That was my brothers doing I seem to recall I remember you Youd never squired for anyone before
Thats right I ran up and volunteered Let me my lord Let me My father was furious Afraid Id embarrass our family in front of the Family
You didnt though
You really remember
You knew when you were needed and when to go away Its a rare talent Most of my squires they mean well but young men with big jobs they tend to overdo them
When I think back to that day
Shh
You were saying
I Never mind Its embarrassing
More embarrassing than being chained to a post covered in your own shit
I remember everything about that day your helmet your horse the rake lines in the dirt along the list where the sun was in the sky when you knocked Balon from his horse and the dent in your shield when you handed it back to me Ill remember it all until I die That was the best day of my life And I remember being on the field after it was over All the competitors were done I was the last one out there And I couldnt leave I couldnt bring myself to go and sit with my family at a table so far on the edge of the feast you could barely even see the bride And I couldnt bear to tell them what it had been like squiring for you when I knew that they could never have the faintest idea what I was talking about
I understand completely
How could you Sorry I I didnt mean to doubt you
Its just that I I was 16 once I also had to replace someones squire on short notice
Which knight was it
Barristan Selmy The fight against the Kingswood Outlaws Before your time
What was he like
He was A painter A painter who only used red I couldnt imagine being able to fight like that not back then And to help him do that to be a part of something that perfect I dont need to explain how that felt not to you
Its hard to put into words
Its like stepping into a dream youve been dreaming for as long as you can remember and finding out that the dream is more real than your life
Leaving that battlefield was like being dragged off to prison
Did you squire for him again
No I didnt have your gift He couldnt take a step without stepping on me I was awful a complete liability Until one of the outlaws decided to take on a 16yearold squire
Its a good thing I am who I am Id have been useless at anything else Im not wellsuited for imprisonment Shocking I know Some men are Ned Stark I imagine he made an excellent prisoner right up until the end Not me though My life has left me uniquely unfit for constraint
And have you thought about
Of course Every day
And
Good prisoners breed good jailers apparently The Starks are very careful
But there is a way I think It wasnt possible until now
What is it
Its actually quite simple
Well let me help you
Youll only have to do one thing
Tell me
Youll have to die
Jorah the Andal This man must sail past old Valyria All who travel too close to the doom must have protection
I didnt come here for lessons
No you came for the dragons
You have them Where are they
Draw your sword See what your steel is worth You want to please the Mother of Dragons
You love her
Where are the dragons
Will you betray her again Jorah the Andal
Will you betray her again
Never
The thief you seek is with her now
I did not leave the comfort of my home to come to yours and be called a thief
No one is calling you a thief Who is she to accuse us
Please theyre my children Im begging you
Begging us It wasnt very long ago you were threatening us
Without me the dragons will die
It will be for the best Your dragons will bring the world nothing but death and misery my dear If I knew where they were I would not tell you
You are cruel my friend The Mother of Dragons is in the right She must be reunited with her babies I will help you Khaleesi
How
I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them
You have my dragons
When I learned you were coming to our city I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth He procured them for me
But there is no King of Qarth
There is now That was the other half of the arrangement
You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change I will open Qarth to the world as I have forced it to open itself to me
Your ambition is an inspiration But like all upstarts you overreach Three dragons the size of cats and an alliance with a charlatan do not make you a king
An upstart and a charlatan Empires have been built by less Those on the margins often come to control the center and those in the center make room for them willingly or otherwise
The Mother of Dragons will be with her babies She will give them her love and they will thrive by her side forever
A mother should be with her children
Where will you run to Daenerys Stormborn Your dragons wait for you in the House of the Undying Come see them
Lady Stark
No farther
Keep your hands off me woman
Dont enter without an invitation man
Forgive me Lady Stark
What is it
They caught the Kingslayer
Kingslayer
Kill the fucking Kingslayer
Hang him
Hang him
Youll die today
Justice for the Karstark
Gut him
Get back I want his head Any man who stands between a father and his vengeance asks for death
Lord Karstark this man is our prisoner
This monster killed my son
And crippled mine He will answer for his crimes I promise you but not here
I will have his head And if you try and stop me
You will strike me down Have you forgotten me ser I am the widow of your liege Lord Eddard Stark I am the mother of your king
And where is our king now
You know very well
He has gone to the Crag to accept the surrender Aye gone to the Crag but not to negotiate He brought that foreign bitch with him
How dare you
Threatening my lady is an act of treason
Treason How can it be treason to kill Lannisters
I understand your grief my lord better than most I understand it But in the name of my son the King in the North stand down
When your son returns I will demand this murderers head
Wise men do not make demands of kings
Fathers who love their sons do I will have his head
Thank you for fighting on my behalf Lady Stark I would have come to your defense
Take him to the stockades Bind him with every chain you can find
Youve become a real shewolf in your later years Theres not much fish left in you
And gag him
Since when do you light your own candles
Since I decided that I cant stand to look at any of my handmaidens for another instant
How many times can you read one raven scroll
Stannis Baratheons fleet has been spotted sailing north past Tarth 200 ships
More than we have
Yes thats more than we have Hell be at our gates within five days four if he has the wind
We have strong high walls Well rain fire down on them from above
Rain fire on them from above Youre quoting Father arent you
Why not He has a good mind for strategy doesnt he
Call it tactics not strategy But yes he does have a good mind for it The best mind some would say Sadly hes not here Its just you me and Joffrey the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
Im sure youll make a point eventually
He needs to start acting like a king This war you started is coming to our doorstep And if the entire city wants Joffrey dead
Im not the one giving the boy whores to abuse
I thought the girls might help him
Did you
I was wrong If we cant control him
Do you think I havent tried He doesnt listen to me
Its hard to put a leash on a dog once youve put a crown on its head
I always hoped hed be like Jaime He looks like him In a certain light
The boy is more Robert than Jaime
Robert was a drunken fool but he didnt enjoy cruelty Sometimes I wonder What If this is the price for what weve done for our sins
Sins
The Targaryens Wed brother and sister for hundreds of years I know Thats what Jaime and I would say to each other in our moments of doubt Its what I told Ned Stark when he was stupid enough to confront me Half the Targaryens went mad didnt they Whats the saying Every time a Targaryen is born the Gods flip a coin
Youve beaten the odds Tommen and Myrcella are good decent children both of them
Then why wait
Were sworn to the king
Theres not a king
Thats treason
So is saving Lannisters yeah
Back off you
No I wont
Your son returns at dawn my lady
So they say
ingslayer wont last the night The more they drink the angrier theyll get And when the Karstarks draw their swords Who wants to die defending a Lannister
Come
I need to be alone with him
My lady
Your orders which I just gave you are to leave me alone with him
Come to say goodbye Lady Stark I believe its my last night in this world Is that a woman
Do you hear them out there They want your head
Old Lord Karstark doesnt seem to like me
You strangled his son with your chains
Oh Oh Was he the one on guard duty He was in my way Any knight would have done the same
You are no knight You have forsaken every vow you ever took
So many vows They make you swear and swear Defend the king obey the king obey your father protect the innocent defend the weak But what if your father despises the king What if the king massacres the innocent Its too much No matter what you do youre forsaking one vow or another Where did you find this beast
She is a truer knight than you will ever be Kingslayer
Kingslayer What a king he was Heres to Aerys Targaryen the Second of His Name Lord of the Seven Kingdoms Protector of the Realm and to the sword I shoved in his back
You are a man without honor
Do you know Ive never been with any woman but Cersei So in my own way I have more honor than poor old dead Ned What was the name of that bastard he fathered
Brienne
No that wasnt it Snow a bastard from the North Now when When good old Ned came home with some whores baby did you pretend to love it No Youre not very good at pretending Youre an honest woman You hated that boy didnt you How could you not hate him The walking talking reminder that the honorable Lord Eddard Stark fucked another woman
Your sword
I told you what would happen All of you I told you what would happen if you served me loyally And what would happen if you did not
What are you doing What have you done
If there are any who still question whether your new lord means what he says here is the answer to your question
No
Riders approaching
Open the gate
Why its the Prince of Winterfell
Envy isnt attractive
What envy
You should be proud of your brothers achievement I took the great castle of Winterfell with 20 men
Youre a great warrior I saw the bodies above your gates Which one gave you the tougher fight the cripple or the sixyearold
I treated the Stark boys with honor and they repaid me with treachery
You treated them with honor By butchering them
Before I had to kill them I treated them
You seized their home as is your right Were ironborn we take what we need
Exactly
Then you made them prisoners in their home and they ran away Is that treachery Id call it bravery
They made me a promise
Your little boy prisoners made you a promise and you got mad when they broke it Are you the dumbest cunt alive
Dont call me
A cunt A dumb cunt who killed the only two Starks in Winterfell You know how valuable those boys were
If I hadnt killed them the Northerners would think me weak
You are weak And youre stupid
Im warning you
Go on then Warn me
You havent brought enough men How am I supposed to defend Winterfell with just this lot
Youre not Ive come to bring you home Father wants a word
Is this a joke Winterfell is the heart of the North
Aye it is hundreds of miles from the sea Were islanders baby brother Had you forgotten that Our power comes from our ships And now that youve decorated your walls with the bodies of the Stark boys every man in the North wants to see you hanged When Robb Stark finds out
He wont find out Weve killed all the ravens We have all the horses Ive taken Winterfell And I will keep Winterfell
Leave us
Theon youre my blood We both loved our mother We both endured our father Come home with me Dont die here alone
I dont intend to die
You were a terrible baby do you know that Bawling all the time never sleeping And one night you just wouldnt shut up screaming like a dying pig I walked over to your crib I looked down at you I wanted to strangle you And you looked up at me and you stopped screaming You smiled at me Dont die so far from the sea
Ive brought you a present Lord of Bones
I already got one crow Dont need two
Mance will want to question this one Knows all about where the crows are and what theyre planning
The Halfhand knows more This one is just a little boy Gut him
He could have killed me half a dozen times
And now he wishes he did Gut him
Hes a bastard of Winterfell Ned Starks son Mance will want him
What does Mance want with a dead mans bastard
I dont know I think hell want to decide for himself
He runs Ill chop his balls off
He runs Ill do it meself
Were even now Jon Snow
I couldnt do it I had the sword on her neck
I know
The others
When you didnt come back we went looking for you We found your tracks fast enough But they found us before we found you
They died because of me
See that it wasnt for nothing
All right up lad
Come on on your feet now Move it
Is she beautiful
Ive never met her
Whats her name
Frey I suppose I dont know her first name
Im sure youll be very happy
And youre marrying her for a bridge
An important bridge
Ah
It was before they killed my father I still thought I could march south and rescue him in time but only if I crossed that bridge
When I speak to people from the North they all loved your father
He was the best man I ever met I know children always think that about their fathers
Children do not always think that about their fathers believe me
He once told me that being a lord is like being a father except you have thousands of children and you worry about all of them The farmers plowing the fields are yours to protect The charwomen scrubbing the floors yours to protect The soldiers you order into battle He told me he woke with fear in the morning and went to bed with fear in the night I didnt believe him I asked him How can a man be brave if hes afraid That is the only time a man can be brave he told me
I wish I could have met him
He would have liked you
Most lords worry more about their gold and their glory than the charwomen scrubbing their floors
He didnt care much about gold or glory
And you You think Im fighting this war so theyll sing songs about me I want to go home I want the men following me to go home
Then why dont you
Because well never be safe until the Lannisters are defeated And because I believe in justice
Chopping off Joffreys head you mean
That would be a start
Your Grace milady ingslayer he escaped in the night
How How
Tell me this isnt true
Why
For the girls
You betrayed me
No You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway
Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell Sansa and Arya are captives in Kings Landing I have five children and only one of them is free
I lost one son fighting by your sons side I lost another to the Kingslayer strangled with a chain You commit treason because your children are prisoners I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell
I grieve for your sons my lord
I dont want your grief I want my vengeance And you stole it from me
Killing Jaime Lannister would not buy life for your children but returning him to Kings Landing may buy life for mine
Jaime Lannister has played you for a fool Youve weakened our position Youve brought discord into our camp And you did it all behind my back Make sure shes guarded day and night
Robb How many men did we send in pursuit of the Kingslayer
Forty Your Grace
Send another 40 with our fastest horses
Robb
Damn
Youre much uglier in daylight Whats your name Im Jaime Lannister of Casterly Rock son of Tywin
A captive knight has a right to know his captors identity
Brienne of Tarth
Tarth Tarth Tarth Crescent moons and starbursts Lord Selwyn Tarth Your father Do you have any brothers and sisters my lady Its a long way to Kings Landing Might as well get to know one another
Have you known many men I suppose not Women Horses Ah
I didnt mean to give offense my lady Forgive me
Your crimes are past forgiveness Kingslayer
Why do you hate me so much Have I ever harmed you
Youve harmed others those you were sworn to protect the weak the innocent
Has anyone ever told you youre as boring as you are ugly
You will not provoke me to anger
I already have Look at you Youre ready to chop my head off Do you think you could Do you think you could beat me in a fair fight
Ive never seen you fight
The answer is no There are three men in the kingdoms who might have a chance against me Youre not one of them
All my life men like you have sneered at me And all my life Ive been knocking men like you into the dust
If youre so confident unlock my chains Lets see what happens
Do you take me for an idiot In
I took you for a fighter a man Pardon Woman of honor Was I wrong Youre afraid
Maybe one day well find out Kingslayer
Kings Landing will fall an hour after Stannis lands his force Its not too late for King Joffrey and Cersei and the court to ride west to safety
Surrender the Iron Throne
Better than seeing their heads mounted on the city gates Stannis will execute them all
No a king who runs will not be king for long Hes a Lannister Hell stand and fight Stannis two days from the capital and the wolf at my doorstep
The scouts assure us Robb Stark remains north of Ashemark
Ha The last time the scouts assured us of Starks movement he lured us into a trap Which is why my son is his prisoner
Too close to Casterly Rock
He sent a splinter force to recapture Winterfell The Greyjoys have done us a great favor Stark wont risk marching on Casterly Rock until hes at full force
Hes a boy and hes never lost a battle Hell risk anything at any time because he doesnt know enough to be afraid
Well ride at nightfall I want a full nights march before he knows were on the move Clegane youll maintain a garrison here at Harrenhal Track down this brotherhood and destroy them The girl has proven herself a good servant Shell stay on with you See that he doesnt get drunk in the evenings Hes poor company when hes sober but hes better at his work
Youve got some questions to answer
Who killed Ser Amory
I dont know Please
Give me the name Take this one out for the crows
I told you I dont know Please
Look its Yorens little cunt Used to be a boy now its a girl
Wheres Jaqen
Dont care Wheres your stick now bitch I promised to fuck you with it
Come on time to kill some wolves
You need sour cherries to make it right And the secret is you dry the stones and then you break them with a mallet Thats where the real flavor is You crush em up real fine And then when youre finished you sprinkle them over the piecrust
Wheres Jaqen
How would I know
I need him now Lord Tywins marching tonight
You need him
Hes helping me
I saw him
Where
Where
Ow
Where
They went riding out the gates a few hours ago
On patrol Let go of my ears
What do you want with him anyway
Mance is gonna march on the Wall When he does one brother inside his army will be worth 1000 fighting against it
Theyll never trust me
They might If you do what needs to be done
What
How does it feel knowing those men all died so you could skip through the snow with your little savage girl
I didnt
I should have known better trusting a traitors bastard
Hes not yours to kill crow TYRION Do you have to do that here
I like to keep me hands clean
Yes but do you have to do it here
You should start wearing the gold cloak
I dont want to wear a gold cloak
Youre commander of the City Watch You shouldnt be dressed like a common
A cloak slows you down in a fight Makes it hard to move quietly And the gold catches the light so youre nice and easy to spot at night
Well youre not sneaking through alleyways any longer Youre supposed to stand out
We had a deal and wearing a gold cloak wasnt part of it
Fine fine No gold cloak
What
What
What What Why are you staring at me
You dont want me cleaning me nails You dont want me looking your way Why am I here
To help me plan the defense of Kings Landing
Stannis will be here any day
And one of these explains how to beat him
An History of the Great Sieges of Westeros By Archmaester Shevelathin Shevelatesh
Chevalteesh Id swap all your books for a few good archers
My Lord Hand Commander I must compliment you on the gold cloaks performance these last few weeks Did you know there has been a marked drop in thievery
I did not know And how did you accomplish this marked drop in thievery
Me and the lads rounded up all the known thieves
For questioning
No Its just the unknown thieves we need to worry about now
We talked about this
Aye we talked about it Have you ever been in a city under siege Maybe this parts not in your books See its not the fighting that kills most people Its the starving Foods worth more than gold Noble ladies sell their diamonds for a sack of potatoes Things get bad enough the poor start eating each other
The thieves they love a siege Soon as the gates are sealed they steal all the food By the time its all over theyre the richest men in town
Given the circumstances my lord I believe extreme measures are warranted
Ah The Great Sieges of Westeros Thrilling subject Shame Archmaester ChVyalthan wasnt a better writer
Stannis knows Kings Landing He knows where the walls are strongest and he knows which gates are weakest The Mud Gate A good ram will batter it down in minutes and its only 50 yards from the water Thats where hell land
And if Stannis does attack the Mud Gate what is our plan
We could throw books at his men
We dont have that many books
We dont have that many men either
What do we have
Pig shit
Im not cut out for this sort of work
I always imagined meself doing something much worse
Were digging latrine pits at the end of the world I cant imagine anything much worse
You lack imagination
Where do you think Jon is right now
He went off with the Halfhand He didnt come back A betting man would go with dead
Hes not dead No Jons a great fighter
Well hes better than me and a lot better than you
Hes got a Valyrian steel sword
So did his father
And Qhorin Halfhand is the greatest ranger alive
Great rangers never get old is the problem Shit ones neither Its them in the middle that last a long time
What in seven hells is that
The First Men made these marks Help me with it
Look
If you find something youre not supposed to best thing to do is pretend youve never seen it
Thats a Nights Watch cloak
Its been here a long time
Oh Must be dragonglass
Dragonglass
The maesters call it obsidian
Why would a brother hide it here
I expect its cause he wanted somebody to find it
Mind where youre going
Im sorry
Where were you
A man has patrol duty
Tywin Lannister was right here and now hes gone
A girl owes one more name The Red God demands it Give the man a name
How long after I give you the name does it take you to kill someone
A minute an hour a month Death is certain the time is not
Hes taking his army to attack my brother I need him dead right now
This a man cannot do
You promised youd help me
Help was not promised lovely girl Only death There must be others Give a name any name
And youll kill them Anybody
By the Seven New Gods and the Old Gods beyond counting I swear it
All right Jaqen Hghar
A girl gives a man his own name
Thats right
Gods are not mocked This is no joking thing
Im not joking A man can go kill himself
Unname me
No
Please
Ill unname you
Thank you
If you help me and my friends escape
This would require more than one life This is not part of our bargain
Fine Jaqen Hghar
A girl lacks honor If I do this thing a girl must obey
A girl will obey
A girl and her friends will walk through the gate at midnight
Thank you Podrick
Odd little boy
I have a certain sympathy for odd little boys
You and Varys both
Excellent lamprey pie Were you slaving away in the kitchen all day I hear Joffrey plans on fighting An inspiration for the troops The young king in his shining armor fighting to defend the capital against the wicked old rebel
Hes only a boy
Younger boys are off fighting his war
Hes not ready
What is he 17 Remember Jaime at 17
Better than you Some men have a gift for this sort of thing some dont His place is not on the battlefield
Its not on the throne either sadly for all of us
Do you think Im an idiot
No Id say you possess aboveaverage intelligence
You shipped off my only daughter And now you want to send my eldest son to the battlefield to die
Hell have his Kingsguard protecting him He has the finest armor gold can buy He needs to be out there The men will fight more fiercely seeing their king fighting beside them instead of hiding behind his mothers skirts Any dessert
Do you know why Varys is so dangerous
Because he has thousands of spies in his employ Because he knows everything we do before we do it
Because he doesnt have a cock
Neither do you
Perhaps Im dangerous too You on the other hand are as big a fool as every other man That little worm between your legs does half your thinking
Its not that little
Why are you smiling
Because Im happy
And why are you happy
Because I have your little whore
I thought you preferred blondes
Such a droll little fellow Tell me have you married this one yet No Good Father will be so pleased
Why do you care who I fuck
Because a Lannister always pays her debts You stole my only daughter you plot to have Joffrey killed
This is madness Stannis will be here in days You need me
For what Your skill in battle Pretty thing your whore Lovely body The bruises will heal in time
Where did you find her
Varys isnt the only one who hears whispers Really a Lannister lion necklace You need to hide your secret whores more carefully
Youve forgotten the most important thing about whores
Oh Well youre the expert Tell me
You dont buy them you only rent them
Youre usually a better liar baby brother This one you like You like her very much Could it be love Dont worry shell be treated gently enough Unless Joffrey is hurt And then every wound he suffers shell suffer too And if he dies there isnt a man alive who could devise a more painful death for your little cunt
And how do I know you havent killed her already
Would you like to see her I thought you might Ser Mandon bring in my brothers whore
Im sorry they hurt you You must be brave
I promise I will free you
Dont forget me
Never
I will hurt you for this A day will come when you think youre safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth And you will know the debt is paid
Get out
Shae
Ive been waiting all night What is wrong
Youre beautiful
Then why do you look sad
We have to be more careful
Dont be afraid I can take care of myself
There are people who want to hurt me
I know I wont let them Ill cut off their faces I will
I would kill for you Do you know that I expect Ill have to before this is over Youre mine
Im yours
Promise me
Im yours and you are mine
Still no word
Weve sent a dozen ravens None have returned My bastard is only a few days from Winterfell Once he captures the castle
Theon has my brothers If we storm the castle
He wouldnt dare hurt the boys Theyre his only hope of escaping the North with his head
Send word to your son Any ironborn who surrender will be allowed to return safely to their homes
A touch of mercy is a virtue Your Grace
Any ironborn with the exception of Theon Greyjoy He betrayed our cause He betrayed me And we will hunt him down no matter where he runs
I expect his countrymen will turn on him the minute they hear the offer
Your pardon my lord Your Grace
My lady
How are you
How am I Ive had to arrest my mother The Lannisters have my sisters The man I considered my closest friend has seized my home and my brothers Im fighting a war and I dont know if I should march south or north
Im sorry It was a stupid question Im sorry
No Forgive me Youre being kind I have no right
You have every right Youre a king
Thats not the kind of king I want to be
What kind do you want to be
I dont know The good kind Most kings grew up as princes They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell
I was raised to be a proper little lady to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry
Id like to hear you play the harp
No No you would not
How did you go from reciting Valyrian poetry to sawing off mens feet
When I was 12 my mother and father went to a wedding Weddings in Volantis last for days you know And they left me with my little brother The second afternoon they were gone was the hottest day in the threeyear summer We couldnt bear to be inside so we ran down to the Rhoyne Every child in Volantis was in the Rhoyne that day The rich the poor we were all there Naked screaming racing to the little islands Drummers were playing for coppers on the east bank I was treading water talking to a friend when I realized I hadnt seen my brother I called his name Then I started screaming his name And then I saw him floating face down My heart just stopped I was I dragged him from the water My friend helped me I think I dont even remember He was so little Then we pulled him onto the riverbank And I screamed at him and I shook him And he was dead Just dead A man ran over He had a fish tattoo on his face In Volantis the slaves have tattoos So you know what they are without having to talk to them And this man worked on a fishing boat And he pushed me out of the way You have to understand for a slave to push a highborn girl thats death for the man a terrible death But he pushed me out of the way and he started pressing on my brothers chest again and again and again until my brother spat out half of the Rhoyne and cried out And the man cradled his head and told him to be calm I decided two things that day I would not waste my years planning dances and masquerades with the other noble ladies And when I came of age I would never live in a slave city again Im sorry Your Grace You told me of your problems and Ive blathered on
I dont want to marry the Frey girl
I dont want you to marry her
But you needed that bridge I hope its a very beautiful bridge
The sour cherries was all crushed up and ready
Shut up
Probably in the piecrust by now In the oven The nice warm oven
Shut up What did you bring
The cheese could be better I did get some nice sausages GENDRY What did he want us to do about those guards
He didnt say He just said Walk through the gates
What about the guards
He didnt say anything about the guards
What he left that bit out Its a pretty important part dont you think
We have to trust him
Trust him You trusted him to fight with us when you set him free and he ran
I want to go back to the kitchens
Shut up Stay here if youre afraid
Arry dont
Away Reset
If the wind holds well reach Kings Landing in a day
Will it hold
Cant make promises for the wind Your Grace
Again pull
I admire you Ser Davos
I thank you Your Grace
Pleased to hear it Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you So you take the onion for your sigil sew it on your coat fly the onion flag
My son wishes me to change it Three mermen with tridents something like that I understand why the older families look down at me
Do you Why
My father was a crabber
And
Well sons of lords dont like to break bread with sons of crabbers Our hands stink
And where were those lords when Storms End starved
Many fought bravely for your brother Many fought for the Mad King
You defend these men who insult you behind your back
Some are happy to do it to my face
We were forgotten Robert and Ned Stark they were the heroes The glorious rebels marching from battle to battle liberating towns from the yoke of the Mad King while I held Storms End with 500 men
No one has forgotten Your Grace
No Robert did He gave Storms End to Renly after the war Renly never fought a day in his life
He was only a boy
Then whyd he give him Storms End
First we ate the horses We werent riding anywhere not with the castle surrounded We couldnt feed them so fine the horses Then the cats Never liked cats So fine I do like dogs Good animals Loyal But we ate them Then the rats The night before you slipped through I thought my wife was dying She couldnt speak anymore she was so frail And then you made it through the lines Slipped right through in your little black sailboat with your onions
And potatoes Some salted beef I believe
Every man in Storms End wanted to kiss you that night
I was relieved they did not
Robert told me to hold Storms End so I held it Then he told me he was giving it to Renly so I gave it up Insult or no I gave it up Because Robert was my older brother and he was the king and Ive always done my duty But now Im the rightful king by every law of Westeros And when I sit the Iron Throne youll be my Hand
Your Grace I pray I serve you well
I expect youll be the first crabbers son to wear the badge
Youre the Master of Whisperers Youre supposed to know everything
No man can be in all rooms at all times I have many little birds in the North my lord but I havent heard their songs since Theon Greyjoy captured Winterfell
The Stark forces are distracted Now is the time to strike
To strike My dear nephew you do see these men preparing the walls for siege You do understand Stannis Baratheon sails this way
If my Uncle Stannis lands on the shores of Kings Landing Ill ride out to greet him
A brave choice Your Grace Im sure your men will line up behind you
They say Stannis never smiles Ill give him a red smile from ear to ear
Imagine Stannis terror
I am trying
Youre an intelligent man Id like to think Im an intelligent man
Oh no one disputes that my lord not even the multitudes who despise you
I wish we could converse as two honest intelligent men
I wish we could too
What do you want Tell me
If were going to play youll have to start
My brother was the youngest Kingsguard in history My sister became queen at the age of 19 When I reached manhood my father put me in charge of all the drains and cisterns in Casterly Rock
A most highborn plumber
The water never flowed better And all the shit found its way to the sea I never expected to have any real power So when my father named me acting Hand
Youre quite good at being Hand you know Jon Arryn and Ned Stark were good men Honorable men But they disdained the game and those who played You enjoy the game
I do Last thing I expected
And you play it well
Id like to keep playing it If Stannis breaches the gates the game is over
They say he burns his enemies alive to honor the Lord of Light
The Lord of Light wants his enemies burned the Drowned God wants them drowned Why are all the gods such vicious cunts Where is the god of tits and wine
In the Summer Isles they worship a fertility goddess with 16 teats
We should sail there immediately
This morning I heard a song all the way from Qarth beyond the Red Waste Daenerys Targaryen lives
A girl at the edge of the world is the least of our problems
She has three dragons But even if what they say is true itll be years before they are fully grown And then there will be nowhere to hide
One game at a time my friend
Careful Khaleesi Xaro owns this city and the warlocks have a thousand eyes watching for you I found one A ship with a good captain She leaves for Astapor tomorrow
Astapor
We cannot stay here
They have my dragons A mother does not flee without her children
Theyre not your children I know they call you the Mother of Dragons and I know you love them but you didnt grow them in your womb They didnt suckle at your breast They are dragons Khaleesi And if we stay in Qarth well die
You should sail to Astapor Im sure youll be safe there
You know I would die for you I will never abandon you Im sworn to protect you to serve
Then serve me If my dragons are in the House of the Undying then take me there
Thats what the warlock wants He told you so himself If you enter that place you will never leave again His magic is strong
And what of my magic You saw me step into the fire You watched the witch burn What did the flames do to me Do you remember
Until my last breath I will remember After I have forgotten my mothers face
They are my children And they are the only children I will ever have Take me to them
We should bury them
Id leave em up a few more days Sends a message
If they havent got the damn message yet a few more days wont help As you say But it dont hurt to let em rot a while longer
Whats this
Gold for the farmer For his trouble
His troubles are done Hes feeding the crops now
His wife too You want to keep a man silent you silence him
Got as far as the farm and then doubled back Walked through the stream to throw off the hounds Hoped this would be the last place theyd think to look
Youre right so far
Who was that out there hung up at the gates
Must have been the farmers boys
He killed them and burned them and passed them off as the little lords
They mustnt know Bran would blame himself
Thats it The tides against us
Aye but we have the wind Shell blow us straight to the gates
Youre coming home
Kings Landing hasnt been home for 20 years I spent most of my life dodging the royal fleet And now Im sailing right at them
This is the royal fleet And youre not a smuggler anymore youre the high captain
Of course there are several royal fleets at the moment
Not after tonight When the sun rises Stannis will sit on the Iron Throne and you will be his Hand
Gods be good
God Father there is only one and he watches over us
But not over them
Over all of us The people of Kings Landing did not choose the false king Joffrey Baratheon They will be glad to see his head on a spike
Well first we have to put it there
Our ships outnumber theirs 10to1
Our army outnumber theirs 5to1 Those walls have never been breached and the men guarding the walls when they see you they dont see a liberator they see a stranger come to set their city on fire
I have faith in the Lord of Light I have faith in our cause And I have faith in my captain
Are you afraid my lion
If the city falls Stannis will burn every Lannister he can find Of course Im afraid
I wont let them hurt you
Im a Lannister I dont have a choice in all this But its not your war
It is now
You cant fuck your way out of everything
I have so far Do you remember what you said when you met me in your tent That I should make love to you like it was your last day on this earth
As you know Your Grace it is not only the sworn duty of a maester to carry out the wishes of the house he serves but also to offer guidance and counsel in times of war
Your words are always wise and measured
If you could If anything a maesters duties become more urgent in times of war and turmoil I remember back in the days of King
You brought me something
Yes Essence of nightshade is as dangerous as it is efficacious A single drop in a cup of wine suffices to soothe ragged nerves Three drops will bring on a deep and dreamless sleep Ten drops
I know what ten drops will bring
Your Grace if I may ask
You may not You must have a lot of work to do Im sure many brave men will need your wisdom soon
Yes A siege is very
Be careful on the stairs Grand Maester There are so many
Your Grace
And so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains weep oer his halls With no one there to hear Yes now the rains weep oer his halls And not a soul to hear
To the boys
Lannisters Whered you learn the Lannister song
Drunk Lannisters
Youve got a pretty voice
Thank you very much
And I like your nose How many times you break it
Well now lets see First time I was five My mam smacked me with an iron poker
Oh
It wasnt me she was aiming at She was trying for my little brother Now he was a real pest
Second time I was nine Got in a scrap with a few older boys They won
Eh you dont want to know about the third time
Poor nose
Dont feel sorry for him Hell be halfway up your arse before the nights through
Welcome friends This rounds on me
I dont think he likes me
You think youre a hard man
I know it
Its warm in here Weve got beautiful women and good brown ale Plenty for everyone And all you want is to put one of us in the cold ground with no women to keep us company
Oh theres women in the ground I put some there myself So have you You like fucking and drinking and singing But killing killings the thing you love Youre just like me
Only smaller
And quicker Eh
Your Lord Imps going to miss you
Aye I expect he will someday
Here we are
One more drink before the war Shall we
TYRIONS CHAMBERs
Ive always hated the bells They ring for horror A dead king a city under siege
A wedding
Exactly Podrick is that it
Is that it Nice touch As if you dont know the name of every boy in town
Im not entirely sure what youre suggesting
Im entirely sure youre entirely sure what Im suggesting
Do you trust him
Oddly enough I do
Good
The map you asked for
There must be 20 miles of tunnels beneath the city
Closer to 50 The Targaryens built this city to withstand a siege and to provide escape if necessary
Im not escaping Strange as it sounds Im the captain of the ship and if the ship goes down I go with her
That is good to hear Though Im sure many captains say the same while their ship is afloat You look well suited for battle my lord
Well Im not
For all our sakes I hope you are wrong My little birds tell me that Stannis Baratheon has taken up with a red priestess from Asshai
What of it
You dont believe in the old powers my lord
Blood spells curses shapeshifting What do you think
I think you believe in what you see and in what those you trust have seen You probably dont entirely trust me
Mmm dont take it personally I dont entirely trust myself
And yet I have seen things and heard things things you have not things I wish I had not I dont believe Ive ever told you how I was cut
No I dont believe you have
One day I will The dark arts have provided Lord Stannis with his armies and paved his path to our door For a man in service to such powers to sit on the Iron Throne I can think of nothing worse And tonight I believe you are the only man who can stop him
Theyre welcoming the new king
Ive never known bells to mean surrender They want to play music with us Lets play Drums
Drums
Remember wait till the ships
The ships are in the bay
They must be far enough in
I know what in means Do you know how to use that
I chopped wood once No I watched my brother chopping wood
I saw you kill a man with a shield Youll be unstoppable with an ax
Dont get killed
Nor you my friend
Oh are we friends now
Of course we are Just because I pay you for your services doesnt diminish our friendship
Enhances it really
Oh Enhances Fancy word for a sellsword
Been spending time with fancy folks
Lady Sansa and Sheila
Shae
Shae yes Surely my sister has asked you to join the other highborn ladies in Maegors holdfast
She has my lord but King Joffrey sent for me to see him off
Sansa
Always been a great romantic my nephew
Sansa come here
I will pray for your safe return my lord
Will you
Just as I pray for the kings
Stay safe my lady
And you my lion
Your king rides forth to battle You should see him off with a kiss
My new blade Hearteater Ive named it Kiss it
Youll kiss it again when I return and taste my uncles blood
Will you slay him yourself
If Stannis is fool enough to come near me
So youll be outside the gates fighting in the vanguard
A king doesnt discuss battle plans with stupid girls
Im sorry Your Grace Youre right Im stupid Of course youll be in the vanguard They say my brother Robb always goes where the fighting is thickest And he is only a pretender
Your brothers turn will come Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater too
Some of those boys will never come back
Joffrey will The worst ones always live
Shh Come my lady
Wheres our fleet
On the way
Why isnt it here now Theyre coming
Hound tell the Hand that his king has asked him a question
The king has asked you a question
Ser Lancel tell the Hound to tell the king that the Hand is extremely busy
The Hand of the King would like me to tell you to tell the king
If I tell the Hound to cut you in half hell do it without a second thought
That would make me the quarterman It just doesnt have the same ring to it Cut me in half and I wont be able to give the signal No signal no plan No plan and Stannis Baratheon sacks this city takes the Iron Throne puts your pinched little head atop a gate somewhere It might be quite amusing except that my head would be up there too Ive never much liked my head but I dont want to see it removed just yet
Where are their ships
It was wise to attack at night We took them by surprise
Lord Varys knows what you had for breakfast three days ago There are no surprises here
If its true there is dissension in their ranks maybe their sailors have mutinied
Maybe
I dont know why she wants me here Shes always saying how stupid I am She hates me
Maybe she hates you less than she hates everyone else
I doubt it
Maybe shes jealous of you
Why would she be jealous
Sansa
I was wondering where our little dove had flown You look pale child Is your red flower still blooming
Yes
Fitting isnt it The men will bleed out there and you will bleed in here Pour Lady Sansa some wine
Im not thirsty Your Grace
So I didnt offer you water Whats he doing here
Ser llyn Hes here to defend us When the axes smash down those doors you may be glad to have him
But we have guards to defend us
Guards we have paid Should the city fall theyll be the first ones out of the doors
The lads caught a groom and two maids trying to sneak away with a stolen horse and some gold cups
The battles first traitors Have Ser llyn see to them Put their heads on spikes outside the stables as a warning
The only way to keep the small folk loyal is to make certain they fear you more than they do the enemy Remember that if you ever hope to become a queen
You said he was here to protect us
He is Traitors are a danger to us all More wine
There they are
Archers to their marks
Archers to your marks
Archers Nock your arrows
Nock arrows
Hold fast
Hold fast
What are you doing We need to attack them
Hold fast
Boulders ready
Hold fast
Theres only one ship Where are the rest of them Where are the rest of them
Theres only one ship
Archers stand to Man the below Nock
Nock and set
Draw Hold
Hold
Theres no one on board
More rocks coming up
Hold
Wildfire Steer clear Steer clear The flaming arrow soars ove s boat and hits the wildfire in the water which erupts in green flame The flames crawl towards the ghost ship
Matthos Get down The explosion engulfs the fleet Meet scream in agony devoured in green flame some jumping overboard The immensity of the explosion is stunning Chaos ensues on board as the ships collapse
Prepare to land
Your Grace
The dwarf has played his little trick
The wildfire
He can only play it once
Were too far from the gates The fire their archers Hundreds will die
Thousands
Come with me and take this city
Sansa come here little dove
My queen What are you doing Praying
Youre perfect arent you
Praying
What are you praying for
For the gods to have mercy on us all
Oh On all of us
Yes Your Grace
Even me
Of course Your Grace
Even Joffrey
Joffrey is my
Oh shut up you little fool Praying to the gods to have mercy on us all The gods have no mercy Thats why theyre gods My father told me that when he caught me praying My mother had just died you see I didnt really understand the concept of death the finality of it I thought that if I prayed very very hard the gods would return my mother to me I was four
Your father doesnt believe in the gods
He believes in them he just doesnt like them very much
One for her
Here Sit Drink
Not like that Drink girl
I should have been born a man Id rather face a thousand swords than be shut up inside with this flock of frightened hens
They are your guests under your protection You asked them here
It was expected of me as it will be of you if you ever become Joffreys queen If my wretched brother should somehow prevail these hens will return to their cocks and crow of how my courage inspired them lifted their spirits
And if the city should fall
Youd like that wouldnt you The Red Keep should hold for a time long enough for me to go to the walls and yield to Lord Stannis in person If it were anyone else outside those gates I might have hoped for a private audience but this is Stannis Baratheon Id have a better chance of seducing his horse
Have I shocked you little dove Tears arent a womans only weapon The best ones between your legs Learn how to use it Drink
Do you have any notion of what happens when a city is sacked No you wouldnt would you If the city falls these fine women should be in for a bit of a rape Half of them will have bastards in their bellies come the morning Youll be glad of your red flower then When a mans blood is up anything with tits looks good A precious thing like you will look very very good A slice of cake just waiting to be eaten
More pressure Pull Pull Thats it men Pull Pull
Hes a serious man Stannis Baratheon
Theyre coming Theyre coming ashore

Any man dies with a clean sword Ill rape his fucking corpse He and LANCEL engage with the sieging forces They each cut down a number of Baratheon men before LANCEL is struck in the chest by an arrow He stumbles and screams Panting he retreats
When we were young Jaime and I we looked so much alike even our father couldnt tell us apart I could never understand why they treated us differently Jaime was taught to fight with sword and lance and mace and I was taught to smile and sing and please He was heir to Casterly Rock and I was sold to some stranger like a horse to be ridden whenever he desired
You were Roberts queen
And you will be Joffreys Enjoy I dont think I know this one

And wolves
My lord
He could hear them howling in the night The little cub was frightened His mother said You are a lion my son You mustnt be afraid
For one day all the beasts will bow to you You will be king All the stags will bow All the wolves will bow The bears in the north and the foxes of the south all the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea they will all come to you little lion to rest a crown upon your head

Would you like something for the pain
What happened
The murderer and traitor Stannis Baratheon suffered a stunning defeat at the hands of your father
Where am I
These are your new chambers A little cramped perhaps but you dont need much room do you You are no longer Hand of the King
Oh For your trouble
I Joffrey of the House Baratheon first of my name the rightful King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm do hereby proclaim my grandfather Tywin Lannister the savior of the city and the Hand of the King
Thank you Your Grace
Lord Petyr Baelish step forward
For your good service and ingenuity in uniting the Houses of Lannister and Tyrell I declare that you shall be granted the castle of Harrenhal with all its attendant lands and incomes to be held by your sons and grandsons from this day until the end of time
You honor me beyond words Your Grace I shall have to acquire some sons and grandsons
Ser Loras Tyrell
Your house has come to our aid The whole realm is in your debt none more so than I If your family would ask anything of me ask it and it shall be yours
Your Grace my sister Margaery her husband was taken from us before She remains innocent I would ask you to find it in your heart to do us the great honor of joining our houses
Is this what you want Lady Margaery
With all my heart Your Grace I have come to love you from afar Tales of your courage and wisdom have never been far from my ears And those tales have taken root deep inside of me
I too have heard tales of your beauty and grace but the tales do not do you justice my lady It would be an honor to return your love but I am promised to another A king must keep his word
Your Grace in the judgment of your Small Council it would be neither proper nor wise for you to wed the daughter of a man beheaded for treason a girl whose brother is in open rebellion against the throne as we speak For the good of the realm your councilors beg you to set Sansa Stark aside
Margaery We want Margaery
I would like to heed your wishes and the wishes of my people but I took a holy vow
Your Grace the gods do indeed hold betrothal solemn but your father blessed be his memory made this pact before the Starks revealed their falseness I have consulted with the High Septon and he assures me that their crimes against the realm free you from any promise you have made to them in the sight of the gods
The gods are good I am free to heed my heart Ser Loras I will gladly wed your sweet sister You will be my queen and I will love you from this day until my last day
My lady My sincerest condolences
Theyre right Im not good enough for him
You shouldnt say that Youll be good enough for many things Hell still enjoy beating you And now that youre a woman hell be able to enjoy you in other ways as well
But if hes not marrying me
Hell let you go home Joffreys not the sort of boy who gives away his toys You have a tender heart just like your mother did at your age I can see so much of her in you She was like a sister to me For her sake Ill help get you home
Kings Landing is my home now
Look around you Were all liars here And every one of us is better than you
Come in Make yourself comfortable
That doesnt look very comfortable Here watch me
No need for that my dear
You sure Most men like what they see
Im not like most men
Thats what most men say
If you dont want what most men want then youd better tell me what youd like me to do
I would like you to tell me if working for Lord Baelish has been all youd hoped it would be
Have we met
You wouldnt remember me if we had
I meet a lot of men
And I think you remember all of them I think your true talents are wasted on them
Youre very kind my lord Allow me to return the favor
Youre afraid Why Nothing dangerous down there
I know who you are
And unlike your current employer I protect those who work for me I dont abuse them to satisfy royal whims or force them to abuse each other
How do you know about that
I thought you said you knew who I was
What can I do for you Lord Varys
Littlefinger looks at you and sees a collection of profitable holes I see a potential partner
Im afraid of him
Oh you should be Hes a dangerous man But everyone has their weaknesses Your current employer hides his very well but not as well as he thinks
Youre a virgin I take it
Walk
Childhood must have been awful for you Were you a foot taller than all the boys They laughed at you called you names Some boys like a challenge One or two must have tried to get inside Big Brienne
One or two tried
Ah But you fought them off But maybe you wished one of them could overpower you fling you down tear off your clothes But none of them were strong enough Im strong enough
Not interested
Of course you are Youd love to know what it feels like to be a woman
Ah They lay with lions Tavern girls Id say Probably served my fathers soldiers Maybe one of them gave up a kiss and a feel Thats how they earned this The glorious work of the Northern freedom fighters Must make you proud to serve the Starks
I dont serve the Starks I serve Lady Catelyn
Tell yourself that tonight when they swing in your dreams
What are you doing
Burying them
We shouldnt stay here We should get back on the river
I think these women would understand if I dont care what you think
I didnt leave it here
I had me dagger
Untie me Now
I gave it to you to cut the rope and now I dont have me dagger no more
So unless it got stuck in your arse on its way to your cunt it stands to reason that its gone Whoa Whats your business here
Traveling a prisoner
Youre a woman A woman
Well fuck me
If youve quite finished up
All right well be going
Whoa Whoa Who do you fight for
The Starks MAN 2 What did he do
Apparently eating is now a crime Who knew
No stealing is a crime
But its not a crime to starve Thats justice for you
Where are you taking him
To Riverrun
Why Riverrun
Steal from the Tullys its their dungeons you rot in
Why not kill him
For stealing a pig
I dont give the orders He must be important to someone
Sending him with you How important could he be
All right have it your way my lady
Do I know you
Have you been to Ashemark
No
Then you dont know me
Do you ever go to the river market at Salt Rock
Is it near Ashemark
No
Ive never been there
What do you think of these beauties
I hope you gave them quick deaths
Two of them we did yeah
Wait I do know you Thats Jaime Lannister
I wish someone had told me I wouldnt have had to steal that pig
If this is the Kingslayer I think Id know about it
How do you know what the Kingslayer looks like
I was at Whispering Wood I saw him They dragged him out of the woods and threw him down before the king
Hes not the Kingslayer Sorry to disappoint you If he was Id only be traveling his head
I have a question for you both And I want you to answer it at the same time I count to three you both answer Whats his name One Two Three
Two quick deaths
Those were Stark men
I dont serve the Starks I serve Lady Catelyn I told you Id take you to Kings Landing and thats what Im going to do Stay
Walder Frey is a dangerous man to cross
I know that
And you mean to do it anyway
I love her
I know that seems important to you
It is important to me
Your father didnt love me when we married He hardly knew me or I him Love didnt just happen to us We built it slowly over the years stone by stone for you for your brothers and sisters for all of us Its not as exciting as secret passion in the woods but it is stronger It lasts longer
And that is what would be in store for me with one of Walder Freys daughters what you and father had
Why not Because shes not beautiful Because shes not exotic and exciting
Now youre arguing just to argue because you arranged it
And you agreed to it You gave him your word Treat your oaths recklessly and your people will do the same If your father lived his life for one thing
My father is dead And the only parent I have left has no right to call anyone reckless
You said you saw my victory in the flames
l I did I still see it
The flames lied And Im no better than a savage trusting in a fire god I fought for your god in Blackwater Bay I led my men to the gates of the seventh hell as their brothers burned alive and for what Attacked from behind by Tywin Lannister and the Tyrells If you see so much in your flames why didnt you warn me
The Lord of Light only allows me glimpses
You claimed to speak for a god
Will you quit the war just because youve lost a battle
You talk about war as if you understand it
Ive been fighting far longer than you
Have you Show me how you fight
Show me
Wheres your god now Will he save you Where is your god
Inside you
I murdered my brother
We murdered him Share the weight with me
He wasnt your brother
This war has just begun It will last for years Thousands will die at your command You will betray the men serving you You will betray your family You will betray everything you once held dear And it will all be worth it because you are the Son of Fire You are the Warrior of Light You will sweep aside this pretender and that one You will be king
You promise these things but you dont know None of us know
Let me show you
Look into the fire my king Look
I see fire
Keep looking Do you see Do you see my king
Yes
I will kill that man I dont care how many arrows they feather me with how many spears they run through me I will kill that hornblowing cunt before I fall
They want you to know youre surrounded
I know Im surrounded I know that because I stood on the battlements and saw I was surrounded
They dont want you to sleep They want to sap your spirit before
Thank you wise bald man Thank you for explaining siege tactics to me
No word from my father
No
Send more ravens
You killed all the ravens
The first time I saw Winterfell
First time I saw Winterfell it looked like something that had been here for thousands of years and would be here for thousands of years after I was dead I saw it and I thought Of course Ned Stark crushed our rebellion and killed my brothers We never stood a chance against the man who lives here
Lord Stark went out of his way to make it your home
Yes my captors were so very kind to me You love reminding me of that Everyone in this frozen pile of shit has always loved reminding me of that You know what its like to be told how lucky you are to be someones prisoner To be told how much you owe them And then to go back home to your real father
I will kill that man I swear to the Drowned God the Old Gods the New Gods to every fucking god in every fucking heaven I will kill that man
Theon listen to me I serve Winterfell Now Winterfell is yours Im bound by oath to serve you
And whats your counsel trusted friend
Run
Five hundred Northmen wait outside the walls You have 20 men You cant win Wait for nightfall and run
Theres nowhere to run Id never make it back to the Iron Islands And even if I did even if by some miracle I slipped through the lines and made it home Id be a coward The Greyjoy who ran The shame of the family
Dont go home Join the Nights Watch
Once a man has taken the black hes beyond reach of the law All his past crimes are forgiven
I wont make it to the Wall I wont make it 10 feet past the Winterfell gates
There are ways Hidden passageways built so the Lords of Winterfell could escape The road will be dangerous But with a little luck
The Nights Watch is an ancient honorable order Youll have opportunities there
The opportunity for Jon Snow to cut my throat in my sleep
The opportunity to make amends for what youve done
Ive done a lot havent I Things I never imagined myself doing
Ive known you many years Theon Greyjoy Youre not the man youre pretending to be Not yet
You may be right But Ive gone too far to pretend to be anything else
You hear that Thats the mating call of the Northmen They want to fuck us Well I havent had a good fuck in weeks Im ready for one
They say every ironborn man is worth a dozen from the mainland
Aye
You think theyre right
Aye
We die today brothers We die bleeding from 100 wounds with arrows in our necks and spears in our guts but our war cries will echo through eternity They will sing about the battle of Winterfell until the Iron Islands have slipped beneath the waves Every man woman and child will know who we were and how long we stood Aggar and Gelmarr Wex and Urzen Stygg and Black Lorren Ironborn warriors will cry out our names as they leap onto the shores of Seagard and Faircastle
Aye
Mothers will name their sons for us
Aye
Girls will think of us with their lovers inside them
Aye
And whoever kills that fucking hornblower will stand in bronze above the shores of Pyke
Aye
What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die
Thought hed never shut up
It was a good speech Didnt want to interrupt
What is this What are you doing
Lets go home
Come on
Why should I believe you
Why would I lie about it
To create strife between my sister and me
Where before there was nothing but love Ser Mandon Moore tried to kill you on your sisters orders If it werent for your squires bravery youd be a dead man
Pod
Yes my lord
Would it be excessive of me to ask you to save my life twice in a week
No my lord
Youre a good lad Get Bronn tell him I want four of his most loyal gold cloaks outside my door at all times
Im afraid your friend has been relieved of his command of the City Watch The gold cloaks are now firmly in the hands of your father or your sister It varies from cloak to cloak
Then my hill tribesmen
Have gone home Your father paid them quite handsomely Im afraid we wont be seeing each other for some time my lord
Dont want to swim too close to a drowning man And I thought we were friends
We are Podrick would you mind
There are many who know that without you this city faced certain defeat The king wont give you any honors the histories wont mention you but we will not forget
Come along now Podrick
My love
It was good of you to come
Good of me Of course I come
I want to see you
Believe me you dont
Have you looked
I will be the first
Well
You are a mess
Im a monster as well as a dwarf You should charge me double
You think Im here for money
That was the arrangement we made I pay you and you lie to me
Oh Im a poor little rich man and nobody loves me so I make jokes all the time and pay them to laugh Fuck your money Lets leave
Leave
Leave Kings Landing They tried to kill you They will try again Going into wars fighting soldiers youre terrible at this Lets take a boat to Pentos and never come back You dont belong here
What would we do in Pentos
Eat drink fuck live
I want to go with you
So do it Your father your sister all these bad people they cant stop you Forget about them Come with me
I cant I do belong here These bad people are what Im good at Outtalking them outthinking them Its what I am And I like it I like it more than anything Ive ever done Are you going to leave
You have a shit memory I am yours and you are mine
In the sight of the Seven I hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity Look upon one another and say the words
Father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger
Father smith warrior mother maiden crone stranger
I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days
I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days
A house of ghosts Khaleesi
Where are the guards
No guards The warlocks kill with sorcery not steel
Let them try
Is this a riddle
Khaleesi Khaleesi
Are you trying to frighten me with magic tricks You want me Here I am Are you afraid of a little girl
How did he find us
What are you doing here
Waiting for you
How did you know wed come this way
After all the things you have seen this is your question
How did you kill those guards Was it hard
No harder than taking a new name if you know the way Show me how I want to be able to do it too
If you would learn you must come with me
Where
Far and away across the Narrow Sea to Braavos
My dancing master was from Braavos
To be a dancing master is a special thing but to be a faceless man that is something else entirely The girl has many names on her lips Joffrey Cersei Tywin Lannister llyn Payne the Hound Names to offer up to the Red God She could offer them all one by one
I want to But I cant I need to find my brother and mother And my sister I need to find her too
Then we must part A man has duties as well Here
What is it
A coin of great value
Could it buy a horse
It is not meant for the buying of horses
Then what good is it
If the day comes when you must find me again just give that coin to any man from Braavos and say these words to him Valar Morghulis
Valar Morghulis
Please dont go Jaqen
Jaqen is dead Say it again Valar Morghulis
Valar Morghulis
Good
Farewell Arya Stark
Osha what are you doing
Tell us what medicine to get from your chambers
Well make you better LUWIN I feel just fine
They burned it down They burned everything
Not everything Not you But they may come back You have to go Put on your warmest clothes Pack as much food as you can carry and go north
Norths the wrong way And mother and brother are south We dont know where
There are too many enemies in the south Go to the Wall to Jon Hell look after you and let your mother know youre safe
I dont want to leave you
No more than I want to leave you I pulled you into the world Both of you Ive seen both your faces almost every day since And for that I consider myself very very lucky Go now with Hodor Go on Ill be right here
Osha You must protect them Youre the only one who can You may have to protect them against your own kind
Ive got no great love for my own kind Ill get you milk of the poppy Tell me where to find it I dont want milk of the poppy
Do it quickly
Moon of my life
This is dark magic like the magic that took you from me Took you from me before I could even Maybe I am dead and I just dont know it yet Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands
Or maybe I refused to enter the Night Lands without you Maybe I told the Great Stallion to go fuck himself and came back here to wait for you
That sounds like something you would do
Or maybe it is a dream Your dream my dream I do not know These are questions for wise men with skinny arms
You are the moon of my life That is all I know and all I need to know
And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me
Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves
They miss their mother
They want to be with you
Do you want to be with them
You will be
When your dragons were born
our magic was born again
It is strongest in their presence
And they are strongest in yours
You will be with them through winter summer winter again Across a thousand thousand seasons you will be with them
And we will be with you until time comes to an end
Welcome home Daenerys Stormborn
This is not my home My home is across the sea where my people are waiting for me
They will be waiting a long time
Dracarys The wildings lead the captive JON and QHORIN on a march playfully tortures JON by batting him with his sword with the RATTLESHIRT walking behind her
We should be there by sundown Wont be a fun night for you Mance knows how to make crows sing If you know what to say you might just make it through the night Not talkings not the way to go
Careful with that You might cut yourself
Never swung a sword before have you You look like a baby with a rattle
Enough of that
Stop
Why traitor So you can give Mance Rayder an invitation to Castle Black
Let em fight
Thats it Thats what you can do You little shit
Your traitor father teach you that
Or was it your whore mother
We are the watchers on the Wall
You can tell Mance thats the man who killed Qhorin Halfhand

Khaleesi

Looks real enough to me Real enough to buy a ship
Aye a small ship
Take all the gold and jewels
I thought we were coming north to fight wildlings
Is this goat
Its moose People shouldnt live anywhere you need to burn shit to keep warm
Well you see a tree let me know
If you step back and think about it the thing about Gilly thats so interesting is
Just bloody kill me
No truly The thing about her that I find so interesting is that after all that Crasters done to her shes still got hope that life might get better
The thing about Gilly that you find so interesting is that she said six words to you
And the thing about you that I find so interesting is absolutely nothing
Its Jon and the Halfhand Theyre back
Two blasts is wildlings Youre not fighting them alone
Come on
Three blasts
Run
Wait Wait for me
Grenn
Edd
Fall back
Brother
Did you send the ravens
Tarly look at me Did you send the ravens
That was your job Your only job We need to get back to the Wall Its a long march We know whats out there but we have to make it have to warn them or before winters done everyone youve ever known will be dead
First time youve seen a giant Jon Snow
Well dont stare too long Theyre shy When they stop being shy they get angry And when theyre angry Ive seen them pound a man straight into the ground like a hammer on a nail
Crow
Crow
Look over there
Crow
Crow Look over here Look
Ah look crow coming
Crow
Youre wearing the wrong color
Mance was a ranger
In your hearts all you crows want to fly free
When Im free will I be free to go
Crow
Crow
Sure you will
Oh
And Ill be free to kill you Got no respect this lot Got no fathers to slap em when theyre foul
What happened to their fathers
Some of them were killed by crows like you Dont look so grim Jon Snow If Mance Rayder likes you youll live another day And if he dont
I smell a crow
We killed his friends Thought youd want to question this one
What do we want with a baby crow
This baby killed Qhorin Halfhand He wants to be one of us
That halfhanded cunt killed friends of mine Friends twice your size
My father told me big men fall just as quick as little ones if you put a sword through their hearts
Plenty of little men tried to put their swords through my heart And theres plenty of little skeletons buried in the woods Whats your name boy
Jon Snow
Your Grace
Your Grace Did you hear that From now on youd better kneel every time I fart
Stand boy We dont kneel for anyone beyond the Wall
So youre Ned Starks bastard Thank you for the gift Lord of Bones You can leave us
The girl likes you You like her back Snow That why you want to join us
Dont panic boy This isnt the damned Nights Watch where we make you swear off girls
This chicken eater you thought was king is Tormund Giantsbane
Cant believe this pup killed the Halfhand
He was our enemy and Im glad hes dead
He was my brother once Back when he had a whole hand What were you doing with him
The Lord Commander sent me to the Halfhand for seasoning
Why
He wants me to lead one day
But here you are a traitor kneeling before the KingbeyondtheWall
If Im a traitor then you are too
Why do you want to join us Jon Snow
I want to be free
No I dont think so I think what you want most of all is to be a hero Ill ask you one last time why do you want to join us
We stopped at Crasters Keep on the way north I saw
You saw what
I saw Craster take his own baby boy and leave it in the woods I saw what took it
Youre telling me you saw one of them And why would that make you desert your brothers
Because when I told the Lord Commander he already knew Thousands of years ago the First Men battled the White Walkers and defeated them I want to fight for the side that fights for the living Did I come to the right place
Well need to find you a new cloak
What if you took off that bit there
Dont you want to leave something to the imagination
Trouble is Ive never had much imagination
I want you to take it off
Mouth
Ser Bronn Ser Bronn
I didnt hear that
Apologies ser
Back away Keep backing away till youre outside this establishment Then back away some more
Lord Tyrion sent me
I will murder you boy
He said it was a matter of life and death
Pod
Its your sister The queen
What are they doing here
Protecting me I assume Will you let me in
No I dont think so
If I wanted to kill you do you think Id let a wooden door stop me
They stay outside
Im not afraid of you little brother
Why are you here
I wanted to see your face They said youd lost your nose but its not as gruesome as all that
The man who cut me lost more than his nose
I should hope so The rebels came for Joffreys head they lost their own Thanks to Father
Thanks to Father Of course it wasnt a rebel who tried to kill me
No Curious Bit of a comedown from chamber of the Hand But then I dont suppose you need much room
Grand Maester Pycelle made the same joke You must be proud to be as funny as a man whose balls brush his knees
Youre meeting Father today
How do you know that
Because I have hundreds of spies in my employ The Master of Whisperers owes me a favor or two Father told me What do you want from him
What do I want from him Hes my father Do I need to want something Im sure he loves me dearly as any father loves his child his baby boy Yet he hasnt come to visit once since arriving in Kings Landing I lay here my face split in half but Father never came
Youre going to make me cry
Why do you care what I want from him
Because youve slandered me to Father before
Slandered When
You told him I had my guards beat that servant girl at Casterly Rock
You did have your guards beat her A girl of nine I believe
I was nine too
She lost an eye if I remember correctly
If I remember correctly she never stole a necklace again
Its not slander if its true
And whats this truth you plan on telling him today
Why are you so nervous about what Im going to say to Father
Because youre a liar I expect youll tell lies about me about Joffrey
Any lies in particular
Youre a clever man but youre not half as clever as you think you are
Still makes me more clever than you
Oh look at these two shining warriors Ser Taryn Mant and Ser Whosit of Whocares
Ser Meryn Trant
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
Youre no knight
Pod
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater was anointed by the king himself
Youre an upjumped cutthroat nothing more
Thats exactly who I am And youre a grub in fancy armor whos better at beating little girls than fighting men Now I have an appointment with Lord Tyrion
You put your hand on that door you lose the hand
As much as I appreciate a walk in the sunshine your lordship I am wondering why you sent for me
A number of people in this city want to kill me Youre here to protect me
Ive been doing that for a while now
Do you grow bored protecting me
I grow poor protecting you
Poor Poor Under my patronage youve become a knight youve served as Commander of the City Watch
Briefly
Im sure you filled your pockets
And now my pockets are empty Youve given me a taste for the finer things And if you want me to carry on protecting you youll need to pay more
I thought we were friends
We are But Im a sellsword I sell my sword I dont loan it out to friends as a favor
How much
Double
Double
Im a knight now Knights are worth double
I dont even know how much Im paying you now
Which means you can afford it
Here Here Help me
Who are you
I was in the battle at Blackwater I was a captain and a knight
Aye ser and serving which king
The one true king of Westeros Stannis Baratheon
I thought you were dead Everyone thought you were dead And your son
He may have swam ashore as you did
No the wildfire took him I saw it
Im so sorry my friend I too have lost a son There is nothing worse in this world But Davos you were a good father
If I was a good father hed still be here Stannis lives
He licks his wounds at Dragonstone
Will you take me there
There is nothing for me at Dragonstone
This war is not over
Not for you maybe But for Salladhor Saan the war is over
Were both sworn to King Stannis
I am sworn to no man I promised you 30 ships and you promised me riches and glory I delivered the ships
Stannis never gives up Never Now he will regroup 
Hes a broken man His fleet lies at the bottom of Blackwater Bay They say he sees no one not his generals not even his wife Only the Red Woman whispering in his ear telling him what she sees in the flames and burning men alive
What
They built a great fire when Stannis returned All those who spoke against her she called servants of darkness They say she sang to them as they burned
Im a pirate
Youre a smuggler
Servants of darkness Im thinking Dragonstone is a good place for us to avoid
Take me back there please
You cannot turn Stannis against her
Maybe not but I could carve her heart out
You could try If you fail they will burn you If you succeed theyll burn you And youve only just come back to life Stay alive a little longer my friend
You call me friend You drank with me on my wedding day
And you drank with me on four of my wedding days but I dont ask you for favors
I have to stop her Please do this for me
When you are dead I will gather your bones in a little sack and let your widow wear them around her neck
We should set the siege lines 1000 yards from Harrenhal
There wont be a siege The Mountain cant defend a ruin
I imagine the Mountain will defend whatever Tywin Lannister tells him to defend
The Lannisters have been running from us since Oxcross Id love a fight The men would love a fight I dont think were going to get one
200 Northmen slaughtered like sheep
The debt will be repaid my friend For them and for your sons
Will it They rot in the ground while their killer runs free
ingslayer wont remain free for long My best hunters are after him
A Mallister
Ser Jeremy My fathers bannerman
Find her a chamber that will serve as a cell
Shes your mother
She freed Jaime Lannister The Lannisters robbed them of their sons and she robbed them of their justice
Water Water
This needs to be cleaned and closed
Whats your name friend
Qyburn
Youre lucky to be alive
Lucky
The badge looks good on you Almost as good as it looked on me Are you enjoying your new position
Am I enjoying it
I was very happy as Hand of the King
Yes I heard how happy you were You brought a whore into my bed
It wasnt your bed at the time
I sent you here to advise the king I gave you real power and authority You chose to spend your days as you always have bedding harlots and drinking with thieves
Occasionally I drank with the harlots
What do you want Tyrion
Why does everyone assume I want something Cant I simply visit with my beloved father My beloved father who somehow forgot to visit his wounded son after he fell on the battlefield
Maester Pycelle assured me your wounds were not fatal
I organized the defense of this city while you held court in the ruins of Harrenhal I led the foray when the enemies were at the gate while your grandson the king quivered in fear behind the walls I bled in the mud for our family And as my reward I was trundled off to some dark little cell But what do I want A little bloody gratitude would be a start
Jugglers and singers require applause You are a Lannister Do you think I demanded a garland of roses every time I suffered a wound on a battlefield Hmm Now I have seven kingdoms to look after and three of them are in open rebellion So tell me what you want
I want what is mine by right Jaime is your eldest son heir to your lands and titles But he is a Kingsguard forbidden from marriage or inheritance The day Jaime put on the white cloak he gave up his claim to Casterly Rock I am your son and lawful heir
You want Casterly Rock
It is mine by right
Well find you accommodations more suited to your name and as a reward for your accomplishments during the battle of Blackwater Bay And when the time is right you will be given a position fit for your talents so that you can serve your family and protect our legacy And if you serve faithfully you will be rewarded with a suitable wife And I would let myself be consumed by maggots before mocking the family name and making you heir to Casterly Rock
Why
Why You ask that You who killed your mother to come into the world You are an illmade spiteful little creature full of envy lust and low cunning Mens laws give you the right to bear my name and display my colors since I cannot prove that you are not mine And to teach me humility the gods have condemned me to watch you waddle about wearing that proud lion that was my fathers sigil and his fathers before him But neither gods nor men will ever compel me to let you turn Casterly Rock into your whorehouse Go now Speak no more of your rights to Casterly Rock Go
Oh one more thing The next whore I catch in your bed Ill hang
Dorne Its going to Dorne
Why Dorne
Its carrying silk and its supposed to bring back wine in exchange But its not coming back The captains tired of risking his life so Kings Landing lords and ladies can get drunk on better wine than they deserve Hes going to stay in Dorne Wait out the winter where its beautiful and warm
I met some people in Dorne who werent so beautiful and warm
Dont ruin the game
I told you I dont want to play
What about that one there
That one Its going to Volantis
Why
Because when I got on a ship in Volantis it looked like that one
Thats not how the game works Youre not supposed to just blurt out the right answer Youve got to invent a story about where the ship is going and why
Why should I make up a story when I know the truth
Because the truth is always either terrible or boring
Lovely day for it Watching the ships
Lord Baelish
Might I speak with Lady Sansa alone for a moment
I saw your mother not long ago Shes very eager to see you And your sister
Aryas alive You said youd take me home
You said Kings Landing was your home You are the property of the crown Stealing you would be treason If you were to tell just one person 
I wont tell anyone
How do I know
Because Im a terrible liar You said so yourself Please Lord Baelish Tell me what to do Tell me when
Im waiting for word on an assignment that will take me far away from the capital When I set sail I might be able to take you with me But youll need to be ready to leave on a moments notice
Youre her handmaiden
Yes And youre his 
I help manage his affairs
Hes an important person
So is she I grew up in the shadow of her fathers castle The day she was born they rang the bells from sunrise till sunset Weve both done rather well you and I
Yes
Given where we started
And where is that
Its not easy for girls like us to dig our way out Watch out for her
I always do
Watch out for her with him
Theyre growing fast
Not fast enough I cant wait that long I need an army
Well be in Astapor by nightfall Some say the Unsullied are the greatest soldiers in the world
The greatest slavesoldiers in the world The distinction means a good deal to some people
Do those people have any better ideas about how to put you on the Iron Throne
Its too beautiful a day to argue
Youre right Another lovely day on the high seas
Dont mock them Theyre the first Dothraki who have ever been on a ship They followed me across the poison water If theyll do it others will And with a true khalasar 
The Dothraki follow strength above all khaleesi Youll have a true khalasar when you prove yourself strong And not before
Your Grace
I heard you were dead
Not yet
I had hoped to speak to you alone Your Grace
We are alone
Your Grace you are the rightful king Not only by blood Youre an honorable man a just man And there is still a war to fight
I am fighting
By burning prisoners alive
How would you punish the infidels Ser Davos
I do not judge people for the gods they worship If I did Id have thrown you in the sea before you ever set foot on Dragonstone
Im not your enemy
You are my enemy
Was it me you fought on Blackwater Bay Did I set your ships ablaze I wasnt there when the wildfire killed our men by the thousands I could have saved those men You would have taken the city Stannis would now sit upon his rightful throne and you would stand beside him But I wasnt there because you convinced your king to leave me behind Do you hear them screaming All those burning men in the water crying for their mothers for their gods for help Until the moment the Blackwater swallowed them
Dont despair Ser Davos What I told your son is true
Death by fire is the purest death
This woman is evil Shes the mother of demons
Take him to the dungeon and lock him in a cell
Your Grace
Come on
Youve chosen the darkness Ser Davos
She will destroy us all
I will pray for you
Your Grace
Halt Down
Halt Down
Why have we stopped
Its Lady Margaery Your Grace
What is she doing Who gave her permission
My lady We should have guards my lady
Why
Pardon me
Stop my lady Youll ruin your dress
I have others
Would you like to speak with her Your Grace
No
He was a soldier He went to fight on the walls when the ships came into Blackwater Bay He never came back
And your mother
She died when she had me
Bad men wanted to come into this city and do terrible things but your father stopped them
Whenever you look at this knight I want you to remember your father
He wasnt a knight He was just a soldier
And what do knights swear to do Protect the weak and uphold the good Your father did that Be proud of him
Was your father a soldier too
You should be proud too Under King Joffreys leadership your fathers saved the city They saved us all From now on were going to take care of you All of you
Come to me for whatever you need to feed them clothe them or house them Directly to me
Your Grace
Your Grace
Please sit Sit I do apologize my lady Small council meetings At what point does it become treason to waste the kings time
Thats a lovely gown my lady
Yes it suits you perfectly I imagine you might be rather cold
The climate is a bit more forgiving back in Highgarden Your Grace
Shall I have them bring you a shawl my lady
I am touched by your concern Your Grace Luckily for us Tyrells our blood runs quite warm Doesnt it Loras
Yes
Loras isnt the queens gown magnificent The fabric the embroidery the metalwork Ive never seen anything like it
You might find a bit of armor quite useful once you become queen Perhaps before Joffrey tells me you stopped your carriage at Flea Bottom on your way back from the sept this morning
Yes I paid a visit to an orphanage the High Septon told me about
Margaery does a great deal of work with the poor back in Highgarden
The lowest among us are no different from the highest if you give them a chance and approach them with an open heart
An open heart is what youll get in Flea Bottom if youre not careful my dear Not long ago we were attacked by a mob there We had a full complement of guards that didnt stop them The king barely escaped with his life
My mothers always had a penchant for drama Facts become less and less important to her as she grows older Our lives were never truly in danger
Youre right of course But you are your fathers son We cant all have a kings bravery
Hunger turns men into beasts Im glad House Tyrell has been able to help in this regard They tell me 100 wagons arrive daily now from the Reach Wheat barley apples Weve had a blessed harvest And of course its our duty to assist the capital in time of need
Well as Ser Loras said Lady Margaery has done this sort of charitable work before Im sure she knows what shes doing
Im sure she does
The path leading to Astapor KRAZNYS MO
The Unsullied have stood here for a day and a night with no food or water
They will stand until they drop
Such is their obedience
They may suit my needs Tell me of their training
The Westrosi woman is pleased with them but speaks no praise to keep the price down She wished to know how they are trained
Tell her what she would know and be quick about it
They begin their training at five Every day they drill from dawn to dusk until they have mastered the shortsword the shield and the three spears Only one boy in four survives this rigorous training
Their discipline and loyalty are absolute They fear nothing
Even the bravest men fear death
The knight says even brave men fear death
Tell the old man he smells of piss
Truly master
No not truly Are you a girl or a goat to ask such a thing
My master says the Unsullied are not men Death means nothing to them
Tell this ignorant whore of a Westerner to open her eyes and watch
He begs you attend to this carefully Your Grace
Tell the good master there is no need
Shes worried about their nipples Doers the dumb bitch know weve cut off their balls
My master points out that men dont need nipples
Here Im done with you
This one is pleased to have served you
To win his shield an Unsullied must go to the slave marts with a silver mark find a newborn and kill it before its mothers eyes This way my master says we make certain there is no weakness left in them
You take a babe from its mothers arms kill it as she watches and pay for her pain with a silver coin
She is offended She asks if you pay a sliver coin to the mother for her dead baby
What a soft mewling fool this one is
My master would like you to know that the silver is paid to the babys owner not the mother
How many do you have to sell
8000 KRAZNYS MO
Tell the Westerosi whore she has until tomorrow
Master Kraznys asks that you please hurry Many other buyers are interested
8000 dead babies
The Unsullied are a means to an end
Once I own them these men 
Theyre not men Not anymore
Once I own an army of slaves what will I be
Do you think these slaves will have better lives serving Kraznys and men like him or serving you
Youll be fair to them You wont mutilate them to make a point
You wont order them to murder babies Youll see theyre properly fed and sheltered A great injustice has been done to them Closing your eyes will not undo it
The warlocks
I owe you my life ser
The honor is mine my queen
You know this man
I know him as one of the greatest fighters the Seven Kingdoms has ever seen and as the Lord Commander of Robert Baratheons Kingsguard
Dont think too much Bran
Relax your bow arm
And which one of you was a marksman at 10
Father
You cant kill it you know
Why not
Because the raven is you
Hodor
Its all right Hodor
Hodor
Were you inside the wolf again little lord
No it was the threeeyed raven
Hes back
I tried to kill it but I couldnt There was a boy
I dont want to hear about it
But you asked
Weve got plenty of worries We dont need to pour black magic on top of them
I didnt ask for black magic dreams
I know you didnt little lord
We need to move
We dont know who might be after us No one even knows were alive
And who told you that The threeeyed raven tell you
No
Some good he is then
I dont know what other people know and what they dont I only know the Wall is a long way off
My mother always told me you Westerosi were a grim lot Grim bearded stinking barbarians that would row across the Narrow Sea and steal us from our beds
Did you ever think youd marry one
I never thought Id marry anyone at all
Never
Not until I met the king of the grim bearded stinking barbarians
Pardon me Your Grace My queen
Lord Bolton
Let me guess which one is the good news
Word from Riverrun and Winterfell
I hadnt seen him in years I dont even know how many
Well travel to the funeral together Lord Bolton will garrison here until we return
Will I be wearing manacles when I lay my father to rest
Something else
By the time Boltons bastardRAMSAY got to Winterfell the ironborn were gone They massacred everyone and put the castle to the torch And BRAN and RICKON have not been found They may have escaped Or Theon may have taken them back to the Iron Islands as hostages
Have you received any demands
No
Have you heard anything from Theon at all
Where am I Who are you What do you want
I want to do this
Do you know how long its going to take us to get to Kings Landing walking through fields and forests
Yes
So how shall we pass the time
By putting one foot in front of the other
Its going to be a very dull walk
Im here to take you to Kings Landing and bring back Lady Starks daughters in exchange Dull is fine
You know it doesnt matter how loyal a servant you are no one enjoys the company of a humorless mute Trust me on this People have been serving me since I was born You think Lady Stark is going to want a giant towheaded plank following her around for the rest of her life A weeks journey with you and shell order you to fall on your sword
If Lady Stark is unhappy with any aspect of my service Im sure shell let me know Shes an honest woman
All the good its done her
How did you come into Lady Starks service Theres something we can talk about
Not your concern Kingslayer
It had to be recently You werent with her at Winterfell
How would you know
Because I visited Winterfell I would have noticed your dour head smacking into the archways
Move
Were you pledged to Stannis
Gods no
Ah Renly Really He wasnt fit to rule over anything more important than a 12course meal
Shut your mouth
Why I lived with him at court since he was a boy dont forget Could hardly escape the little tulip Skipping down the corridors in his embroidered silks I knew him far better than you
I knew him as well as anyone As a member of his Kingsguard he trusted me with everything He would have been a wonderful king
Sounds like you quite fancied him
I did not fancy him
Oh gods you did
Did you ever tell him No of course not You werent Renlys type Im afraid
He preferred curlyhaired little girls like Loras Tyrell Youre far too much man for him
Im not interested in foul rumors
Unless theyre about me Its all true about Renly His proclivities were the worst kept secret at court Its a shame the throne isnt made out of cocks Theyd have never got him off it
Shut your mouth
I dont blame him And I dont blame you either We dont get to choose who we love
Where are you headed then
South You
Riverrun Staying off the kingsroad are you They get you no matter where you go You cant win
No you really cant
Looks like youre safe enough though Meaning no offense my lady but I wouldnt tangle with you Seven blessings to you
And you
He knows who I am
He doesnt
Maybe youre right But what if youre not What if he tells someone
Were not doing it Hes an innocent man
More innocent than Lady Starks daughters
Make it tighter here
Thats better It makes you look very strong
No flowers I said no flowers All these are wrong Bring others
Yes Your Grace
Bloody flowers On the king
Looks like a Tyrell rose Give it to Margaery for her wedding gown Should be more than enough fabric
Tell me what you think of her
Who
Margaery
Shes an ideal match With the Tyrells beside us well crush the Northerners Hang their lords burn their strongholds sow their fields with salt and no one will think of rebelling for another century
It is a good match but what do you think of her Shes beautiful and intelligent
Yes she is
Her concern with the wellbeing of the common people is interesting
Not to me
I only meant that to go out of your way to endanger yourself
This is becoming one of the most boring conversations Ive ever had
Margaery Tyrell dotes on filthy urchins for a reason She dresses like a harlot for a reason She married a traitor and known degenerate like Renly Baratheon for a reason
She married Renly Baratheon because she was told to Thats what intelligent women dowhat theyre told
You need to ask yourself
I dont need to do anything
Better Much better
I still dont believe it
He didnt He didnt want anything He just takes an interest because he loved my mother
Men only want one thing from a pretty girl
Littlefingers not in love with me
Love is not the thing he wants
Hes too old
They never see it that way He didnt ask you to do something for him Spy on someone or
No
If he does ask you for anything or try anything or touch you I want you to tell me
Why What will you do I will make him stop
Ser Loras Tyrell my lady
Send him in
Lady Sansa
Ser Loras
My sister Margaery invites you to take the air with her and our grandmother the Lady Olenna in the gardens May I escort you to them
I believe you grow more beautiful every day Lady Sansa
You are too kind Ser Loras You probably dont remember the first time we met At the Hands tourney you gave me your favor A rose a red rose
Of course I did
Its more your color You take it
Thank you
Youre such a dear
Ill take my leave Lady Sansa
Thank you Ser Loras
Come Lady Sansa it is my honor to present my grandmother the Lady Olenna of House Tyrell
Kiss me child
Its so good of you to visit me and my foolish flock of hens Were very sorry for your losses
And I was sorry when I heard of Lord Renlys death Lady Margaery He was very gallant
Gallant yes And charming and very clean He knew how to dress and smile and somehow this gave him the notion he was fit to be king
Renly was brave and gentle Grandmother Father liked him and so did Loras
Loras is young and very good at knocking men off horses with a stick That does not make him wise As to your fathead father
Grandmother What will Sansa think of us
She might think we have some wits about us One of us at any rate It was treason I warned them Robert has two sons and Renly has an older brother How could he possibly have any claim to that ugly iron chair We should have stayed well out of all this if you ask me But once the cows been milked theres no squirting the cream back up her udders So here we are to see things through What do you say to that Sansa Shall we have some lemon cakes
Lemon cakes my favorite
So weve been told Are you going to bring the food or do you mean to starve us to death Here Sansa come sit with me Im much less boring than these others
Do you know my son The Lord of Highgarden
I havent had the pleasure
No great pleasure believe me A ponderous oaf His father was an oaf as well My husband the late Lord Luthor He managed to ride off a cliff whilst hawking They say he was looking up at the sky and paying no mind to where his horse was taking him And now my son is doing the same only this time hes riding a lion instead of a horse Now I want you to tell me the truth about this royal boy this Joffrey
I  I
You you Who else would know better Weve heard some troubling tales Is there any truth to them Has this boy mistreated you
Has he ripped out your tongue
JoffKing Joffrey heHis Grace is very fair and handsome and as brave as a lion
Yes all Lannisters are lions And when a Tyrell farts it smells like a rose But how kind is he How clever Has he a good heart a gentle hand
Im to be his wife I only want to know what that means
Bring me some cheese
The cheese will be served after the cakes my lady
The cheese will be served when I want it served And I want it served now
Are you frightened child No need for that Were only women here Tell us the truth No harm will come to you
My father always told the truth
Yes he had that reputation And they named him traitor and took his head
Joffrey Joffrey did that He promised he would be merciful and he cut my fathers head off And he said that was mercy Then he took me up on the walls and made me look at it
Go on
II cant I never meantmy father was a traitor My brother as well I have traitors blood Please dont make me say anymore
Shes terrified Grandmother Just look at her
Speak freely child We would never betray your confidence I swear it
Hes a monster
Ah Thats a pity
Please dont stop the wedding
Have no fear The Lord Oaf of Highgarden is determined that Margaery shall be queen Even so we thank you for the truth Ah here comes my cheese
Were at war This march is a distraction
My grandfathers funeral is not a distraction
Are we riding to battle at Riverrun
No
Then its a distraction
My Uncle Edmure has his forces garrisoned there We need his men
Unless hes been breeding them he dont have enough to make a difference
Have you lost faith in our cause
If its revenge I still got faith in it
If you no longer believe
I can believe till it snows in Dorne Dont change the fact that weve got half the men
You dont think we can win
May I speak my mind Your Grace
Have you not been speaking your mind Lord Karstark
I think you lost this war the day you married her
Whoa whoa
Your Grace
Youre afraid of her And she knows it
Im not afraid of her May I help you Lady Stark
No
Im sorry I shouldnt have
You cant help because a mother makes one for her children to protect them Only a mother can make them
Youve made them before
Twice
Did they work
After a fashion I prayed for my son Bran to survive his fall
Many years before that one of the boys came down with the pox Maester Luwin said if he made it through the night hed live But it would be a very long night So I sat with him all through the darkness Listened to his ragged little breaths his coughing his whimpering
Which boy
Jon Snow When my husband brought that baby home from the war I couldnt bear to look at him I didnt want to see those brown strangers eyes staring up at me So I prayed to the gods take him away Make him die He got the pox And I knew I was the worst woman who ever lived A murderer Id condemned this poor innocent child to a horrible death all because I was jealous of his mother A woman he didnt even know So I prayed to all seven gods let the boy live Let him live and Ill love him Ill be a mother to him Ill beg my husband to give him a true name to call him Stark and be done with it to make him one of us
And he lived
And he lived And I couldnt keep my promise And everything thats happened since then all this horror thats come to my family its all because I couldnt love a motherless child
Was it hard for you to kill the Halfhand
Yes
You liked him I like you but if youre playing us false it wont be hard for me to kill you Ive got wildling blood in my veins These are my people
I understand
Well how could you understand
You want to protect your people
Do you know what it takes to unite 90 clans half of whom want to massacre the other half for one insult or another They speak seven different languages in my army The Thenns hate the Hornfoots The Hornfoots hate the iceriver clans Everyone hates the cave people So you know how I got moon worshippers and cannibals and giants to march together in the same army
No
I told them we were all going to die if we dont get south Because thats the truth
Shouldnt be long now
Whats wrong with him
Hes a warg He can enter the mind of animals see through their eyes Hes scouting for us
What youve never met a warg
Orell
Where were you this time
The Fist of the First Men
What did you see
Dead crows
Whats the matter Piggy You crying cause youre cold Theres 200 brothers killed by dead men and youre still here whimpering That seem fair to you I seen em torn to pieces fighting while you was off somewhere hiding in a hole Why dont you lie down and rest for a while eh You know you want to
Hey Get up Sam
No
Get up
I cant
If you stop youll die
Course if you dont stop youll probably die too
You dont care
Course we care
You left me When the white walkers came you left me
Aye we left you Youre fat and youre slow We didnt want to die
Help me get him up
Looks like that piggy is done for
Help us get him up
Hes slowing us down
Just get him up
Why So the rest of us can die Well move faster without him
What is this Get up Tarly Is he all right
Aye I think so
If he cant we may as well just go without him
Thats enough Tarly I forbid you to die Do you hear me
Why should the rest of us
Rast youre responsible for him
What am I supposed to do
Make sure he gets back alive If he doesnt you dont Move on
Im not dying for you Piggy You hear me
Wheres Rickon and Hodor
Looking for food
Whats out there
Not another step boy Unless you want to drown in your own blood
Im unarmed
That was poor planning
My sister carries the weapons
Im better with them Drop the spear
Drop it
If you kill me that wolf will tear you to bits
You must be Summer
Im Jojen Reed This is my sister Meera Weve come a long way to find you Brandon And we have much farther to go
Im just trying to understand
Would you please shut up about it
Jaqen Hghar offered you three kills
Im not listening
But just explain it to me He offered to kill any three people you wanted Dead All you had to do was give him the names Anyone You could have picked King Joffrey
Shut up
You could have picked Tywin Lannister
Jaqen got us out of Harrenhal so why are you complaining
But you could have ended the war
Where are we going
North
If we were going north we should have come to the Red Fork River by now
Maybe we already passed it
Its 100 feet wide How could we have passed it If we hit the Red Fork we can follow it west to Riverrun My mother grew up there My grandfather hes a lord Hell protect us
Could be a minstrel
Shut up
A lion still has claws HOT
A minstrels got gold sometimes We could jump him tie him up steal his gold and buy some food
Shh
And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere But now the rains Weep oer his hall With no one there to hear
Whats lurking behind that wall A lion A wolf
Just a dirty little cub I think
Loose a few more shafts
Dont
Put the sword down girl
You go on down the road Just keep on singing so we know where you are Leave us be and I wont kill you
Generous
Youre a dangerous person I like dangerous people Why are your friends so shy
What friends
The fat to your left and the lad beside him
Three young ones on the run carrying castleforged swords You escape from Harrenhal
Who are you
Thoros of Myr And the fellow here with the bow is Anguy
No who do you fight for
The Brotherhood without Banners Now come along I want to hear how two boys and a very dangerous girl escaped Harrenhal
Im not going with them The Brotherhood Thats who the Mountain and them lot were looking for Theyll bring us back and put rats in us
Youve got nothing to fear from us son The lords of Westeros want to burn the countryside Were trying to save it Now come on Well talk some more over brown bread and stew And then you can go on your way
Heres the thing
When Im done talking that arrows falling down on your fat head So I advise you move because Im done talking
Half the countrys starving and look at this one
Maybe hes the reason half the countrys starving
My lion
Weve spoken of this You cannot come here
But you said I should come to you with any problems
Did anyone see you No
No
You sure My father does not make idle threats Having you killed would be the high point of his week You have to be absolutely certain
All right What is this problem
Im worried about Sansa When she spoke with Lord Baelish his friend warned me about him
Baelish doesnt have friends
I dont know her name
Oh Ros The redhead
How do you know her
I try to know as many people as I can You never know which one youll need
Shes a whore
Yes well we shouldnt be judgmental about these things
You fucked her
Oh please All right yes I fucked her once Twice
But since I met you my lady Ive been with no one else
And was she good Did you like her
Not as much as I like you obviously or shed be the one torturing me right now What did she say about Littlefinger
That Sansa shouldnt trust him
Is there an idiot in any village who trusts Littlefinger
We have to protect her
We cant Now that the Lannisters have discarded her Sansa will have many suitors A great beauty with a very old name
A great beauty Oh a great beauty
Yes she is objectively very Her face is quite pleasingto other men and to women people in general But not to me of course I only have eyes for you
You pervert You want her This child
I dont even want to talk about her
But you are
Only because youre making me
I didnt force you to open your mouth and make words come out
This is cruel and unfair Cruelly unfair
Oh the cruelty Shae is so cruel to me
Hmm yes
Now do you think Im cruel
Only if you stop But you mustnt come here again
Do you hear me Youve come to a dangerous place full of dangerous people Dangerous people
Lady Tyrell my king
Send her in
You wanted to see me Your Grace
Im leaving on a hunting trip I just wanted to make sure you had everything you need before I left
Thats very thoughtful Your Grace I have everything I could want
Good Good How are you finding life in the capital It must be quite a change after Renlys camp
A welcome one A military encampment is no place for a lady
And the bedside of a traitor Is that a place for a lady
Your Grace I tried to do my duty as a wife that is all
What was your duty to this traitor as you saw it
The duty of any wife to any husbandto provide him with children
You failed to do this
Why II would not speak ill of the dead Your Grace
You think one ought to speak kindly of a traitor merely because hes had a sword put through his heart
No I do beg your pardon The subtleties of politics are often lost on me Renly I dont believe he was interested in the company of women
What makes you say this
Whenever I wanted to make a child with him hehe had so many excuses so many latenight war councils He never wanted to try Except one evening after hed had far too much wine to drink he suggested somethingsomething that sounded very painful and couldnt possibly result in children Maybe the fault was with me
No he was a known degenerate
Its such a relief to hear you say so Your Grace
Mmm Ive considered making his perversion punishable by death
As is your right You must do whatever you need to do
You are the king
Yes I am
Do you like it I just had it made Probably one of the finest weapons in the Seven Kingdoms
Its beautiful Will you show me how it works
Its a new design Much easier to load Theres no crank You use this lever to draw the string
The bolt goes here
And then you just aim and
Would you take me hunting sometime Forgive me Your Grace I know a hunt is no place for a woman
Its not unheard of
My father would never let me before
You no longer belong to him Do you want to hold it
May I Please
I imagine it must be so exciting to squeeze your finger here and watch something die over there
Could you do it Could you kill something
I dont know Your Grace Do you think I could
Yes
Would you like to watch me
Yes
Stop Stop
Tell us the truth
About what
I dont know what you want
I want the truth
What truth
Whyd you take Winterfell
I took it toI took it
Who gave the orders
No one I took it on my own
Why
To take the North while it was vulnerable
What were you going to do once you took it
Hold it Rule it
Good Thats very good
Why did you do that
I told you Why did you take Winterfell
I took it to bring glory to my house and my father
Wait Wait wait wait I took it because I hated the Starks I hated them for holding me prisoner I wanted to hurt them
What are you doing
Please
Ill tell you anything Just take it off Please Please just take it off
Your sister sent me
Yara
Ill come for you tonight when the castle sleeps
No dont go Please please No please dont leave me Please please Please please dont go Please Please Dont leave me Please dont go
Rickon stay with us
Its all right The wolves will protect him
You can get inside his head see through his eyes
Only when Im asleep
Thats how it begins until you learn to control it Youre a warg
Its not just wolves Sometimes in my dreams theres a
A threeeyed raven
Youve seen it
We saw him together You havent forgotten
Does it have anything to do with warging
No the raven is something different something deeper The raven brings the sight
Seeing things that havent happened yet
Or things that happened long before you were born or things that are happening right now thousands of miles away
Whats he telling him
Why dont you ask
Isnt he ashamed your brother needing you to protect him
Wheres the shame in that
Any boy his age who needs his sister to protect him is gonna find himself needing lots of protecting
Some people will always need help That doesnt mean theyre not worth helping
When my father died I dreamt it
You didnt dream it You saw it So did I
You have the sight too
When I told my father about your father for the first time in my life I saw him cry
Your father is Howland Reed Yeah
Yeah
He saved my fathers life during the rebellion
Your father told you about the rebellion Mine never did But I saw that too
What else have you seen
Only one thing that mattersyou
I never liked the skinny ones Like drinking from a puddle Not that Im averse to drinking from a puddle every now and again you understand
I dont drink ale
Theres no story so good a drink wont make it better
Yeah
You see Theyve all suffered through my bouts of sobriety Its very tedious for all concerned Now how did three children
Were not children
How did three young persons such as yourselves untrained in the art of war escape from Harrenhal
Gendrys a smith He was apprenticed in the armory
A smith eh Whered you train
Kings Landing Tobho Motts shop
That criminal He charges twice as much as every other armorer in the city
Thats because hes twice as good
Aha A smith and a salesman
Gendry stole us weapons
Ah fought your way out of Harrenhal I see
He knows how to use a sword and so do I
My brothers taught me
Ooh
To your brothers
You can finish your meals before you go It may be awhile before you see another
Youll free us
I gave you my word But before you go allow me to raise a cup to your
Hey hey
Now that is an uncommonly large person How does one manage to subdue such an uncommonly large person
One waits for him to drink until he passes out
Poor man You have my sympathy
Aha not a man at all A Hound
So good to see you again Clegane
Thoros The fuck you doing here
Drinking and talking too much Same as ever
A pretty prize lads
Yeah
Girl
What in seven hells are you doing with the Stark bitch
Its a tough decisiontake the bridge and risk being seen or cross the great water
Silence Kingslayer
Anyone can see us on the bridge but cross by water and the current could take us or I could escape down the river
Good luck
Its wonderful to watch you wrestle with these dilemmas Which will she choose
Gambler at heart Wouldnt have guessed
Be quick about it
I need to rest
Get up
I have these you know on your feet when you walk too far What do you call them
Get up now
Corns I never used to get corns Of course I used to ride everywhere not march around like a common foot soldier wearing the same shit boots for over a year
This heel is ruined Theres no way
I never understood why some knights felt the need to carry two swords
Ooh You move well for a great beast of a woman
You shouldnt grimace before you lunge It gives away the game
Bit of a quandary for you If you kill me you fail Lady Stark But if you dont kill me Im going to kill you
Youre good Graceless but good
See If you were willing to hurt me you might have had me there
Looks like your womans getting the better of you if you can call that a woman
We enjoy a good fight Gets our juices flowing The Flayed Man of House Bolton A bit gruesome for my taste
You sure hes the one
Thats him all right I saw him fight at the tourney for Ser Willem Freys wedding
Give the man his silver
Let us go and my father will pay you whatever you want
If I may nephew I encountered a situation with one of my lieutenants at the Stone Mill which may have some bearing
Why dont you shut your mouth about that damned mill And dont call him nephew He is your king
Robb knows I meant him no disr
Youre lucky Im not your king I wouldnt let you wave your blunders around like a victory flag
My blunder sent Tywins mad scurrying back to Casterly Rock with his tail between his legs I think King Robb understands were not gonna win this war if hes the only one winning any battles No theres glory enough to go around
Its not about glory Your instructions were to wait for him to come to you
I seized an opportunity
What value was the mill
The Mountain was garrisoned across the river from it
Is he there now Of course not
We took the fight to him He could not withstand us
I wanted to draw the Mountain into the west into our country where we could surround him and kill him I wanted him to chase us which he would have done because he is a mad without a strategic thought in his head I could have that head on a spike by now Instead I have a mill
We took hostages Willem Lannister Martyn Lannister
Willem and Martyn Lannister are 14 years old
Martyn is 15 I believe
Tywin Lannister has my sisters Have I sued for peace
No
Do you think hell sue for peace because we have his fathers brothers greatgrandsons
No
How many men did you lose
But for every man we lost the Lannisters
We need our men more than Tywin needs his
Im sorry I didnt know
You would have Right here today at this gathering if you had been patient
We seem to be running short of patience here
You know who isnt Tywin Lannister TYWIN stands by the head of the table PYCELLE VARYS and LITTLEFINGER enter silently enters next TYWIN sits then PYCELLE VARYS and LITTLEFINGER join him remains still while CERSEI enters and surveys the room She pauses then walks to the table She picks up one of the two remaining empty chairs and places it directly next to TYWIN then sits while the others smirk comes forward and drags the final chair noisily to the opposite head of the table
Intimate Lovely table Better chairs than the old small council chamber Conveniently close to your own quarters I like it
What news of Jaime
20000 unwashed northerns have known about his escape for weeks Collectively you control more spies and informants than the rest of the world combined Do you mean to tell me that none of you has any notion of where he is
We are trying my lord
Try harder What do we have then
Robb Stark and most of his bannermen are in Riverrun for the funeral of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully In Starks absence Roose Bolton holds Harrenhal which would seem to make him Lord of Harrenhal in practice if not in name
Well let him have it The name suits our purposes far more than that useless pile of rubble The Lord of Harrenhal will make a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn
For which I am extremely grateful to you my lord Lady Arryn and I have known each other since we were children She has always been positively predisposed toward me
A successful courtship would make Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale
Titles do seem to breed titles
Youll leave for the Eyrie as soon as possible and bring Lysa Arryn into the fold Then the young wolf can add his own aunt to the list of people who have taken up arms against him
Far be it from me to hinder true love but Lord Baelishs absence would present certain problems The royal wedding may end up being the most expensive event in living memory Summer has ended hard days lie ahead Not a good time to leave the crowns finances unattended
Fully agreed Which is why Im naming you new Master of Coin
Master of Coin
It would appear to be a position that best suits your talents
Im quite good at spending money but a lifetime of outrageous wealth hasnt taught me much about managing it
I have no doubt you will prove equal to this challenge
Hear hear
He lifted her high in the air He sniffed and roared and smelled her there She kicked and wailed a maid so fair But he licked the honey from her hair From there to here from here to there All black and brown and covered with hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear the bear and the maiden fair
I hope youre pleased If you had armed me they never would have taken us
You were armed when we were taken
I was in chains if you recall Our little match would have ended quite quick if my hands werent bound
All my life Ive been hearing Jaime Lannister what a brilliant swordsman You were slower than I expected And more predictable
Ive been sitting in a muddy pen wrapped in chains for the past year
And Im a woman I was still beating you
You were not beating me
Maybe you were as good as people said once Or maybe people just love to overpraise a famous name
When we make camp tonight youll be raped More than once None of these fellows have ever been with a noblewoman Youd be wise not to resist
Would I
Theyll knock your teeth out
You think I care about my teeth
No I dont think you care about your teeth If you fight them they will kill you Do you understand Im the prisoner of value not you Let them have what they want What does it matter
What does it matter
Close your eyes Pretend theyre Renly
If you were a woman you wouldnt resist Youd let them do what they wanted
If I was a woman Id make them kill me But Im not thank the gods
If I had a proper forge I could make it good as new
Doesnt have to look pretty It just has to keep the arrows out of my heart
Why are you helping him He takes us prisoner and now hes our friend
Youre not our prisoner little lady
What am I
Our guest No ones put any chains on you
So I can walk away then
These woods arent safe for Ned Starks daughter oure lucky we found you
You think youre good with that bow you little twat
Better than anyone youve ever met
A cowards weapon I like to fight up close I like to see a mans face when I put the steel in him
Why So you can kiss him
You remember the last time you were here
Looks like every other shit inn on the road
Now apologies but youre one ugly fucker and Id rather not see you no more
Watch your head Off we go
Walk up
What are you doing Were about to leave
Im staying
Youre what
I baked some brown bread for the innkeep and she said she never had better Told Thoros shes keeping me as a payment for all the free meals shes given him Anyway its not me the Brotherhood wants My brother aint no king Im not a Stark of Winterhell
Winterfell
You sure
Im sure
Well I made you something
What is it
Its a wolf
Yes it is
Thats the tail
Yeah
Well be safe
Yeah you too Dont get stabbed
You dont burn your fingers
Goodbye Hot Pie
Goodbye Arry
Up you go little lady
Hey Hot Pie Its really good
A person could almost be forgiven for forgetting were at war
It often comforts me to think that even in wars darkest days in most places in the world absolutely nothing is happening
Ive missed you Uncle Father missed you too from the day you left Maybe he never said it in so many words
Maybe Your father was a stubborn old ox I was surprised when he died Didnt think death had the patience
Im glad you were with him I wish to the gods I had been Did you make peace in the end
After 30 years of fighting I dont think he remembered what started it He asked me to stop calling myself Blackfish He said it was an old joke and it was never funny to begin with I told him people had been calling me Blackfish for so long they dont remember my real name
Every time he would leave for the capital or fight in a campaign Id see him off Wait for me little Cat hed say Wait for me and Ill come back to you And I would sit at this window every day when the sun came up waiting I wonder how many times did Bran or Rickon stare across the moors of Winterfell waiting for me to return I will never see them again
You mustnt think it We dont know the truth They could be in hiding Robb believes theyre alive And he must go on believing Hes got to remain strong if hes to prevail And you must remain strong for him
Youre Robb Starks wife
Hold still
Is it true what they say about him
I dont know What do they say about him
That he can turn into a wolf at night
TRUE
And he eats the flesh of his enemies
True Youre a Lannister arent you
Martyn Lannister
Martyn Lannister Youve nothing to fear My husband doesnt eat children Unless its a full moon Its not a full moon tonight is it See Nothing to fear
Always the artists
Its only horses No men
You said there was dead crows
There was
How many men were here
About 300
And you know what those men are now
Were all the same to them meat for their army
Do you think anyone got away
Its not impossible You dont go far betting against Mormont But dead or alive he took a big gamble coming north And he lost His best fighting men are dead And whether hes Lord Commander of the Nights Watch or a blueeyed corpse hes a long way from home Tormund Climb the Wall Take Orell and 20 good men And take this one He knows Castle Blacks defenses better than any of us And if hes useful good If not throw him off the Wall See if crows can fly
Were finally going to war old friend
Hide near Castle Black When I give the signal hit them in the night Theyve got a big old wall to hide behind but it only guards one side
Well meet again
Aye If you do your job Ah
How will we see your signal
Send your eagle above the Wall every night When its time Im going to light the biggest fire the North has ever seen
Ghost
What have we here Frozen crows
Weve come a long way
Smaller flock than you went north with
We can talk inside
Oh can we
They need some water
Tether it and Ill be inside
Keep your eyes where they belong Theyre not for you
Bet you feed that pig better than you feed us
Aye pigs got value to me You should all be kissing my feet for letting you in Id have turned you all away if I wasnt a godly man
You are a godly man
I am I got no fear of whats out there When the white cold comes your swords and cloaks and bloody fires wont help you The only ones left will be those who are right with the gods The real gods
Go tell her she can bite down on a rag or she can bite down on my fist Women That sow right there gave birth to a litter of eight Barely a grunt And shes almost as fat as this one here Now why dont you dine on him Carve off what you need as you go Well look at him Hes a walking feast
Here we are
Sharpen these for me would ya
I see the head Push
Thats it Youre nearly there One more push should do it
What is it What is it
Keep quiet
If you cant ride we dont stand a chance
I can ride
Youre sure
Ride east Follow the rising sun Your sisters waiting for you
Ill make you a Lord of the Iron Islands for this
Were not in the Iron Islands Go
Come on Come on Come on Come on Come on
Come on back
You refuse to tell me where youre going
I dont know yet The fires will show me
How long will you be gone
I dont know
Youre abandoning me
I will never abandon you You are the Son of Fire I am sworn to serve you
Then serve me
When I return you will understand
My enemies think theyve destroyed me Theyre laughing at me the way Renly laughed at me I want Joffrey dead I want Robb Stark dead Make me another son
I cannot
Why
You dont have the strength It would kill you
Im not so easily killed Men have been trying for years
I want you
Your fires burn low my king
There is another way A better way
You told me your magic requires a kings blood
Yes
Im the one true king
You are But there are others with your blood in their veins You will sit on the Iron Throne but first there must be sacrifices The Lord of Light demands it
The Walk of Punishment is a warning Your Grace
To whom
To any slave who contemplates doing whatever these slaves did
Give me your water
Khaleesi this man has been sentenced to death
Here drink
Leave this place Your Grace Leave tonight I beg you
And what is she to do for soldiers
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr
Is it we already Ser Barristan If you want to sit on the throne your ancestors built you must win it That will mean blood on your hands before the thing is done
The blood of my enemies not the blood of innocents
How many wars have you fought in Ser Barristan
Three
Have you ever seen a war where innocents didnt die by the thousands
I was in Kings Landing after the sack khaleesi You know what I saw Butchery Babies children old men More women raped than you can count Theres a beast in every man and it stirs when you put a sword in his hand But the Unsullied are not men They do not rape They do not put cities to the sword unless theyre ordered to do so If you buy them the only men theyll kill are those you want dead
Do you disagree Ser Barristan
When your brother Rhaegar led his army into battle at the Trident men died for him because they believed in him because they loved him not because theyd been bought at a slavers auction I fought beside the last dragon on that day Your Grace I bled beside him
Rhaegar fought valiantly Rhaegar fought nobly and Rhaegar died
Did you know him well Ser Barristan
I did Your Grace Finest man I ever met
I wish I had known him But he was not the last dragon
All Did this ones ears mishear Your Grace
They did not I want to buy them all
She wants to buy them all
She cant afford them The slut thinks that she can flash her tits and make us give her whatever she wants
There are 8000 Unsullied in Astapor Is this what you mean by all
Yes 8000 And the ones still in training as well
If they fail on the battlefield they will shape Astapor
Master Greizhen says they cannot sell halftrained boys If they fail on the battlefield they will bring shame upon all of Astapor
I will have them all or take none Many will fall in battle Ill need the boys to pick up the swords they drop
The slut cannot pay for all of this
Master Kraznys says you cannot afford this
Her ship will buy her 100 Unsullied no more
Your ship will buy you Because Master Kraznys is generous
And this is because I like the curve of her ass
The gold you have left is worth 10
What is left will buy her 10 I will give her 20 if it stops her ignorant whimpering
But good Master Kraznys will give you 20
Her Dothraki smell of shit but will be useful as pig feed
The Dothraki you have with you
I will give her 3 for those
The Dothraki you have are not worth what they cost to feed but Master Kraznys will give you three Unsullied for all of them
So ask this beggar queen how will she pay for the remaining 7877
Master Kraznys asks how you propose to pay for the remaining 7877 unsullied
I have dragons Ill give you one
You will win the throne with dragons not slaves Your Grace
Khaleesi please
Three dragons
One
Two
One
They want the biggest one
Done
Done
Ill take you as well now Youll be Master Kraznys gift to me A token of a bargain well struck
She asks that you give me to her as a present She asks that you do this now
Khaleesi a dragon is worth more than any army
Aegon Targaryen proved that
Youre both here to advise me I value your advice but if you ever question me in front of strangers again youll be advising someone else Is that understood
Do you have a name
This ones name is Missandei Your Grace
Do you have a family A mother and a father youd return to if you had the choice
No Your Grace No family living
You belong to me now It is your duty to tell me the truth
Yes Your Grace Lying is a great offense Many of those on the Walk of Punishment were taken there for less
I offered water to one of the slaves dying on the Walk of Punishment Do you know what he said to me Let me die
There are no masters in the grave Your Grace
Is it true what Master Kraznys told me about the Unsullied About their obedience
All questions have been taken from them They obey that is all Once they are yours they are yours They will fall on their swords if you command it
And what about you You know that Im taking you to war You may go hungry You may fall sick You may be killed
Valar morghulis
Yes all men must die But we are not men
A surprising place to keep the royal ledgers
Im surprised youre surprised This is the safest place in the city
Not for bastards
Thats all of them my lord
Thank you my dear
Pod Pod Take them outside Ill be there in a moment
Yes my lord
I hear you owe that boy a significant debt
Only my life Not all that significant Im afraid
You should have him knighted
If only the Master of Coin had such power
If only I owe you a significant debt Our redheaded friend You secured her release when the queen detained her
Oh that Of course A simple misunderstanding
Apparently Her Grace believed that you two had some sort of special relationship
We dont I did fuck her once
I know
But we dont
I know But how would the queen get that idea
Why dont you ask her Any advice for me on my new position
Keep a low profile
If I had a gold dragon for every time I heard that joke Id be richer than you are
Well you are richer than I am
Good point
Theyre only numbers Numbers on paper Once you understand that its easy to make them behave Trivial even You want a real challenge Try whores
Ive tried quite a few Well lots of work to do Enjoy the Eyrie
Come on Im here later Come on
Tonight then Looks like dull reading
You think all reading is dull reading
Its an opinion I share with some of the finest men I know
The secret history of the Seven Kingdoms is written in these pages
Unless Lord Twatbeard made up a bunch of numbers to hide what hes really up to
Unless he made it all up yes Podrick do keep up
Yes my lord
Podrick
Yes my lord
After a long consultation with my colleague Ser Bronn I finally found a suitable reward for the services youve provided over and above what might be considered reasonable Tell me Pod have you ever been with a woman
No my lord
Wonderful Genna specializes in firsttimers
Shes not bad with secondtimers either
Uh
A fair enough repayment for putting your spear through my wouldbe killers face wouldnt you say
Now as it happens Marei is quite the spear handler herself Shes here to thank you for staying by my side as the battle raged all around me
Hes handsome You didnt tell me he was handsome
Kayla is famous from here to Volantis in certain circles One of four women in the world who can perform a proper Meereenese Knot
My lord
Shes here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow whos never once failed to address me as my lord
Be back in time for my supper
Pace yourself lad
For years Ive heard that Littlefinger is a magician Whenever the crown needs money he rubs his hands together and poof mountains of gold
Let me guess Hes not a magician
No
Hes stealing it
Worse hes borrowing it
Whats wrong with that
We cant afford to pay it back thats whats wrong with it The crown owes millions to my father
Seeing as its his grandsons ass on the throne I imagine hell forgive that debt
Forgive a debt my father For a man of the world youre strangely naive
Ive never borrowed money before Im not clear on the rules
Well Ahem The basic principle is I lend you money and after an agreed upon period of time you return it with interest
And what if I dont
Well you have to
But what if I dont
This is why I dont lend you money Anyway its not my father Im worried about Its the Iron Bank of Braavos We owe them tens of millions If we fail to repay these loans the bank will fund our enemies One way or another they always get their gold back
Ah the return of the conquering hero Does he have a little jaunt in his step
The lads practically skipping
You were gone a long time I trust you got your moneys worth Or should I say my moneys worth
Oh it was a gift Podrick This is more than I give you in a year
Hes a squire You dont pay him
Oh then its much more than I give you in a year
They wouldnt take it my lord
Maybe theyre trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin
Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them
What did you tell them
I didnt tell them anything
What did you do to them
Lots of things
And they seemed to like these things
Yes my lord
Of course they seemed to like it Theyre paid to seem to like it
Only they werent paid
What are you saying These ladies enjoyed him so much they gave him the time for free
Is that what youre telling us PODRICK doesnt deny it
Sit down Podrick
Were going to need details Copious details
Come on Come on Come on Come on
Ha Ha
You know how we deal with runaways here do you
Take off his pants
No No No no no
Im gonna fuck you into the dirt
No please No no no No dont
No please No No
You little bastard
Come my lord
Youre a long way from home and winter is coming
Ill take the big bitch first When shes good and wet you lot can finish her off
My lord I am Brienne of Tarth Lady Catelyn Stark commanded me to deliver Ser Jaime to Kings Landing
Catelyn Starks a treasonous cunt Orders were to take the Kingslayer alive Nobody said shit about you
Youre only making it worse
Take her over there where its dark Id like a little privacy
Come on
You know who she is dont you
A big dumb bitch from who cares where Never been with a woman that big
Shes Brienne of Tarth Her father is Lord Selwyn Tarth Heard of Tarth
Im gonna cut your throat
They call it the Sapphire Isle Do you know why Every sapphire in Westeros was mined on Tarth Sapphires are gemstones The blue ones
I know what they are
Lord Selwyn would pay his daughters weight in sapphires if shes returned to him But only if shes alive her honor unbesmirched
Bring her back here
Yes my lord Get up
Come on
Come on on your feet
Unbesmirched
Not defiled
Fancy word for a fancy man
I hated to read as a child but my father forced me to study the books every morning before I could practice with sword or horse Two hours every day holed up in the maesters chambers I learned a lot of fancy words
I bet you did
Your father hed pay your weight in gold to get you back
Youll be a rich man till the end of your days And your sons will be rich men and their sons after them Lands titles youll have them all The North cant win this war Youre a smart man You understand that We have the numbers We have the gold
Aye you have both
Fighting bravely for a losing cause is admirable Fighting for a winning cause is far more rewarding
Hard to argue with that
Now that were speaking together man to man I wonder if you need to keep me chained to this tree Im not asking to be freed from my constraints but if I could sleep lying down my back would thank you for it Im not as young and resilient as I was once
None of us are Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree
Come on men
Suppose youll be wanting something to eat
Im famished actually
I think weve got a spare partridge on the fire
Well I do like partridge
Bring the bird over here and the carving knife Will this work as a table my lord
Oh yes Yes this will do nic ah
On the stump
You think youre the smartest man there is That everyone alive has to bow and scrape and lick your boots
My father
And if you get in any trouble all youve got to do is say my father and thats it all your troubles are gone
Dont
Have you got something to say
Careful You dont want to say the wrong thing Youre nothing without your daddy and your daddy aint here Never forget that
How many of those fingers do you think we could shove up his ass
Depends if hes had any practice Is that the sort of thing you and your sister go in for Kingslayer She loosened you up for us
Hes going to fall Hes going to fall off his horse Someone help him
Water Water Please water Wawater Water please Please Please
If I die you wont be getting
Oh enough Here
Cant say that Ive ever seen a man drink horse piss that fast
Stop
Far enough
Do that again and Ill take your other hand
Come on you
Oh Lord Tyrion Come in come in
I hope we might speak In confidence
Oh always in confidence
About the events of the Blackwater Perhaps this is the wrong time
Oh no Its a wonderful time
I thought one of your little birds might have knowledge of my sisters intentions to
End your life
I didnt inherit Littlefingers spies along with his position Im afraid Which is why Im coming to you I need proof
Proof Will there be a trial
I need to know
I have no proof only whispers Before all this nastiness I was going to tell you the story of how I was cut Do you want to hear it still
I dont know Do I
As a boy I travelled with a troupe of actors through the Free Cities One day in Myr a certain man made my master an offer too tempting to refuse I feared the man meant to use me as Id heard some men used small boys But what he wanted was far worse He gave me a potion that made me powerless to move or speak yet did nothing to dull my senses With a hooked blade he sliced me root and stem chanting all the while He burned my parts in a brazier The flames turned blue and I heard a voice answer his call I still dream of that night Not of the sorcerer not of his blade I dream of the voice from the flames Was it a god A demon A conjurors trick I dont know But the sorcerer called and a voice answered And ever since that day I have hated magic and all those who practice it But you can see why I was eager to aid in your fight against Stannis and his Red Priestess A symbolic revenge of sorts
Yes ahem I feel the need for actual revenge against the actual person who tried to have me killed Which will require a degree of influence which
You do not possess at the moment
But influence is largely a matter of patience I have found Once I had served the sorcerers purpose he threw me out of his house to die I resolved to live to spite him I begged I sold what parts of my body remained to me I became an excellent thief and soon learned that the contents of a mans letters are more valuable than the contents of his purse Step by step one distasteful task after another I made my way from the slums of Myr to the small council chamber Influence grows like a weed I tended mine patiently until its tendrils reached from the Red Keep all the way across to the far side of the world where I managed to wrap them around something very special
The sorcerer
Hello my old friend Its been a long time I have no doubt the revenge you want will be yours in time if you have the stomach for it
When people talk about the Nights Watch they never mention the shoveling
Or the shit
They tell you about honor pardoning crimes and protecting the realm but shoveling really is most of it
And getting attacked or killed or worse And that
But when youre not getting attacked or killed usually youre shoveling
Oh look More shit I was starting to wonder what to do with the rest of my day
We need to get out of here
When the Lord Commander says we go we go
The Lord Commander told us to go to the Fist of the First Men Howd that turn out for us
He had no way of knowing
We do now We know whats out there
Crasters been out here surviving
So hes your new protector now Our good friend Craster
Were like the sons he never had
Mormont isnt gonna save you This lummox here isnt gonna save you When the walkers come calling Craster will serve us up like so many pigs If we want to live well have to look out for ourselves
Shh shh shh
You woke him
Im sorry Hes beautiful
Shh
Hes beautiful Does he have a name
No
Are you going to give him one
Why
Here
Gilly
You said to hold it for you until you came back Youre back
I wanted you to have it
I dont want your stupid thimble I want to save my babys life Can you do that Can you
I dont have time for you I dont have time for anyone but him because he doesnt have much time
You have to go after him
How
You know how
Brandon
Mother
How many times have I told you No climbing
Mother I need to find it Its here Its calling me
I want you to promise me No more climbing
Promise me Promise me Promise me
Mother Mother
Promise me Promise me Bran Promise me
Is he very large
No larger than usual apparently And yet they said that he was
Extraordinary
The most extraordinary man theyve ever had And theyve had a lot of men
Were talking about the same Podrick The quiet boy in Lord Tyrions service Seems a bit simple
What did he do to them
I dont know my lord The girls are usually quite descriptive
So what did they say
They said it was hard to describe
Huh Prodigies appear in the oddest of places And what did Littlefinger say about this loss of income
He was too preoccupied to notice Hes leaving for the Eyrie soon Im helping him prepare for his journey
Ah yes to pursue his enduring love of the Lady Arryn and the title that comes with her Sad really Is that all it takes to make our friend lose interest in poor Sansa Stark
He hasnt spoken to her since the last time as far as I know But I dont think hes lost interest
What makes you say so
His shipboard inventory
Ah You can read Rare for a woman in your profession
Former profession
Of course Im missing something obvious youre about to point out
Two featherbeds Hes bringing two featherbeds for the cabin
Who is important enough to Littlefinger to merit a featherbed besides Littlefinger Could he be bringing one of his girls
Hes not interested in them my lord
How do you know
Because Im one of his girls
Prodigies in odd places indeed
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered by her brother or rather his dragon It ate her while her son watched Whats left of her is buried in the crypts right down there
The ceremony is traditionally held in the main sanctum which seats 700 comfortably
There appears to be a good deal of room elsewhere on the premises for everyone else
There arent more than 700 people of any importance
No the rest are there to look adoringly upon the 700 to remind them how superior they must be to have the best seats
Over there in that urn the ashes of Aerion Targaryen Aerion Brightflame they called him He thought drinking wildfire would turn him into a dragon
He was wrong And of course theres the Mad King killed by my uncle Would you like to see where the last Targaryens are buried
Are you sure Lady Margaery doesnt find all this a bit macabre
Oh no its quite all right Your Grace Id love to see their tombs really Its like taking a walk through history
The tombs just up here
This is so exciting
You were married here Your Grace
Yes
Must seem like only yesterday
Seems like a lifetime ago
Your husband was he buried here as well
No he wanted his remains returned to Storms End
Such a tragedy
A fairly predictable tragedy Hunting and drinking dont mix
I should say not My sons a hunter It helps him forget hes never been within a mile of a real battle
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storms End for the better part of a year
All he laid siege to was the banquet table in the command tent
I told him to stay out of Roberts rebellion He had no business fighting an actual warrior We mothers do what we can to keep our sons from the grave But they do seem to yearn for it We shower them with good sense and it slides right off like rain off a wing
And yet the world belongs to them
A ridiculous arrangement to my mind
The gods have seen fit to make it so
My father didnt want them here He was going to have their bodies burned and thrown in the Blackwater but the High Septon convinced him otherwise
Im glad he did Im sorry Your Grace I know they did terrible things at the end but their ancestors built this Sometimes severity is the price we pay for greatness
I couldnt agree more
Shall we go and see them If you give them your love they will return it a thousandfold Ive spoken with them I know how they feel about you You led the defense of Kings Landing They adore you
Open the doors
Joffrey Wait
Lady Margaery
Lady Margaery
Bless you Lady Margaery
Lady Margaery
Lady Margaery
Margaery
Long live Lady Margaery
King Joffrey
King Joffrey
King Joffrey
King Joffrey
Gods bless King Joffrey
How far is it to Deepwood Motte
Not far my lord Your sister is waiting for you there
She sent you to save me
Yes I served them the men who were torturing you I did what they told me and waited for the right moment
Why would you risk your life for me
I grew up on Saltcliffe my lord I was only a boy when they took you away My father brought me and my brothers up to the bluffs so we could watch the ship that carried you off I remember the look on my fathers face when he told us Thats Balon Greyjoys last living son And those are the words I heard over and over again when I saw what they were doing to you
Those men they said my father knew what they were doing to me Did he
I I dont know my lord They they never told me much
My sisters men are loyal to her We dont need to hide from them
Not all those are your sisters men Some of them are loyal to your father
What is it
I was just thinking how jealous I was when my father told Yara to take this place
What did he tell you to do
Raid fishing villages He didnt trust me Thought I was a Stark Ha I could never be a Stark Robb Stark always reminded me of that
He lorded it over you
Didnt have to All he had to do was be Be who he was born to be His life fit him better than his clothes How could someone like that ever be a brother to me Hes the King in the North
And me my father gave me a choice and I made it I could never be a Stark But ironborn thats what I was born to be I paid the iron price for Winterfell I murdered those boys
The Stark boys
Never found them Just some poor orphans living with a farmer I let Dagmer slit their throats and I let him burn the bodies so I could keep Winterfell and make my father proud
Maybe its not too late
It is My real father lost his head at Kings Landing I made a choice and I chose wrong And now Ive burned everything down
Not everything my lord Shes up here
Yara
Shh Wait
I brought him back He killed the others
What No I didnt
You cant No please stop No
Put him back where he belongs
Eat What are you doing
Im dying
You cant die You need to live to take revenge
I dont care about revenge
You coward A little misfortune and youre giving up
Misfor misfortune
You lost your hand
My sword hand I was that hand
You have a taste one taste of the real world where people have important things taken from them and you whine and cry and quit You sound like a bloody woman
I know what you did for me You told them Tarth was full of sapphires Its called the Sapphire Isle because of the blue of its water You knew that Why did you help me
You wanted to speak to me
Yes about Jaime
What about him
I wanted to make sure were doing everything we can to get him back
When Catelyn Stark took Tyrion prisoner what did I do in response
You started a war
And if I would start a war for that lecherous little stump what do you think I am doing for my oldest son and heir
Whatever you can
Whatever I can
Youre still here
Yes
Why
Did it ever occur to you that I might be the one who deserves your confidence and your trust not your sons Not Jaime or Tyrion but me Years and years of lectures on family and legacy the same lecture really just with tiny tedious variations did it ever occur to you that your daughter might be the only one listening to them Living by them That she might have the most to contribute to your legacy that you love so much more than your actual children
All right Contribute
The Tyrells are a problem
The Tyrells helped us defeat Stannis Baratheon The Tyrells saved your life your childrens lives
Margaery has her claws in Joffrey She knows how to manipulate him
Good I wish you knew how to manipulate him I dont distrust you because youre a woman I distrust you because youre not as smart as you think you are Youve allowed that boy to ride roughshod over you and everyone else in this city
Perhaps you should try stopping him from doing what he likes
I will
Do you like it Nana
Another golden rose How original I eat from plates stamped with roses I sleep in sheets embroidered with roses I have a golden rose painted on my chamber pot as if that makes it smell any better Roses are boring dear Growing strong Ha The dullest words of any house Winter is coming Now thats memorable We do not sow Strong Strong Those are houses you watch out for Direwolves and krakens fierce beasts But a golden rose growing strong ha that strikes fear in the heart
Look little loves A spider in the garden Run along now Grow strong
My lady I wanted to personally welcome you to Kings Landing The city has been made brighter by your presence
The city is made brighter by my presence Is that your usual line Lord Varys Are you here to seduce me
A little obvious perhaps
Oh no please Seduce away Its been so long Though I rather think its all for naught What happens when the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit A question for the philosophers But youve come mincing all this way for something So
Might I sit
No Come Ive heard youre such a clever man Im curious why youve sought me out
Youve taken an interest in Sansa Stark
Have I Because I spoke to her once in this garden and one of your little spies came running to tell you Why shouldnt I take an interest Shes an interesting girl
Is she
No not particularly But shes had an interesting childhood
She has sadly Well forgive me for wasting your time then I thought we shared certain hopes for her wellbeing
Come come You surrender rather easily Walk with me I know the walls have ears but apparently the shrubbery does too
I choose my allies carefully and my enemies more carefully still
Which is Sansa Stark
Neither A babe in the woods I admired her father
Yes Ned Stark had many admirers and how many stepped forward when the executioner came for his head
I could not help Lord Stark Perhaps I can help his daughter
How
Youre not the only one who has taken an interest in her
Thats hardly surprising Shes a beautiful girl with a famous name
Indeed Shed make a lovely match for the right suitor
It almost feels as if youre about to arrive at the point
Littlefinger is not long for the capital A confidant of mine has told me that when he goes Sansa Stark goes with him
And why have you come to me with this matter
Littlefinger was born with no lands no wealth no armies He has acquired the first two How long before he has the army
Perhaps youll laugh but I know him better than most and this is the truth Littlefinger is one of the most dangerous men in Westeros If Robb Stark falls Sansa Stark is the key to the North
And if Littlefinger marries her hell have the key in his pocket
Which seems such a shame Why should a man with such a low reputation steal away such a lovely bride
You must despise him Youre working so hard to undermine him
Actually I rather enjoy him But he would see this country burn if he could be king of the ashes
You are a clever man Lord Varys
You are too kind I believe I have a possible solution
One doesnt need to be clever for that Its all rather obvious isnt it
Ahem I didnt mean to disturb you
You havent
Wed like some privacy please If you wouldnt mind waiting back inside the keep Or if youd be kind enough to give me your names Ill ask the king to speak with you himself
What did you pray for
I cant tell you
Why not Ill tell you what I prayed for in the sept this morning Lets see for my familys health and happiness for an end to the war for a short winter Boring and traditional Im afraid And you
Im sorry I just cant
My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl Id ever seen When I was 12 I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me Pigface she called me
Pigface Thats ridiculous
I think it had something to do with my nose Whenever she passed me in the halls shed oink
So I prayed that shed catch a horrible skin disease A week after that she came down with porridge plague
Porridge plague
You dont have it in the North Your skin starts to look like boiled oats and eventually your face slides off and you die in agony
But thats awful
Youre I believed you Porridge plague Im an idiot
Dont say that No youre not
So what happened to Alanna
Oh she grew up to be the most beautiful woman and married a handsome lord and they have darling children and live in a castle by the sea Its all terribly frustrating
Im sure shes jealous of you now Youll be married here in the capital and shell have to come watch and pretend to be happy that youre queen
I want us to be friends good friends
That would make me very happy
You must see Highgarden Youd love it there I know you would We have a great masquerade the night of the harvest moon You should see the costumes People work on them for months
I I dont think the queen would let me leave Kings Landing
The Queen Regent you mean Once I marry Joffrey Ill be queen And if you were to marry Loras Oh your place would be at Highgarden wouldnt it We would be sisters you and I Would you like that
His name was Bannen He was a good man a good ranger He came to us from where did he come from
Down White Harbor way
He came to us from White Harbor Never failed in his duty He kept his vows the best he could He rode far fought fiercely We shall never see his like again
And now his watch has ended
And now his watch has ended
Didnt think a broke foot could kill a man
It wasnt his foot that killed him That bastard Craster starved him to death
Crasters got his daughters to feed
You on his side
We cant just show up and steal all his food Were brothers of the Nights Watch not thieves
The day we leave Craster will tap a barrel of our wine and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes and laugh at us starving in the snow Hes a bloody wildling is all he is
Never knew Bannen could smell so good
You have one son dont you Mormont I had my 99th You ever meet a man with 99 sons
And more daughters than I can count
Im glad for you
Are you now Me Ill be glad when you and yours have gone
As soon as our wounded are strong enough
Ah Theyre as strong as theyre gonna get Them thats dying why dont you cut their throats and be done with it Hmm Or leave them if youve not the stomach and Ill sort them myself
Whose throat you gonna cut old man
Wait outside
Its cold outside and theres nothing to eat
My wives gave you bread
Theres sawdust in the bread
You dont like it you go out there and eat the snow
Id rather eat what youve got hidden away
I told you to wait outside
Hes sitting there drinking our wine eating his fill while we die
I gave you crows enough Ive got to feed my women
So you admit youve got a hidden larder then How elsed you make it through winter
Enough Out
I am a godly man
Youre a stingy bastard
Bastard Out with you you little thief And you And you Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies Ill chop the hands off the next man who calls me bastard
You are a bastard A daughterfucking wildling bastard
The gods will curse us for this By all the laws
There are no laws beyond the Wall Now show us where he hides the food or youll get the same as he did
Unhand her
I shall have your head for this
Quickly Quickly
Whats happening Im not going out there
No we have to go Now
Follow me I know the best way Come on
Run fast Piggy and sleep well Ill be cutting your throat one of these nights
Can I take this hood off yet
I do apologize little lady but its better for you if you dont see where were going
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Halt
What is it
Blackstrap rum
Ugh
Not easy finding molasses in wartime
Id have some
Lets go home
What is this place
Somewhere neither wolves nor lions come prowling
You look like a bunch of swineherds
Some of us were swineherds And some of us tanners and masons That was before
Youre still swineherds and tanners and masons You think carrying a crooked spear makes you a soldier
No Fighting in a war makes you a soldier
Beric Dondarrion Youve seen better days
And I wont see them again
Stark deserters Baratheon deserters You lot arent fighting in a war Youre running from it
Last I heard you were King Joffreys guard dog But here you are 1000 miles from home Which of us is running
Untie these ropes and well find out What are you doing leading a mob of peasants
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your brother in King Roberts name
Ned Stark is dead King Robert is dead My brothers alive
Youre fighting for ghosts
Thats what we are ghosts waiting for you in the dark You cant see us but we see you No matter whose cloak you wear Lannister Stark Baratheon you prey on the weak the Brotherhood without Banners will hunt you down
You found god Is that it
Aye Ive been reborn in the light of the one true god As have we all As would any man whos seen the things weve seen
If you mean to murder me then bloody well get on with it
Youll die soon enough dog But it wont be murder only justice
And a kinder fate than you deserve Lions you call yourselves At the Mummers Ford girls of seven years were raped and babes still on the breast were cut in two while their mothers watched
I wasnt at the Mummers Ford Dump your dead children at some other door
House Clegane was built upon dead children I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess Rhaenys before the Iron Throne
Do you take me for my brother Is being born Clegane a crime
Murder is a crime
I never touched the Targaryen babes I never saw them never smelled them never heard them bawling You want to cut my throat get on with it But dont call me murderer and pretend that youre not
You murdered Mycah The butchers boy My friend He was 12 years old He was unarmed And you rode him down You slung him over your horse like he was some deer
Aye he was a bleeder
You dont deny killing this boy
I was Joffreys sworn shield The boy attacked the prince
Thats a lie I hit Joffrey Mycah just ran away
Then I should have killed you Not my place to question princes
You stand accused of murder But no one here knows the truth of the charge so it is not for us to judge you Only the Lord of Light may do that now I sentence you to trial by combat
So who will it be Should we find out if your fire god really loves you priest Or you archer What are you worth with a sword in your hand Or is the little girl the bravest one here
Aye She might be But its me youll fight
The master says they are untested He says you would be wise to blood them early There are many small cities between here and there cities ripe for sacking Should you take captives the masters will buy the healthy ones and for a good price
And who knows In 10 years some of the boys you send them may be Unsullied in their turn Thus all shall prosper
Is it done then They belong to me
It is done
It is done
She holds the whip
You hold the whip
The bitch has her army
Unsullied
Forward march
Halt
Tell the bitch her beast wont come
A dragon is not a slave
You speak Valyrian
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen of the blood of Old Valyria Valyrian is my mother tongue
Unsullied Slay the masters slay the soldiers slay every man who holds a whip but harm no child Strike the chains off every slave you see
I am your master
Kill her Kill her Kill her
Dracarys
Unsullied You have been slaves all your life Today you are free Any man who wishes to leave may leave and no one will harm him I give you my word Will you fight for me As free men
Lord cast your light upon us
Lord of Light defend us
Show us the truth Strike this man down if he is guilty Give strength to his sword if he is true Lord of Light give us wisdom For the night is dark and full of terrors
For the night is dark and full of terrors
Get back
Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty Guilty
Kill him
Lord cast your light upon this man your servant Bring him back from death and darkness His flame has been extinguished Restore it
For the night is dark and full of terrors Lord cast

Let go of me Let me go
Looks like their god likes me more than your butchers boy
Burn in hell
He will But not today
Orell says there are crows patrolling on the Wall Tell me what you know
There are four to a patrol two builders to check for structural damage two rangers to watch for enemies
How often do these patrols go out
It varies If I knew where on the Wall we were heading I could tell you
Youd like to know that
There are 19 castles guarding the Wall How many are manned
Three
You sure of that
Which three
Castle Black
Aye Castle Black Everyone knows Castle Black Which others
EastwatchbytheSea and the Shadow Tower
How many men remain in Castle Black
Liar
What happens to your eagle after I kill you Does he drift away like a kite with his strings cut or does he just flop dead to the ground
Hes no crow
Just cause you want him inside you dont make him one of us
Im not afraid of you
I like you boy But if you lie to me Ill pull your guts out through your throat
1000 men
Well find out soon enough
I dont need you to protect me
Of course you do Who stopped Rattleshirt when he was about to cut your throat Who vouched for you with Mance It seems you owe me a debt

Well I stole it Its mine If you want it come steal it back
Ygritte Ygritte
Ygritte Seven hells Ygritte

Ygritte
You swore some vows I want you to break em I want you to see me
All of me
We shouldnt
We should
Why are you still dressed You know nothing Jon Sno
That thing you did with your mouth is that what lords do to their ladies in the South
I dont know I just wanted to kiss you there is all
Hmm
You seemed to like it
Aye I liked it some Who taught you that
Theres been no one else Only you
A maid You were a maid
I was a man of the Nights Watch How about you Were you a maid
What do you think
Who was he
Just a boy He came trading with his brothers He had red hair like me Kissed by fire But he was weak Not like you That was the first one Then there was this Thenn boy Spoke no Common but gods he was built like a mammoth
Yeah thanks I think Ive heard enough Wed best get back Tormund
Im not done with you yet
How longs it been since you had a bath
Lets not go back Lets stay here a while longer I dont ever want to leave this cave Jon Snow Not ever
I want my gold
It says it clearly right there on that note youll be repaid in full when the war is over
Piss on that Youre nothing but thieves
Were outlaws Outlaws steal Youre lucky we didnt kill you
Come try it archer Ill shove those arrows up your ass
You cant let him go Hes a murderer Hes guilty
Not in the eyes of god
You cant
Enough The judgment isnt ours to make
Go in peace Sandor Clegane The Lord of Light isnt done with you yet
Riders coming through
ingslayer
Down
On your knees Lord Bolton I give you the Kingslayer
Pick him up Locke
Youve lost a hand
No my lord he has it here
Take this away
Send it to his father
Youll hold your tongue unless you want to lose it
Cut her free Apologies my lady Youre under my protection now
Thank you my lord
Find suitable rooms for our guests Well speak later
Lord Bolton
Is there word from the capital
You havent heard Stannis Baratheon laid siege to Kings Landing Sailed into Blackwater Bay Stormed the gates with thousands of men And your sister How can I put this Your sister is alive and well Your fathers forces prevailed
Ser Jaime isnt well Take him to Qyburn
Will I die
No The corruption has spread I fear it must be cut away The safest course would be to take the whole arm off
Then youll die Youre no maester Wheres your chain
The Citadel stripped me of it They found some of my experiments too bold I can leave your upper arm make the cut at your elbow
I dont need my right hand to kill you
I can take away the rotting flesh and try and burn out the corruption with boiling wine
Mmm
With any luck that will suffice Youll need milk of the poppy
No milk of the poppy
There will be pain
Ill scream
Quite a bit of pain
Ill scream loudly
Lord Baelish
Your Grace
I wonder if I might ask you for a favor
Of course Your Grace
I have reason to believe that House Tyrell do not hold the crowns best interests at heart
I see And have you shared these suspicions with Lord Tywin
My fathers a practical man He appreciates facts
Myself I often find them a hindrance
And he appreciates those who aid his family as you well know Hes almost as generous to those who help us as he is unpleasant towards those who dont You have a good working relationship with the Tyrells I thought you might look into it before you leave the capital
I shall do my best
Thank you And your best will prove better than when I asked you to locate Arya Stark
I assure you that it will
Gods boy thats enough Were not in a tavern
Pardon my lady
No need to speak Are there any figs Fetch some I always take figs midafternoon They help move the bowels To what do I owe this summons
Thank you for seeing me my lady I had hoped we might discuss a few financial matters
I climbed all those steps to discuss financial matters
Its the royal wedding Im told you had a hand in planning it
Naturally
Its shaping up to be a very involved affair The word extravagant has been used
What good is the word extravagant if it cant be used to describe a royal wedding
I understand that
Good
But as Master of Coin it falls upon me to calculate the cost for the crown As of now its a huge expense
And
And were at war Lady Olenna
Oh Id nearly forgotten
Yes and maintaining supply lines
I cant think how it slipped my mind What is it 12000 infantrymen the Tyrell family has supplied 2000 in support Provisions so this city might survive the winter A million bushels of wheat Half a million bushels each of barley oats and rye 20000 head of cattle 50000 sheep You dont have to lecture me about wartime expenses Im quite familiar with them
And we are so grateful for your contributions which are necessary for the preservation of the realm
As is a royal wedding The people are hungry for more than just food They crave distractions And if we dont provide them theyll create their own And their distractions are likely to end with us being torn to pieces A royal wedding is much safer Wouldnt you say
I would
And traditionally paid for by the royal family
I was told you were drunk impertinent and thoroughly debauched You can imagine my disappointment at finding nothing but a browbeaten bookkeeper Where did you go for them Volantis
My lady
Oh very well I wont have it said that House Tyrell refuses to play its part Well pay for half the expenses and the celebrations will go on as planned Is that sufficient
Quite sufficient Thank you
Very good then Thats settled Good day
Give me that
What are you doing
Just mending Lord Berics armor
Why
Im going to stay on and smith for the Brotherhood
Have you lost your mind When the Lannisters find this place you think theyll spare the smiths Theyll cave your head in with your own helmet
The Lannisters wanted to kill me long before I joined the Brotherhood
You dont have to do this
I want to They need good men
Robb needs good men too Were leaving tomorrow And then you
What Serve him Ive served men my entire life I served Master Mott at Kings Landing and he sold me to the Watch I served Lord Tywin at Harrenhal wondering every day if Id get tortured or killed Im done serving
You just said you were serving Lord Beric
He may be their leader but they chose him These men are brothers Theyre a family Ive never had a family
I can be your family
You wouldnt be my family Youd be my lady
Willem Willem
Is this a rescue
Lannister filth Take him MARTYN Please I didnt do anything Im just a squire Please
Bring them in
Is that all of them It took five of you to murder two unarmed squires
Not murder Your Grace Vengeance
Vengeance Those boys didnt kill your sons I saw Harrion die on the battlefield and Torrhen
Was strangled by the Kingslayer They were his kin
They were boys Look at them
Tell your mother to look at them She killed them as much as I
My mother had nothing to do with this This was your treason
Its treason to free your enemies In war you kill your enemies Did your father not teach you that boy
Leave him
Aye Leave me to the king He wants to give me a scolding before he sets me free Thats how he deals with treason Our King in the North Or should I call him the King Who Lost the North
Escort Lord Karstark to the dungeon Hang the rest
Mercy sire I didnt kill anyone I only watched for the guards
This one was only the watcher Hang him last so he can watch the others die
Please Please no They made me do it They made me They made me
Word of this cant leave Riverrun They were Tywin Lannisters nephews The Lannisters pay their debts They never stop talking about it
Would you make me a liar as well as a murderer
It wouldnt be lying We will bury them and remain silent until the war is done
Im not fighting for justice if I dont serve justice to murderers in my ranks no matter how highborn He has to die
arstarks are Northmen They wont forgive the killing of their lord
Your mothers right If you do this the Karstarks will abandon you
You tended to their wounds You brought them supper Now theyre dead
And more boys will keep dying until this war is over You need Karstark men to end it
Spare his life Keep him as a hostage
A hostage Tell the Karstarks that as long as they remain loyal he will not be harmed
The blood of the First Men flows through my veins as much as yours boy I fought the Mad King for your father I fought Joffrey for you We are kin Stark and Karstark
That didnt stop you from betraying me And it wont save you now
I dont want it to save me I want it to haunt you to the end of your days
Kneel my lord
Rickard Karstark Lord of Karhold here in sight of gods and men I sentence you to die Would you speak a final word
Kill me and be cursed You are no king of mine
Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne The Hound What are you going to do with me
At first light well ride for Riverrun Your brothers there now Hell make a contribution to our cause and you can go home
Im a hostage and youre selling me
Dont think of it that way
But it is that way
It is And it isnt
More is than isnt
Beric admired your father a great deal you know He wanted to refuse your ransom altogether
So why dont you
We need the gold
Do I frighten you child
No
Youre angry with me And I dont blame you But letting him go was the right thing I have more reason than most to want him hanged
I thought he killed you
But how
Thoros how many times have you brought me BACK
Its the Lord of Light brings you back Im just the lucky drunk who says the words
How many times
Five I think No this makes six
Six
There was the first time the Mountain Show her Lance right through the chest
Then I was stabbed in the belly
Then it was an arrow in the back And that axe in the side
Then the Lannisters caught me and executed me for treason Was it a hanging or a dagger in the eye
Both Fuckers couldnt decide
And the Hound makes six
Second time Ive been killed by a Clegane
Youd think youd learn Its not getting any easier you know
I know Every time I come back Im a bit less Pieces of you get chipped away
Could you bring back a man without a head Not six times Just once
I dont think it works that way child
He was a good man Ned Stark Hes at rest now somewhere I would never wish my life upon him
I would Youre alive
Lord cast your light upon me Protect me in the darkness Burn away my sins Help me serve you Use me as you will For the night is dark and full of terrors
I have prayed day and night for you to come to me
My lady
I meant to come sooner The battle
I know of your troubles My king The Lady Melisandre has told me everything
Yes of course
You mustnt despair Your claim is true You will be victorious
I believed that once
You are the one gods champion and the finest man Ive ever known
Selyse Ive broken a sacred vow Ive sinned
No
Ive wronged you I have shamed you
Youre doing gods work
You dont understand The Red Woman the Lady Melisandre
I know Stannis The Lady Melisandre has told me everything No act done in service of the Lord of Light can ever be a sin When she told me I wept with joy
Oh my sweet boys Petyr Tommard Edric I thank god every day for bringing Melisandre to us She gave you a son I gave you nothing
Thats not true
So youve come to see her as well There is no need You must keep away from such distractions
Shes my daughter I want to see her
You are a king You dont need my permission
Under the sea I know I know Oh oh
Insid s room
The birds have scales  And the fish take wing  I know I know  Oh oh
Shireen
Father
Youve grown since I last saw you
Mother said you fought in a battle Did you win
No
Did the Onion Knight come back with you
He fought bravely
He hasnt come to visit me He said hed bring me back a present from the capital
He wont be visiting child
Why not Hes my friend Look
He made this for me But dont tell Mother I have it Its a secret Mother doesnt like the Onion Knight
Ser Davos is a traitor Hes rotting in a dungeon cell for his crime Best forget him
Not so hard Youll scrub the skin off
What are you doing here
I need a bath Help me out of these rags
Now get out
Theres another tub
This one suits me fine Dont worry Im not interested If I faint pull me out I dont intend to be the first Lannister to die in a bathtub
Why should I care how you die
You swore a solemn vow remember Youre supposed to get me to Kings Landing in one piece Not going so well is it No wonder Renly died with you guarding him
That was unworthy Forgive me You protected me better than most
Dont you mock me
Im apologizing Im sick of fighting Lets call a truce
You need trust to have a truce
I trust you
There it is Theres the look Ive seen it for 17 years on face after face You all despise me Kingslayer Oathbreaker A man without honor Youve heard of wildfire
Of course
The Mad King was obsessed with it He loved to watch people burn the way their skin blackened and blistered and melted off their bones He burned lords he didnt like He burned Hands who disobeyed him He burned anyone who was against him Before long half the country was against him Aerys saw traitors everywhere So he had his pyromancer place caches of wildfire all over the city beneath the Sept of Baelor and the slums of Flea Bottom Under houses stables taverns Even beneath the Red Keep itself Finally the day of reckoning came Robert Baratheon marched on the capital after his victory at the Trident But my father arrived first with the whole Lannister army at his back promising to defend the city against the rebels I knew my father better than that Hes never been one to pick the losing side I told the Mad King as much I urged him to surrender peacefully But the king didnt listen to me He didnt listen to Varys who tried to warn him But he did listen to Grand Maester Pycelle that grey sunken cunt You can trust the Lannisters he said The Lannisters have always been true friends of the crown So we opened the gates and my father sacked the city Once again I came to the king begging him to surrender He told me to bring him my fathers head Then he turned to his pyromancer Burn them all he said Burn them in their homes Burn them in their beds Tell me if your precious Renly commanded you to kill your own father and stand by while thousands of men women and children burned alive would you have done it Would you have kept your oath then
First I killed the pyromancer And then when the king turned to flee I drove my sword into his back Burn them all he kept saying Burn them all I dont think he expected to die He he meant to burn with the rest of us and rise again reborn as a dragon to turn his enemies to ash I slit his throat to make sure that didnt happen Thats where Ned Stark found me
If this is true why didnt you tell anyone Why didnt you tell Lord Stark
Stark You think the honorable Ned Stark wanted to hear my side He judged me guilty the moment he set eyes on me By what right does the wolf judge the lion By what right
Help Help ingslayer
Jaime My name is Jaime
Onion Knight Ser Onion Knight
Princess Gods what are you doing here
Shh youll wake Bert
Bert
Hes the fat one Hes on guard duty tonight He likes to drink wine and sleep a lot
Go back to your room Youre not supposed to be here If your father knew
he said you Were a traitor Are you
I am child I disobeyed my king your father and now Im paying the price
I dont care Youre my friend You must get bored down here I brought you something to read Its about Aegon and his dragons Aegon used to live here Did you know that And the Targaryens built this castle
Aye So they did
You can hide the book under your cloak Its a good one Ill bring you more
Thank you my lady Im sure its a fine book but its wasted on me
Take it I have more
My lady I cant read the words
You cant
Ill teach you Ill come when Berts on duty and teach you
No No No
Its easy Itll be fun
Go We cant
Why not What will they do lock us in cells
I wouldnt know where to start
At the beginning This word is Aegon When you see A E and G together like that it sounds like egg And the title of the whole book is An History of Aegon the Conqueror and His Conquest of Westeros
It was a bitch of a siege
Mm you were first through the breach at Pyke
The second Thoros of Myr went in alone waving that flaming sword of his
Thoros of Myr Bloody madman Robert knighted you after the battle
Proudest moment of my life One knee in the dust the kings sword on my shoulder listening to the words In the name of the Warrior I charge you to be brave All I could think of was how badly I had to piss
In full plate metal for 16 hours Never occurred to me till the fighting was over I was very nearly the first man knighted to piss on the kings boots
Robert would have laughed He was a good man a great warrior And a terrible king I burned away my years fighting for terrible kings
You swore an oath
Yes And a man of honor keeps his vows even if hes serving a drunk or a lunatic Just once in my life before its over I want to know what its like to serve with pride to fight for someone I believe in Do you believe in her
With all my heart
These are the ones
Yes khaleesi The officers
You did not choose this life But you are free men now And free men make their own choices Have you selected your own leader from amongst your ranks
Remove your helmet GREY
This one has the honor
What is your name
Grey Worm
Grey Worm
All Unsullied boys are given new names when they are cut Grey Worm Red Flea Black Rat Names that remind them what they are vermin
From this day forward you will choose your own names You will tell your fellow soldiers to do the same Throw away your slave name Choose the name your parents gave you or any other A name that gives you pride
Grey Worm gives me pride It is a very lucky name The name this one was born with was cursed That was the name he had when he was taken as a slave But Grey Worm is the name this one had the day Daenerys Stormborn set him free
King Robert wanted her dead
Of course he wanted her dead Shes a Targaryen The last Targaryen
I suppose no one on the small council could speak sense to him
I didnt sit on the small council
No Doesnt the Lord of the Kingsguard traditionally
Traditionally yes but I killed a dozen of Roberts friends during his rebellion
He didnt want advice on how to govern from a man who had fought for the Mad King Cant say I minded much I always hated the politics
Yeah I imagine I would too Hours spent jabbering about backstabbings and betrayals the world over
Mmhmm
Still shell have to wade through that muck if she wants to rule the Seven Kingdoms
Shell have good men around her to advise her men with experience
Which men do you have in mind
Forgive me Ser Jorah for what Im about to say but your reputation in Westeros has suffered over the years
It suffered for a reason I sold men into slavery
I dont know if your presence by her side will help our cause when we go home
Our cause Forgive me Ser Barristan but I was busy defending the khaleesi against King Roberts assassins while you were still bowing to the man
We both want her to rule Am I wrong
You only joined us a few days ago I cant speak to your intentions
If were truly her loyal servants we will do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost no matter our pride
Youre not Lord here Youre just another exile And I take my orders from the queen
Come to bed
You were right
arstarks are gone Almost half our forces Tywin Lannister knows what he needs to do to make us unravel Nothing Only wait
Dont let him
What can I do Attack Kings Landing Theres nothing hed like better Hed crush us in a day
We could ride north Take your land back from the Greyjoys Wait out the winter
Winter could last five years Once my bannermen are home again sitting by the fire surrounded by their families warm and safe theyll never ride south again When I gathered my lords together we had a purpose a mission Now were like a band of bickering children
Give them a new purpose
What
Oh I dont know I dont even know where Winterfell is
Here And were here Kings Landing
What is it
I cant force them to meet us in the field and I cant attack them where theyre strongest but I can attack them where theyre not
And Casterly Rock cant run away Im going to take their home away from them
Can you do it
I need men to replace the Karstarks who marched home There is only one person in this kingdom with that kind of army who hasnt already sided with the Lannisters The man whose daughter I was supposed to marry Walder Frey
Hes such a splendid fighter Do you have any idea when we might
Ill plant the seed as soon as Joffrey and I are married It should grow quickly
Joffrey wont let me leave Hes got too many reasons to keep me here
And only one to let you go Because it will please me
Squire
Well fought ser
That was no fight I dont know you
Olyver if it please you
I should like to see you spar with a proper partner ser
How did you know
Know what
That I wanted to
My lord Ill have you know Im to be married soon and even my intended hasnt the slightest notion
They rarely do in my experience
You have a good deal of experience do you
With the husbands
That didnt take long
Well it took long enough It seems our Knight of Flowers is engaged to be wed
Is he And whos the lucky girl
She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest but shes mine Ive always wanted a ship Now I want a dozen Strange isnt it
What is
It doesnt matter what we want once we get it then we want something else Your hair is different
Is it
Lady Margaery wears it that way
Many ladies wear it this way
I have good news Ill be leaving the city soon
You still want me to come with you
Its not a question of what I want Its what you want You want to go home dont you
Of course More than anything But maybe it would be better to wait Ive been thinking how dangerous it would be Not just for me but for you Youve been so kind Id feel terrible if anything happened to you I cant tell you how touched I am by your concern for my welfare
I hope you know that Im your friend Sansa Your true friend
I do Lord Baelish
Petyr
Petyr
If you wish to stay then of course you will stay
Well speak again when I return
Youre late
Whats she doing here
Our business concerns her too Sit
Youll be pleased to learn that after one conversation with Olenna Tyrell Ive saved the crown hundreds of thousands on this wedding
Never mind that now We have something important to discuss
Im Master of Coin Saving money is important
Stop that Youre making me uncomfortable
Your sister has learned that your new friends the Tyrells are plotting to marry Sansa Stark to Ser Loras
Very well Shes a lovely girl Missing some of Loras favorite bits but Im sure theyll make do
Your jokes are not appreciated
It wasnt my best but
I bring them into the royal fold and this is how they repay me by trying to steal the key to the North out from under me
Sansa is the key to the North I seem to remember she has an older brother
arstarks have marched home The young wolf has lost half his army His days are numbered Theon Greyjoy murdered both his brothers That makes Sansa Stark the heir to Winterfell And I am not about to hand her over to the Tyrells
The Tyrell army is helping us to win this war Do you really think its wise to refuse them
Theres nothing to refuse This is a plot Plots are not public knowledge And the Tyrells wont carry this one out until after Joffreys wedding We need to act first and kill this union in its crib
And how do we do that
We find Sansa Stark a different husband
Wonderful
Yes it is
You cant mean it
I can and I do
Joffrey has made this poor girls life miserable since the day he took her fathers head Now shes finally free of him and you give her to me Thats cruel even for you
Do you intend on mistreating her The girls happiness is not my concern nor should it be yours
Shes a child
Shes flowered I assure you She and I have discussed it at length
There you see You will wed her bed her and put a child in her Surely youre capable of that
And if I refuse
You wanted to be rewarded for your valor in battle Sansa Stark is a finer reward than you could ever dare hope for And it is past time you were wed
I was wed Or dont you remember
Only too well
You should be thanking the gods for this This is more than you deserve
Tyrion will do as hes bid As will you
What do you mean
Youll marry Ser Loras
I will not
The boy is heir to Highgarden Tyrion will secure the North you will secure the Reach
No I wont do it
Yes you will Youre still fertile You need to marry again and breed
I am Queen Regent not some broodmare
Youre my daughter You will do as I command and you will marry Loras Tyrell and put an end to the disgusting rumors about you once and for all
Father dont make me do it again please
Not another word My children Youve disgraced the Lannister name for far too long
Youve got too much wood in there
But the more wood the bigger the fire
It needs to breathe Take off that big log
Huh You know your fires
Someone built your fires for you growing up
It doesnt get so cold down in the Reach And there were servants of course
I knew you were highborn
Oh I found something at the Fist of the First Men Buried treasure Thousands of years old I think
What does it do
Im not sure that it does anything Its beautiful though isnt it
How much longer
Not so far A few more days
Is the Wall as big as they say
Bigger So big you cant even see the top sometimes Its hidden in clouds
Youre playing with me
Im not Its 700 feet high all made of ice On a warm day you can see it weeping Castle Black is nice enough They keep a fire burning in the long hall day and night And Hobb makes venison stew with onions Very tasty Sometimes one of the brothers will sing Dareon sings best
Do you sing
No No no no Not very well
Sing me a song
Oh all right Lets see
Oh ahem The fathers face is stern and strong  He sits and judges right from wrong  He weighs our lives the short and long  And loves the little children  The mother gives the gift of life  And watches over every wife  Her gentle smile ends all strife And she loves her little children
Thats not how you skin a rabbit
I know how to skin a rabbit
Not by the looks of it
You grow up north of the Wall you learn the proper way to handle game
I didnt see any game before I got here
If I had a bow I could have shot a dozen rabbits
Well I made this bow myself Guess you dont learn how to do that north of the Wall
You learn how to use your fists though
Oh youre gonna punch the rabbits to death
I had someone else in mind
Well someone else is sitting right here
Youre both very good at skinning rabbits
Some of us are just a little better
Well some of us would say thank you when someone else hunts down their breakfast for them Or dont they teach you to say thank you north of the Wall
Youve got a big mouth girl and too many teeth
Stop it
Hodor
Youve been fighting since you met Just stop it
Lady Reed heres got a stick so far up her ass its a wonder her feet touch the ground
Youve been nasty to her every day Of course shes nasty back
Me Its my fault First time I met her she put a knife to my throat
First time I met you you held a knife at me We cant fight each other Well never make it to the Wall I want you both to make peace
Your way of skinning rabbits is quicker than mine
I said so didnt I
Osha
Youre a good little hunter
Thank you See Not so hard is it Thank you
Dont push me
Shh Im right here with you
Whats happening
Im right here with you
Whats wrong with him
The visions take their toll
Hes having one now
I saw Jon Snow
You saw him At Castle Black
He was on the wrong side of the Wall surrounded by enemies
Used to be you couldnt find a tree within a mile of the Wall Crows would come out every morning with axes
Your flock gets smaller every year
You ever climbed it before
No But Tormunds done it half a hundred times Youre afraid
Arent you
Aye Its a long way up and a long way down But Ive waited my whole life to see the world from up there Here sit down
I brought a pair for you Theyre too big for you but theyre good
You kill someone for them
Nah I didnt kill him but I bet his balls are still bruised
He wasnt good to me the way youre good to me He didnt do that thing you do with your tongue
Can we not talk about that here
Can we not talk about that here Im Jon Snow Ive killed dead men and Qhorin Halfhand but Im scared of naked girls
Did I seem scared the other day
You were trembling like a leaf
Only in the beginning
Only in the beginning Youre a proper lover Jon Snow And dont worry Your secrets safe with me
What secret
Do you think Im as dumb as all those girls in silk dresses you knew growing up Youre loyal and youre brave You didnt stop being a crow the day you walked into Mance Rayders tent
But Im your woman now Jon Snow Youre going to be loyal to your woman The Nights Watch dont care if you live or die Mance Rayder dont care if I live or die Were just soldiers in their armies and theres plenty more to carry on if we go down
Its you and me that matters to me and you Dont ever betray me
I wont
Cause Ill cut your pretty cock right off and wear it round my neck
Sink your metal deep and make sure it holds before taking your next step And if you fall dont scream You dont want that to be the last thing she remembers
Joffrey Cersei Ilyn Payne
Youre good Youre not as good as you think you are
Face tits balls I hit em right where I wanted to
Aye but you took your sweet time of it You wont be fighting straw men little lady Show me your position
Keep your elbow high You want your back doing the hard labor Youre holding Never hold
What
Your muscles tense up when you hold Pull the string back to the center of your chin and release Never hold
But I have to aim
Never aim
Never aim
Your eye knows where it wants the arrow to go Trust your eye
Theres someone out there
Thats about far enough
We come as friends
Begging your pardon mlady but well be the judge of that
Valar morghulis
Valar dohaeris I dont see many priestesses of Rhollor in the Riverlands
You are Thoros of Myr
The High Priest gave you a mission Turn King Robert away from his idols and towards the Lord of Light What happened
I failed
You quit you mean The heathen continue to slaughter each other and you continue to get drunk
You worship Him in your way and Ill worship Him in mine Do you speak the common tongue
My friends here dont speak High Valyrian Why are you here my lady
Forgive my manners I dont see many ladies these days
Lucky for the ladies
How many times has the Lord brought him back
Six
Thats not possible
The Lord has smiled upon me
You should not have this power
I have no power I ask the Lord for His favor and He responds as He will
Ive always been a terrible priest Drank too much rum Fucked all the whores in Kings Landing Its a terrible thing to say but by the time I came to Westeros I didnt believe in our Lord I decided that He that all the gods were stories we told the children to make them behave So I wore the robes and every now and then Id recite the prayers but it was just for show A spectacle for the locals Until the Mountain drove a lance through this ones heart I knelt beside his cold body and said the old words Not because I believed in them but he was my friend and he was dead And they were the only words I knew And for the first time in my life the Lord replied Berics eyes opened and I knew the truth Our god is the one true god And all men must serve Him
Youve been to the other side
The other side There is no other side I have been to the darkness my lady He sent you to us for a reason
You have someone He needs
Bodkin point Penetrates plate at 200 yards Can you make em
Yeah nothing tricky about it Just need decent steel
Ill get you the steel
Come on
I dont like that woman
Thats cause youre a girl
What does that have to do with anything
Forgive me lad
What are you doing Let go of him
Tell them to stop Come on He wants to be one of you He wants to join the Brotherhood Stop them
We serve the Lord of Light and the Lord of Light needs this boy
Did the Lord of Light tell you that or did she
Youre not doing this for your god Youre doing it for gold
Were doing it for both girl We cant defend the people without weapons and horses and food And we cant get weapons and horses and food without gold
You told me this was a Brotherhood You told me I could be one of you
You are more than they can ever be Theyre just foot soldiers in the great war You will make kings rise and fall
Youre a witch Youre going to hurt him
I see a darkness in you And in that darkness eyes staring back at me brown eyes blue eyes green eyes Eyes youll shut forever We will meet again
You staring at my ass Jon Snow
Look out
You all right
Just seeing if you can take a hit lad
Sorry Were you sleeping
Wa
Wa  Wa  Water You want some water I wish I had some for you
So lets play a game Which body part do you need the least
Please
Please is not a body part
Ill tell you everything please
But youve already told me everything Remember Your daddy was mean to you The Starks didnt appreciate you One good bit though The Stark boys theyre still alive Wouldnt that be a hunt to remember You failed but Im a better hunter than you
Now how about your little finger You dont use that for much do you No Good Lets start with that
Youve been wondering why youre here Havent you Where you are Who I am Why Im doing this to you So guess If you guess right Ill tell you By the old gods and the new I swear it You win the game if you can figure out who I am and why Im torturing you and I win the game if you beg me to cut off your finger
If I win youll let me go
If you think this has a happy ending you havent been paying attention
Please
You say please again and youll wish you hadnt You first Where are we
The North
Too vague
Deepwood Motte
Terrible guess
Now where
Last Hearth
Do I look like a fucking Umber to you
Karhold
Karhold How did you know that Did you see any banners flying when we came in
No It was just a guess
Very good Lord Theon And who am I
Torrhen Karstark
Hes dead Strangled by the Kingslayer
He was your brother Your father is Lord Rickard Karstark
You swore to tell me if I
Youre right
Lord Rickard Karstark is Robb Starks bannerman I betrayed Robb Thats why youre torturing me
Yes You win
Of course you forgot to ask one question You forgot to ask if Im a liar
Im afraid I am
Everything I told you is a lie
This isnt happening to you for a reason Well one reason I enjoy it
Please cut it off Cut it off Cut it off
I win
Thank you for riding here so quickly I know travel isnt easy in these times
The roads are crawling with cutthroats and bandits But when the King of the North summons us we come
Our father has instructed us to tell you that his alliance with the North can continue if his terms are met Lord Frey requires a formal apology for your violation of your sacred oath to marry one of his daughters
Of course He deserves as much I was in the wrong
As restitution for this betrayal he demands Harrenhal and all its attendant lands
I dont think thats
We are fighting for the North Harrenhal is not in the North It is his once the war is over and we have no further strategic need for it
And theres something else
We will do whatever we can to give Lord Frey what he needs
Not what whom
What
No
Our father requires Lord Edmure to wed one of his daughters Roslin
How old is she
Could I see her first
You want to count her teeth We depart for the Twins in the morning We need an answer before we leave and a wedding not more than a fortnight thereafter or this alliance is at an end
Your father does realize were in the middle of a war
Father is old It will put his heart at peace if he could see her wed to a good husband
And his recent experience has made him wary of long engagements
He has every right to be Please excuse us while we discuss it
Why should I let that old ferret choose my bride for me At the very least I should be offered the same choice you were Im his liege lord
Hes a proud man and weve wounded him
I didnt wound him My answer is no
Listen to me and listen very carefully You
The laws of gods and men are very clear No man can compel another man to marry
The laws of my fist are about to compel your teeth
Its all right You heard him If you refuse our alliance with the Freys is dead
Hes wanted me for one of his daughters since I was 12 Hes not gonna stop wanting it now When I say no he will come back and offer me a daughter of my choosing
Youre willing to risk our freedom and our lives for a chance at a prettier wife
I have a war to fight We cant win it without them I have no time to haggle You said you wanted to make amends for the Stone Mill
You recall that heroic engagement
I had something less permanent in mind
Ive won every battle but Im losing this war If we dont do this and do it now were lost
Ill marry her
Youre paying for my sins Uncle Its not fair or right Ill remember it
I see my men have finally found you something appropriate to wear
Yes Most kind of them Youre a Stark bannerman Lord Bolton I am acting on Lady Starks orders to return Jaime Lannister to Kings Landing
When King Robb left Harrenhal his mother was his prisoner If she wasnt his mother hed have hanged her for treason
I should send you back to Robb Stark
You should But instead youre sitting here watching me fail at dinner Why might that be
Wars cost money Many people would pay a great deal for you
We both know who would pay the most Or make you pay the most if he found out you had captured me and sent me back up north for a summary execution
Youre right Perhaps the safest thing to do is to kill you both and burn your bodies
It would be if you honestly believed my father would never find out about it
King Robb is keeping your father quite busy He doesnt have time for anything else
Hell make time for you
As soon as youre well enough to travel I will allow you to go to Kings Landing as restitution for the mistakes my soldiers made And you will swear to tell your father the truth that I had nothing to do with your maiming
Shall we drink on it
I dont partake
You do understand how suspicious that is to ordinary people
Very well My lady may our journey continue without further incident
Oh she wont be going with you
I am charged with bringing Ser Jaime to
You are charged with abetting treason
Im afraid I must insist
Youre in no place to insist on anything I would have hoped youd learned your lesson about overplaying your position
Impossible
Why
My grandson is the pride of Highgarden The most desirable bachelor in all seven kingdoms Your daughter
Is rich the most beautiful woman in all seven kingdoms and the mother of the king
Old
Old
Old Im something of an expert on the subject Her change will be upon her before long Ill spare you the details of what will happen then You men may have a stomach for bloodshed and slaughter but this is another matter entirely
The years punish us as well I promise you that My stomach remains quite strong however The only thing that might turn it are details of your grandsons nocturnal activities Do you deny them
Oh not at all A sword swallower through and through
And a boy with his affliction should be grateful for the opportunity to marry the most beautiful woman in the kingdoms and remove the stain from his name
Did you grow up with boy cousins Lord Tywin Sons of your fathers bannermen squires stable boys
Of course
And you never
No
Not once Not in any way
Never
I congratulate you upon your restraint But its a natural thing two boys having a go at each other beneath the sheets
Perhaps Highgarden has a high tolerance for unnatural behavior
I wouldnt say that True we dont tie ourselves in knots over a discreet bit of buggery but brothers and sisters where I come from that stain would be very difficult to wash out
I will not breathe further life into a malicious lie by discussing it
Lie or not you must admit many people find it quite convincing Convincing enough to put swords in their hands and send them off to kill Lannisters and Tyrells thanks to our new affiliation
I dont care what people believe And neither do you
As an authority on myself I must disagree
Now if the rumors about my children were true then Joffrey is no king at all and House Tyrell is throwing its prized flower into the dirt
And if Cersei is too old to give Loras children were throwing another prized flower into the dirt It is a chance we simply cannot take
The uncertainty makes you uncomfortable All right Ill remove it for you
If you refuse to marry Loras to Cersei I will name him to the Kingsguard Im sure youre familiar with the Kingsguard vows He will never marry He will never have children
The Tyrell name will fade And Highgarden will go to the children of Joffrey and Margaery
You would have your grandson protected by someone who disgusts you
I would have my grandson protected by a skilled warrior who takes his vows seriously So shall I draw up the order Or do you consent to this marriage
Its a rare enough thing a man who lives up to his reputation
No
Weve gotta cut them loose
No They hang and dangle helplessly far from the wall swinging back and forth ORELL continues to cut through the rope finally swings far enough to plant his axe in solid ice At the same moment ORELL cuts through the rope and YGRITTE plummets limbs spinning Her fall halts when the rope t goes taught
Take my hand
Thats a wonderful pin
Oh its more of a brooch really Though I suppose a brooch is a sort of pin
Im very happy about
Uh yes II am as well
I feel like Im in a dream
Yes me too Definitely Ive dreamed of a large wedding since I was quite young The guests the food the tournaments And the bride of course The most beautiful bride in the world in a beautiful gown of gold and green brocade with fringed sleeves Have you ever been to Highgarden my lady
No I had never left Winterfell before I came to Kings Landing But it sounds wonderful I cant wait to see it And to leave this place
Its terrible isnt it The most terrible place there is
I dont suppose theres anything we can do about this
We can have them both killed
Its hard to say which of the four of us is getting the worst of this arrangement Probably Sansa Though Loras will certainly come to know a deep and singular misery
Father doesnt discriminate Were all being shipped off to hell together
On a boat you built
The Tyrells were plotting to undermine our family I did what I did to protect our family
Im your family A member of your family who has actively contributed to that familys survival Whether or not you or Father or anyone else wants to admit it
I do admit it If it werent for your trick with the wildfire Stannis would have sacked the city before Father got here Our heads would still be rotting on the city gate
Trying to have me killed is an odd way of saying thank you There are two people in Kings Landing who can give an order to a Kingsguard Did you or did you not order Ser Mandon to kill me during the Battle of the Blackwater
The impulse I understand He hates me because Im the only one who tells him what he really is So fair enough He wants me dead But his stupidity He could have had me poisoned and no one would have known But the king orders a Kingsguard to murder the Hand of the King in full view of his own army The boys an idiot
What do you want me to say
I want you to tell me if my life is still in danger
Probably But not from Joffrey He wont do anything now Fathers here
Seven kingdoms united in fear of Tywin Lannister
Not the Tyrells Soon they wont need to be afraid of him Joffrey will belong to Margaery the little doeeyed whore And so will his children and their children History will be taken from our hands
You may escape at least Once Jaime gets back Ser Loras may come down with a terrible case of sword through bowels
When Jaime gets back yes But when do we think thats going to be Hes out there somewhere
Jaime or not Im truly fucked
Whos going to tell her
Do you think people will like it
I dont think they will even notice it
Youre right Its not my wedding Anyway from what I can tell the dressmakers in Highgarden will be far superior to the ones in Kings Landing Theyd never make me anything as dull as this for my wedding Loras likes green and gold brocade
Im sure he does
Will they let me invite my family
They havent asked my opinion
But do you think they will
No
Lady Sansa Lord Tyrion to see you Should I
I beg your pardon my lady
Good afternoon Lord Tyrion I was just trying on a gown for King Joffreys wedding
Yes it should be quite a wedding I need to speak with you Lady Sansa
Of course
Alone if I may
Why do you need to speak to her alone
Shae Please excuse her Lord Tyrion Shes not from here But I trust her even though she tells me not to
Sometimes we think we want to hear something and its only afterwards when its too late that we realize we wished wed heard it under entirely different circumstances
Its all right really
How to begin Its this this this is awkward
1000 blades taken from the hands of Aegons fallen enemies forged in the fiery breath of Balerion the Dread
There arent There arent even 200 Ive counted
Ha Im sure you have Ugly old thing Yet it has a certain appeal The Lysa Arryn of chairs Shame you had to settle for your second choice
Early days my friend It is flattering really you feeling such dread at the prospect of me getting what I want
Thwarting you has never been my primary ambition I promise you Although who doesnt like to see their friends fail now and then
Youre so right For instance when I thwarted your plan to give Sansa Stark to the Tyrells If Im going to be honest I did feel an unmistakable sense of enjoyment there But your confidant the one who fed you information about my plans the one you swore to protect you didnt bring her any enjoyment And she didnt bring me any enjoyment She was a bad investment on my part Luckily I have a friend who wanted to try something new Something daring And he was so grateful to me for providing this fresh experience
I did what I did for the good of the realm
The realm Do you know what the realm is Its the thousand blades of Aegons enemies A story we agree to tell each other over and over till we forget that its a lie
But what do we have left once we abandon the lie Chaos A gaping pit waiting to swallow us all
Chaos isnt a pit Chaos is a ladder
Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again The fall breaks them
How far are we
About a week I think
You think You dont know
When we went to Castle Black we took the kingsroad
You and your roads Is that how you lot do your fighting You march down the road banging drums and waving banners
Most of the time yes
How do the men holding the banners fight
They dont really Its a great honor to carry your house sigil
And the drummers is that a great honor too
Usually its the young boys banging the drums
So what good are they
They help the men march
How
Well its its the rhythm
Oh you mean right foot left foot right foot left foot right foot You need help remembering that When Mance gives the signal and we hit Castle Black we wont be banging on drums to let them know were coming
No No youre just gonna light the biggest fire the North has ever seen to let them know youre coming
You know nothing Jon Snow
Shes right you dont
I know you cut me loose on the Wall
Cut her loose too Do you see her sulking about it Thats because she understands the way things are
And are you gonna share it with me The deep wisdom you found inside the head of a bird
People work together when it suits them Theyre loyal when it suits them They love each other when it suits them And they kill each other when it suits them She knows that you dont Which is why youll never hold onto her
That rain will cost us another day
Frey will wait He knows were coming
Lord Walder is prickly by nature
Prickly That what you call it Might be the least pleasant man Ive ever met
Yes and that is why
Ive seen wet shits I liked better than Walder Frey Apologies Your Grace Spent too many years around lancers and pikemen
Ive spent the last two years nursing wounded men watching them bleed and die Im not afraid of wet shits
Lord Frey will take this delay as a slight
He can take it as he likes Hes getting the wedding he wanted
Hes getting a wedding It was a king he wanted
Edmure is the best match a Frey has had in the history of their house We should all get some sleep
If you dont put some clothes on I cant promise I wont attack you again
Attack Attack
Who are you writing
My mother
Is that Valyrian
Gaaa
Gaaa Say hello for me
Rytsas
Ritsas
That was close enough
Does she know her daughters a queen
Not yet
That will be a surprise I expect
Many surprises for her
How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when youre over there looking like that
Will you come with me one day to Volantis When all this is over
I will
I promise I know shed love to meet you And her grandchild
What now Are you certain
Are you angry with me
Angry Youre my queen
And I have your little prince or princess inside me
Maybe one of each
Dont get greedy
Can you leave the war for one night
I love you Do you hear me I love you
Most men fuck like dogs
No grace no skill A few dozen thrusts and done You need to be patient Give her time Your cock shouldnt go near her till shes slick as a baby seal And then you go inside but slowly Dont jam it in like youre spearing a pig Come on Hey come on
You think he loves you is that it What did he tell you Hes gonna make you his lady and live with you in some castle
No he didnt tell me anything He barely talks
Ive seen you two whispering in the night giggling like a pair of girls
What youre jealous
Of course Im jealous You should be with one of your own
And youre one of my own Ive never heard a kind word from your mouth
You would if you were mine Id tell you that youre beautiful and fierce and wild Id be good to you You love him
Cause hes pretty Is that it You like his pretty hair and his pretty eyes You think pretty is gonna make you happy
Dont touch me
You wont love him so much when you find out what he really is
Growing up at Winterfell all I ever wanted was to escape to come here to the capital See the southern knights and their painted armor and Kings Landing after dark all the candles burning in all those windows Im stupid A stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns
Come on Come walk with me
I remember the first time I saw you in the throne room Id never seen anyone who looked so unhappy I want very much for you to be happy Sansa and so does my grandmother
You would have been happy at Highgarden But women in our position must make the best of our circumstances
How do I make the best of my circumstances I have to marry him
Has Lord Tyrion mistreated you
No
Has he been kind to you
Hes tried
You dont want him though
Hes a Lannister
Far from the worst Lannister wouldnt you say
Im sorry Here I am complaining to you
My son will be king Sons learn from their mothers I plan to teach mine a great deal And your son if Im not mistaken your son might be the Lord of Casterly Rock and the North someday What
My son with him Ill have to well have to
If its the pain youre worried about
Im not afraid of the pain Not after what Joffreys done to me
What is it then Hes rather goodlooking even with the scar Especially with the scar
Hes a dwarf And Loras Loras
Some women like tall men Some like short men Some like hairy men Some like bald men Gentle men rough men ugly men pretty men pretty girls Most women dont know what they like until theyve tried it And sadly so many of us get to try so little before were old and gray Tyrion may surprise you From what Ive heard hes quite experienced
And thats a good thing
It can be Were very complicated you know Pleasing us takes practice
How do you know all this Did your mother teach you
Yes sweet girl My mother taught me
Shes a child
Shes a foot taller than you
A tall child
Whats the youngest youve ever had
Not that young
How much older
Older
Youre a lord shes a lady And a beauty at that I dont see the problem
Shae isnt going to like it
Shae is a whore Are you gonna marry her Eh How did marrying a whore work out for you the first time
I should never have told you about that
You want Shae keep her Wed one and bed the other All you have to do is get a son in the Stark girl Hell be Lord of Winterfell one day You can rule the North in his name Youll have two women and a whole kingdom of your own
Two women to despise me and a whole kingdom to join them
You waste time trying to get people to love you youll end up the most popular dead man in town You want to fuck that Stark girl You just dont want to admit it
I dont pay you to put evil notions in my head The ones already there dont need company
You pay me to kill people who bother you Evil notions come free
Your Grace
Grandfather
You wanted to speak to me
Yes Id like a report on the meetings of my small council
Youre welcome to attend the meetings of your small council Your Grace Any or all of them
Ive been very busy Many important matters require a kings attention
Of course
Youve been holding the council meetings in the Tower of the Hand instead of the small council chamber
I have yes
May I ask why
The Tower of the Hand is where I work To walk from there to here would take time time I could otherwise spend productively
So if I wanted to attend a council meeting I would now have to climb all the stairs in the Tower of the Hand
We could arrange to have you carried
Tell me about the Targaryen girl in the east and her dragons
Where did you hear about this
Is it true
Apparently so
Dont you think we ought to do something about it
When I was Hand of the King under your fathers predecessor the skulls of all the Targaryen dragons were kept in this room The skull of the last of them was right here It was the size of an apple
And the biggest was the size of a carriage
Yes and the creature to whom it belonged died 300 years ago Curiosities on the far side of the world are no threat to us
But how do we know these dragons are just curiosities and not the beasts that brought the whole world to heel
Because we have been told as much by the many experts who serve the realm by counseling the king on matters about which he knows nothing
But I havent been counseled
You are being counseled at this very moment
I should be consulted about such things
From now on I will see to it that you are appropriately consulted on important matters whenever necessary Your Grace
Yunkai The Yellow City
The Yunkish train bed slaves not soldiers We can defeat them
On the field with ease But they wont meet us on the field They have provisions patience and strong walls If theyre wise theyll hide behind those walls and chip away at us man by man
I dont want half my army killed before Ive crossed the Narrow Sea
We dont need Yunkai khaleesi Taking this city will not bring you any closer to Westeros or the Iron Throne
How many slaves are there in Yunkai
200000 if not more
Then we have 200000 reasons to take the city
Send a man to the city gates Tell the slavers I will receive them here and accept their surrender Otherwise Yunkai will suffer the same fate as Astapor
Now comes the noble Razdal mo Eraz of that ancient and honorable house master of men and speaker to savages to offer terms of peace
Noble lord you are in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen Queen of the Andals and the First Men Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
You may approach Sit
Will the noble lord take refreshment
Ancient and glorious is Yunkai Our empire was old before dragons stirred in old Valyria Many an army has broken against our walls You shall find no easy conquest here khaleesi
Good My Unsullied need practice I was told to blood them early
If blood is your desire blood shall flow But why Tis true you have committed savageries in Astapor But the Yunkai are a forgiving and generous people
The wise masters of Yunkai have sent a gift for the silver queen
There is far more than this awaiting you on the deck of your ship
My ship
Yes khaleesi As I said we are a generous people You shall have as many ships as you require
And what do you ask in return
All we ask is that you make use of these ships Sail them back to Westeros where you belong and leave us to conduct our affairs in peace
I have a gift for you as well Your life
My life
And the lives of your wise masters But I also want something in return You will release every slave in Yunkai Every man woman and child shall be given as much food clothing and property as they can carry as payment for their years of servitude Reject this gift and I shall show you no mercy
You are mad We are not Astapor or Qarth We are Yunkai and we have powerful friends Friends who would take great pleasure in destroying you Those who survive we shall enslave once more Perhaps well make a slave of you as well
You swore me safe conduct
I did but my dragons made no promises And you threatened their mother
Take the gold
My gold You gave it to me remember And I shall put it to good use Youd be wise to do the same with my gift to you Now get out
The Yunkish are a proud people They will not bend
And what happens to things that dont bend He said he had powerful friends Who was he talking about
I dont know
Find out
Chains
Solid gold from the mines outside Lannisport Smithed in Casterly Rock
Golden chains
You could buy a ship with these
Do I need a ship
What
Am I going somewhere
Of course youre not going anywhere
So am I invited to your wedding
I didnt ask for this marriage I didnt want it
No Shes a beautiful girl You said so yourself
That doesnt mean that this is duty not desire
Is that what you will tell yourself when you fuck her
I dont have a choice My father
Does not rule the world We can still go across the Narrow Sea
What would I do there Juggle I am a Lannister of Casterly Rock
And Im Shae the funny whore
My feelings for you have not changed I will marry Sansa Stark and do my duty by her
While I empty her chamber pot and lick your cock when youre bored
I swear to you it will not be like that
No What will it be like
I will buy you a good home somewhere in the city You will have fine clothes guards to keep you safe servants Any children we might have will be well provided for
Children You think I want children who can never see their father Who would be killed in their sleep if their grandfather found out about them
Listen Listen to me my lady
Im not your lady
You are Youll always be my lady
Im your whore And when you are tired of fucking me I will be nothing
What happened
Wildfire I should have been here
After all the running and fighting here I am back where I started
Do you miss it
Kings Landing
Your fathers house
Never had a father Never wanted one
Havent you ever wondered where your strength came from Your talent for fighting
Im lowborn As low as can be My mother was a tavern wench
Mine was a slave So was I Bought and sold scourged and branded until the Lord of Light reached down took me in his hand and raised me up
I was born in Flea Bottom
Your blood is noble
Are you saying my father he was some lord or
There Your fathers house
Im just a bastard
The bastard of Robert of the House Baratheon First of His Name King of the Andals and the First Men Why do you think the gold cloaks wanted you There is power in a kings blood
Come sit by the fire child
Not talking eh Thats a first
I dont talk to traitors
I didnt like giving up the boy
But you did You took the gold and you gave him up
The Red God is the one true god Youve seen his power When he commands we obey
Hes not my one true god
No Whos yours
Death
Spotted a Lannister raiding party
How many

How far
Less than a days ride south

Its too far away
The northern woods later
Is that a palace
Its a windmill
Windmill Who built it Some king
Just the men who used to live here
They must have been great builders stacking stones so high
Winterfell has towers three times that size
Im Jon Snow and Im from Winterfell My daddy was a fancy lord and I lived in a tower that touched the clouds
If youre impressed by a windmill youd be swooning if you saw the Great Keep at Winterfell
Whats swooning
Fainting
Whats fainting
When a girl sees blood and collapses
Why would a girl see blood and collapse
Well not all girls are like you
Well girls see more blood than boys Or do you like girls who swoon Jon Snow Oh a spider Save me Jon Snow
My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday
Id like to see you in a silk dress
Would you
So I could tear it off you
Well you rip my pretty silk dress Ill blacken your eye
Maybe one day Ill take you to Winterfell
Or maybe one day Ill take you there After weve taken our land back
Ygritte You wont win I know your people are brave no one denies that
You know nothing
Six times in the last thousand years a King has attacked the kingdoms Six times they failed
And how do you know that
Every boy in the North knows it We grow up learning it Where the battles were fought the names of the heroes who died where Six times youve invaded and six times youve failed The seventh will be the same
Mance is different
You dont have the discipline You dont have the training Your army is no army You dont know how to fight together
You dont know that
I do I know it If you attack the Wall youll die All of you
All of us
Youre mine as Im yours And if we die we die But first well live
Yes first well live
Whats he going on about And how come he always gets to sit and chat while we do all the work
Hodor
Thats where we are
What are you telling him
Its all right Osha
Its not all right You think I cant hear you every day Filling his head with black magic Talking about visions and threeeyed ravens and worse
Leave him alone
He can speak for himself
I dont fill his head with anything
So what do you talk about
Whats happening to him and what that means
Go on then Tell us what it means
Its not like that I wish I could tell him all the answers It would be much easier
I dont want you talking to him anymore Until we get to your brother at Castle Black
Were not going to Castle Black
What did you say
I told you already Jon Snow isnt there Bran needs to find the raven beyond the Wall
Oh no Im not going back there Your brother is at Castle Black Thats where were going Look at me
The ravens been coming to me ever since I fell from that tower He wants me to find him I dont have my legs anymore This is what I have now
You have a family You need to go back to Castle Black so you can get back to them where you belong
What if I belong in the North What if I fell from that tower for a reason
Is that what hes telling you That its all for a reason All these bad things happened because the gods got big plans for you I wish it were true little lord But the gods wouldnt spare a ravens cold shit for you or me or anyone
You dont understand You dont know
You dont know None of you know None of you have been up there I had a man once A good man Bruni his name was I was his and he was mine But one night Bruni disappears People said he left me but I knew him Hed never leave me Not for long
I knew hed come back And he did He came in through the back of the hut Only it wasnt Bruni Not really His skin was pale like a dead mans His eyes bluer than clear sky He came at me grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me I dont know how I got the knife When I did I stuck it deep into his heart And he hardly seemed to notice I had to burn our hut down with him inside I didnt ask the gods what it meant I didnt need to I already knew It meant the North was no place for men to be Not anymore I promised your maester Id get you to Castle Black and no further
How is the pain my lord
Whats the purpose of an arm with no hand
Well weve stymied the corruption
Yes weve stymied the corruption Youre a learned man
All the good its done me
You did well sewing up this mess Youre far better at this sort of work than Grand Maester Pycelle
Faint praise my lord
So why did the Citadel take your chain Did you fondle one boy too many
No my lord Thats not my weakness
What is
Curiosity The only way to treat disease is to understand disease And the only way to understand it is to study the afflicted
You performed experiments on living men
On dying men
With their permission
My studies have given me insight that has saved many lives
Dying paupers I assume Men with no families to complain You found them moaning in the poorhouse and had them carted back to your garret and opened up their bellies to see what was inside
How many men have you killed my lord
I dont know
50 100
Countless
Countless has a nice ring to it
And how many lives have you saved
Half a million The population of Kings Landing You were in charge of the ravens at Harrenhal Did you did you get a bird off to Briennes father in Tarth
A bird flew off and a bird flew back Lord Selwyn Tarth offered 300 gold dragons for his daughters safe return
A fair offer
A fair offer Locke wont take it
Why not
Hes convinced Lord Tarth owns all the sapphire mines in Westeros
He feels hes being cheated
Theyd be fools to kill her
These men have been at war a long time Most of them will be dead by winter Shell be their entertainment tonight Beyond tonight I dont think they care very much
We have to return to Harrenhal
Why
Ive left something behind
Absolutely not Ive got orders from Lord Bolton
And what are those orders
To deliver you to your father at Kings Landing
You think youll get a reward
I serve Lord Bolton Any appreciation your father
You think youre getting a reward Let me explain something to you When my father sees me the first thing hes going to ask is what happened to my hand And Im going to tell him this man chopped it off
I had nothing
Or I could tell him this man saved my life We return to Harrenhal now
Whoa
Eyes open lads
Be quiet
The bear the bear and the maiden fair  From there to here from here to there All black and brown and covered in hair He smelled that girl in the summer air The bear the bear and the maiden fair
Dont spare her Dont spare her
Well this is one shameful fucking performance Stop running and fight
A wooden sword
I thought youd gone
You gave her a wooden sword
Weve only got one bear
Ill pay her bloody ransom Gold sapphires whatever you want Just get her out of there
All you lords and ladies still think that the only thing that matters is gold
This makes me happier than all your gold ever could And that makes me happier than all her sapphires So go buy yourself a golden hand and fuck yourself with it
Ah
Get behind me
I will not
What the fuck are you doing to my bear
Lord Bolton charged me with bringing him back to Kings Landing alive and thats what I aim to do
Pull her up
Hold my legs
Pull him up
The bitch stays
Were taking her to Kings Landing Unless you kill me
She belongs to me Lord Boltons orders
What do you think is more important to Lord Bolton Getting his pet rat a reward or ensuring Tywin Lannister gets his son back alive
Ill give you one try girl
Kill me and youre free But if I live Ill break both your hands Go on hit me Hit me hard
Sulk all you want The truth is youre lucky You dont want to be alone out here girl Someone worse than me would find you
Theres no one worse than you
Ha you never knew my brother He once killed a man for snoring Theres plenty worse than me Theres men who like to beat little girls men who like to rape them I saved your sister from some of them
Youre lying
Ask her if you ever see her again Ask her who came back for her when the mob had her on her back They would have taken her every which way and left her there with her throat cut open
Is that the Blackwater
The Blackwater Where do you think Im taking you
Back to Kings Landing to Joffrey and the queen
Fuck Joffrey Fuck the queen Thats the Red Fork Im taking you to the Twins
But why
Because your mother and brother will be there and theyll pay me for you
Why would they be at the Twins
Those outlaws you love so much never told you The whole countryside is yapping about it Your uncle is marrying one of the Frey girls So quit trying to bash my skull in and we might just make it there in time for the wedding
Men who fight for gold have neither honor nor loyalty They cannot be trusted
They can be trusted to kill you if theyre well paid The Yunkish are paying them well
You know these men
Only by the broken swords on their banners Theyre called the Second Sons A company led by a Braavosi named Mero The Titans Bastard
Is he more titan or bastard
Hes a dangerous man khaleesi They all are
How many
2000 Your Grace Armored and mounted
Enough to make a difference
Its hard to collect wages from a corpse Im sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side
I imagine youre right
Id like to talk to the Titans Bastard about winning
He may not agree to meet
He will A man who fights for gold cant afford to lose to a girl
Your Grace allow me to present the captains of the Second Sons Mero of Braavos Prendahl na Ghezn and
Daario Naharis
You are the Mother of Dragons I swear I fucked you once in a pleasure house in Lys
Mind your tongue
Why I didnt mind hers She licked my ass like she was born to do it
You slave girl bring wine
We have no slaves here
Youll all be slaves after the battle unless I save you Take your clothes off and come and sit on Meros lap and I may give you my Second Sons
Give me your Second Sons and I may not have you gelded Ser Barristan how many men fight for the Second Sons
Under 2000 Your Grace
We have more dont we
10000 Unsullied
Im only a young girl new to the ways of war but perhaps a seasoned captain like yourself can explain to me how you propose to defeat us
I hope the old man is better with a sword than he is with a lie You have 8000 Unsullied
Youre very young to be a captain
Hes not a captain Hes a lieutenant
Even if your numbers are right you must admit the odds dont favor your side
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and won
The Second Sons have faced worse odds and run
Or you could fight for me
Weve taken the slavers gold We fight for Yunkai
I would pay you as much and more
Our contract is our bond If we break our bond no one will hire the Second Sons again
Ride with me and youll never need another contract Youll have gold and castles and lordships of your choosing when I take back the Seven Kingdoms
You have no ships You have no siege weapons You have no cavalry
A fortnight ago I had no army A year ago I had no dragons You have two days to decide
Show me your cunt I want to see if its worth fighting for
My Queen shall I slice out his tongue for you
These men are our guests You seem to be enjoying my wine Perhaps youd like a flagon to help you ponder
Only a flagon And what are my brothers in arms to drink
A barrel then
Good The Titans Bastard does not drink alone In the Second Sons we share everything After the battle maybe well all share you
Ill come looking for you when this is over
Ser Barristan if it comes to battle kill that one first
Gladly Your Grace
Half Robert half lowborn
Show the boy to his chambers Have the maids draw him a bath and find him some decent clothes Ill come visit you soon
What do you mean to do with him
You know what I mean to do with him
Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes If it needs to be done do it Dont torture the boy
Have you ever slaughtered a lamb my king
No
If the lamb sees the knife she panics Her panic seeps into her meat darkens it fouls the flavor
Youve slaughtered many lambs
And none have seen the blade
And tho and thowg Vvvisenya Targaryen rod rode Vhagar Vhag Fuck me Visenya Targaryen rode Vhagar the smallest of the dragons though still large enog enough enough to swallow a horse whole
Your Grace
They feeding you enough
Two meals a day Cold for breakfast hot for supper I cannot complain
You dont belong in a place like this
Well its sad to say but Ive seen worse
Yeah
Im sorry about your son Didnt get the chance to tell you before Good lad Loyal lad
Melisandres returned
I didnt know shed been gone
Came back with a bastard boy Roberts bastard boy
Why
She says theres power in kings blood
Shes going to kill him
Sacrifice him
Forgive me Your Grace Im not a learned man but is there a difference between kill and sacrifice The boy is your nephew
What of it Were at war Why should I spare the son of some tavern slut Robert bedded one drunken night
Because he has your blood in his veins
So did Renly
Renly wronged you Renly declared himself king when the throne belonged to you He raised an army stole your bannermen This boy has done you no harm Hes an innocent
How many boys live in Westeros How many girls How many men How many womenThe darkness will devour them all she says The night that never ends Unless I triumph I never asked for this No more than I asked to be king We do not choose our destiny but we must do our duty no Great or small we must do our duty Whats one bastard boy against a kingdom
Your Grace why did you come to see me today
I came to free you If you swear never to raise your hand to the Lady Melisandre again
I swear it I cant swear never to speak against her
You have little regard for your own life
Quite little Your Grace Verging on none You could have freed me yesterday or tomorrow but you came to me now before this boy is put to the knife because you knew Id counsel restraint You came to hear me say it because you believe it yourself Youre not a man who slaughters innocents for gain or glory When my son was five he said to me I dont ever want to die I wanted to say to him You wont child You wont ever I hated the idea of him lying awake in the dark afraid I think mothers and fathers made up the gods because they wanted their children to sleep through the night
I saw a vision in the flames A great battle in the snow I saw it And you saw whatever she gave birth to I never believed but when you see the truth when its right there in front of you as real as these iron bars how can you deny her god is real
Little dragon bitch She talks too much
You talk too much
She wont talk so much when shes choking on my cock
8000 unsullied stand between her and your cock
My cock will find a way Tell him Is there any place that my cock cant reach
Shell tell me whatever you pay her to tell me
Daario Naharis the whore who doesnt like whores
I like them very much I just refuse to pay them And Im no whore my friend
She sells her sheath and you sell your blade Whats the difference
I fight for beauty
For beauty
We fight for gold
The gods gave men two gifts to entertain ourselves before we die the thrill of fucking a woman who wants to be fucked and the thrill of killing a man who wants to kill you
Youll die young
What do we do about the dragon girl We cant beat 8000 Unsullied on the battlefield
There wont be a battle And we dont have to deal with her eunuchs We only have to deal with her
Shes well guarded
Tonights a new moon One of us slips into her camp past her Unsullied and her knights
Which one of us
Close your eyes love
Three coins A coin from Meereen a coin from Volantis and a coin from Braavos The Braavosi does the deed One for each of us darling No peeking
Do you hear me Follow my voice Im right here
You have something for me
Valar morghulis
Lady Sansa
You look very handsome my lord
Oh yes The husband of your dreams But you do look glorious Perhaps we could have a moment alone Do you mind Podrick could you escort Lady Starks handmaiden
My lady I want you to know I didnt ask for this
I hope I will not disappoint you my lord
No dont You dont have to speak to me as a prisoner anymore You wont be a prisoner after today Youll be my wife I suppose thats a different kind of prison I just wanted to say Im just trying to say very badly I just just want to say I know how you feel
I doubt that very much my lord
Youre right I have no idea how you feel And you have no idea how I feel
But I promise you one thing my lady I wont ever hurt you Do you drink wine
When I have to
Well today you have to
You look radiant Your Grace
Radiant Why radiant
Its the word that came to mind
Were going to be sisters soon We should be friends
Youre a musical girl arent you I imagine you have a lovely voice
A better dancer than a singer Im afraid
Ah but you know the song The Rains of Castamere
Of course They play it so often here at court
So you know the story of House Reyne of Castamere
Not as well as you Im sure
House Reyne was a powerful family Very wealthy The second wealthiest in Westeros Arent the Tyrells the second wealthiest family in Westeros now
Of course ambitious climbers dont want to stop on the second highest rung If only you could take that final step youd see further than all the rest Youd be alone with nothing but blue sky above you So Lord Reyne built a castle as grand as Casterly Rock He gave his wife diamonds larger than any my mother ever wore And finally one day he rebelled against my father Do you know where House Reyne is now
Gone
Gone A gentle word Why not say slaughtered Every man woman and child put to the sword
I remember seeing their bodies hanging high above the gates of Casterly Rock My father let them rot up there all summer It was a long summer And now the rains weep oer their halls and not a soul to hear
If you ever call me sister again Ill have you strangled in your sleep
What are you doing
Your fathers gone As the father of the realm it is my duty to give you away to your husband
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
Could you
Thank you
Your Grace Your Grace my lords my ladies we stand here in the sight of gods and men to witness the union of man and wife One flesh one heart one soul now and forever
Have you ever seen one like it
Ive never seen anything like any of this Not in my life
Its shocking isnt it the first time you encounter real wealth When I was your age I lived on one bowl of stew a day And stew is a kind word for it
In Flea Bottom we called them bowls of brown Wed pretend that the meat in them was chicken We knew it wasnt chicken
Here taste this
You think Im trying to poison you
Thats good
Thats really good
Where do you think its from
I couldnt even guess
Doesnt matter does it Its the real thing or its not You only need a tongue to tell the difference Go on have some more You still dont trust it You think this is all a mistake and that youll have to pay somehow for every bite you take
That thought had crossed my mind yeah
There are no mistakes Not for us
Im a mistake Im only here because my father grabbed my mother instead of the girl next to her in the tavern
Your father chose your mother because the Lord of Light willed it He willed it so you could be here right now with a power inside you you cant even begin to understand And He brought me here to draw it from you and birth it into the world Were both a part of His plan He wants this for us No He demands this of us
I dont understand This this doesnt seem very religious
According to whom The Silent Sisters With their stern looks muzzled mouths and driedup cunts What have their gods done for you Hmm When you pray to them whats their answer A god is real or hes not You only need eyes to see
Death is coming for everyone and everything A darkness that will swallow the dawn And we can stop it you and I
Let me show you what you have inside you Come fight death with me
What are you doing
You have to trust me
What  Get it away Get it off me
Dont fight dont fight They wont take much
Why are you doing this
I told you theres power in the blood of kings And you have so much blood
No No no no no Not there Not there
You can blame Ser Davos He didnt believe in the power of kings blood He wanted a demonstration
Please Please Your Grace My lord
The usurper Robb Stark The usurper Balon Greyjoy The usurper Joffrey Baratheon JOFFREY and CERSEI sit amist the festivities drinking wine and chatting TYWIN sits to their left stoic At the head table TYRION carefully fills his wine glass right to the brim He smacks his lips and looks over to SANSA who is disgusted with him The Tyrells sit across the hall from the Lannisters speaks with amusement to LORAS and MARGAERY
So their son will be your nephew After youre wed to Cersei of course And you will be the kings stepfather and brotherinlaw When you marry the king Joffreys mother will become his sisterinlaw and your son will be Loras nephew Grandson Im not sure But your brother will become your fatherinlaw That much is beyond dispute
Will you pardon me my lord
Of course Of course En enjoy
Perhaps you could talk to your bridetobe instead
Ive got a lifetime for that
Stay
You seem rather drunk
Rather less than I plan to be Isnt it a mans duty to be drunk at his own wedding
This isnt about your wedding Renly Baratheon had a wedding Your wife needs a child a Lannister child as soon as possible
And
If youre going to give her one you need to perform
What did you once call me A drunken little lustfilled beast
More than once
There you have it Nothing to worry about Drinking and lust no man can match me in these things I am the god of tits and wine I shall build a shrine to myself at the next brothel I visit
You can drink you can joke you can engage in juvenile attempts to make your father uncomfortable but you will do your duty
Well my father once told me
Nobody cares what your father once told you
Congratulations my lady
Thank you Your Grace
Well youve done it Youve married a Lannister Soon youll have a Lannister baby Its a dream come true for you isnt it What a glorious day
Yes Your Grace
I suppose it doesnt really matter which Lannister puts the baby into you Maybe Ill pay you a visit tonight after my uncle passes out Howd you like that
You wouldnt Thats all right Ser Meryn and Ser Boros will hold you down
Time for the bedding ceremony
There will be no bedding ceremony
Wheres your respect for tradition Uncle Come everyone Pick her up and carry her to her wedding bed Get rid of her gown She wont be needing it any longer Ladies attend to my uncle Hes not heavy
There will be no bedding ceremony
There will be if I command it
Then youll be fucking your own bride with a wooden cock
What did you say What did you say
I believe we can dispense with the bedding Your Grace Im sure Tyrion did not mean to threaten the king
A bad joke Your Grace Made out of envy of your own royal manhood Mine is so small My poor wife wont even know Im there
Your uncle is clearly quite drunk Your Grace
I am Guilty But but it is my wedding night
My tiny drunk cock and I have a job to do Come wife
I vomited on a girl once in the middle of the act Not proud of it But I think honesty is important between a man and wife dont you agree Come Ill tell you all about it Put you in the mood
Is that wise my lord
Tyrion Sansa My name is Tyrion
Is that wise Tyrion
Nothing was ever wiser
Astoundingly long
What
Neck You have one How old are you exactly
Well talk wont make you any older My lord father has commanded me to consummate this marriage
Stop I cant I could I wont
But your father
If my father wants someone to get fucked I know where he can start I wont share your bed Not until you want me to
What if I never want you to
And so my watch begins
Yes Your Grace
How can anyone speak 19 languages
It only took Your Grace a year to learn Dothraki reasonably well
Yes well it was either learn Dothraki or grunt at my husband and hope what do you mean reasonably well
Dothraki is difficult for the mouth to master So guttural and harsh
Drogo said I spoke Dothroaki like one born to it It gave him great pride
Athjahakar
Athjahaka
Athjahakar
Athjahakar
Well I suppose Im a bit out of practice
Your High Valyrian is very good Your Grace The gods could not devise a more perfect tongue It is the only proper language for poetry
No screaming or she dies
What do you want
You
Let her go
Dont scream lovely girl
You were sent here to kill me
So why havent you
I dont want to
What do your captains have to say about that
You should ask them
Why
We had philosophical differences
Over what
Your beauty It meant more to me than it did to them
Youre a strange man
Im the simplest man youll ever meet I only do what I want to do
And this is supposed to impress me
Yes
Why would I trust a man who murders his comrades
They ordered me to murder you I told them I preferred not to They told me I had no choice I told them I am Daario Naharis I always have a choice They drew their swords and I drew mine
Will you fight for me
Swear to me
The Second Sons are yours and so is Daario Naharis My sword is yours my life is yours my heart is yours
You really ought to knock
I brought your breakfast
Its getting dark We could stay here for the night
How hard can it be to build a fire
It doesnt matter Come under the furs We can keep each other warm
He winked at me before
I doubt it
I saw him wink at me
He blinked
I suppose its a rather philosophical difference between a wink and a blink
A what
Well I mean theres no real difference
A wink is on purpose
You thought of a name yet It would be easier to refer to him if he had a name
Sometimes do you talk fancy on purpose to confuse me
What No This is just the way I talk
Ill build that fire
Dont you think he should have a name
I dont know many boys names
Lets see theres Duncan Kevan Jon Guymon Feldan Tristifer
Craster
Uh yes Maybe thats not
Mormont
Thats a lovely idea but Mormonts a last name
Why is it a last name
Well its a family name For instance Im Samwell Tarly Samwell is my birth name and Tarly is my family name You see So my father is also a Tarly
His name is Samwell Tarly too
No Randyll Tarly
Randyll is a handsome name
Please dont name him Randyll
Is your father cruel like mine
Different manner of cruel
Not Randyll then
Dont Dont go out there
Ill be back I just want to look
Go inside Go back inside Ill
Its come for the baby
Stay back
You stay back
No you cant have him No
No
Are you sure about this
No
Its dangerous
If we take Tywins castle from him the lords of Westeros will realize hes not invincible Take his home take his gold take his power
Why are you telling me
You begged me not to send Theon to negotiate with his father and I ignored your advice
Now Winterfell is burned to the ground The North is overrun with Ironborn and Bran and Rickon are gone
So Casterly Rock Im asking your advice
We have enough men
If reinforcements arrive from Kings Landing before we take the castle well be caught between Tywins army and the sea
Well lose the war and die the way father died Or worse
Show them how it feels to lose what they loveThe next scene shows ROBBS direwolf Grey Wind as he leads House Starks army to The Twins castle the ancestral seat of House Frey
My honored guests be welcome within my walls and at my table I extend to you my hospitality and protection in the light of the Seven
We thank you for your hospitality my lord
I have come to make my apologies my lord and to beg your forgiveness
Dont beg my forgiveness your Grace It wasnt me you spurned it was my girls
One of them was supposed to be queen now none of them are
This is Arwyn my daughter My daughter Walda my daughter Derwa my daughter Waldra
My eldest granddaughters Ginia and Neila
Serra and Sarra granddaughters twins You could have had either Could have had both for all I care
My granddaughter Marianne My granddaughter Freya My granddaughter WWWertha Waldra Waldina
Im Merry
Fine And heres my youngest daughter Shirei though she hasnt bled yet Clearly you dont have the patience for all that
My ladies All men should keep their word kings most of all I was pledged to marry one of you and I broke that vow The fault is not with you Any man would be lucky to have any one of you I did what I did not to slight you but because I loved another I know these words cannot set right the wrong I have done to you and your house I beg your forgiveness and pledge to do all I can to make amends so the Freys of the Crossing and the Starks of Winterfell may once again be friends
Very good
There she is Come closer let me have a look at you
Still cant see you Old eyes
Love Thats what the Starks of Winterfell call it eh Heh Very honorable I call it a pretty face Mmmm very pretty Prettier than this lot thats for sure Very shapely as well Oh you try to hide her under that dress If you wanted to hide her you shouldnt have brought her here in the first place
I can always see whats going on beneath a dress Been at this a long time I bet when you take that dress off everything stays right where it is Doesnt drop an inch
Your king says he betrayed me for love I say he betrayed me for firm tits and a tight fit
And I can respect that When I was your age Id have broken fifty oaths to get into that without a second thought Well Ive enough room in the hall for you lot Well set up tents outside with food and ale for the rest of your men
Thank you my lord
Well lets get ready The wine will flow red and the music will play loud and well put this mess behind us 
Where
There
There its a back gate My men use it when they visit Yunkais bed slaves
Your men but not you
I have no interest in slaves A man cannot make love to property
This is where we enter the city Very few guards they know me They let me inside
Were not gonna sneak an army through a back gate
I kill the guards I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets which I know well and open the front gates
Then comes the army Once the walls are breached the city will fall in hours
Or perhaps youll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter cutting the head off our army The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you wont have to split it three ways cause youve already slaughtered your partners
You have a very suspicious mind In my experience only dishonest people think this way
You command the Unsullied What do you think
Lo jention mirre numazme eza iderenna qopsa verdagon issa
I trust him
You leave tonight
Very good Well prepare
Ser Jorah You can use an extra sword
Youre the Queensguard Ser Barristan Your place is by the Queen If we are truly her loyal servants well do whatever needs to be done No matter the cost no matter our pride 
Were west of Castle Black but the Nightforts closest to us It was the first castle on the Wall The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I Too big impossible to maintain Other than Castle Black itself the Nightforts the perfect castle for us Its got a secret sally port the Black Gate as old as the Wall itself No ones used it for centuries most likely It leads through the Wall right down into the Nightfort if no one knows how to find it which it just so happens I do
How do you know all that
I read about it in a very old book
You know all that from staring at marks on paper
Yes
Youre like a wizard
Our father used to tell us that no wildling ever looked upon the Wall and lived Here we are Alive 
Remember what happens to children who run Im your father and Ill do the talking
The roads have gone right to hell havent they Cracked three spokes this morning
Need a hand
Need about eight hands
Got to get this salt pork to The Twins in time for the wedding
Many thanks
Dont Dont kill him
Dead rats dont squeak
Youre so dangerous arent you Saying scary things to little girls Killing little boys and old people A real hard man you are
More than anyone you know
Youre wrong I know a killer A real killer
That so
Youd be like a kitten to him Hed kill you with his little finger
That him
No
Good
Dont kill him Please Please dont
Youre very kind Someday itll get you killed 
Where are we
The Gift I think Brandon The Builder gave all this land south of the Wall to the Nights Watch for their sustenance and support Maester Luwin taught me that
Doesnt seem to be supporting anyone at the moment
Its good land and theres no war up here Why leave
Wildlings
Sorry But they come over the Wall and raid steal carry off women
Old Nan said they turn your skull into a cup and make you drink your own blood from it
Thats what Old Nan said
Theres a storm coming
I dont see any
Its as good a place to shelter as any
We can drink some blood while we wait I dont need much 
Only one old man and eight good horses
Whats one old man doing with eight horses
He breeds them for the Watch
Hows he keep folks from stealing them
The Watch protects him
Not today they dont Hes selling horses hes got some gold in there
And proper steel
Lets carve him up
We just take the horses and go The old mans no threat
I keep telling you
Hes an old man A spear through the hearts a better way to die than coughing up your last with no one but your horses to hear
The Watch might send a few men looking for a horse thief Theyll send a lot more to hunt down murderers
I hope so Killing crows in their castle is tough Killing them out here in the open thats what we do
Spread out Surround the hut and move in
Ygritte
Clear the barn 
No ones going to believe youre a hog farmer if you eat them all
Best part of the animal
Dont worry theyre still there
I know theyre still there
You check every five minutes like youre afraid theyre gonna move
Im not afraid
Of course you are Youre almost there and youre afraid you wont make it The closer you get the worse the fear gets No point in trying to hide behind that face I know fear when I see it Seen it a lot
I knew fear when I saw it in you Youre afraid of fire
When Berics sword went up in flames you looked like a scared little girl
And I know why too I heard what your brother did to you Pressed your face to the fire like youre a nice juicy mutton chop
That give you some ideas
Might do
Go ahead then You might get away Might even make it there on your own Theyre just over the river The closest youve been to family since Ilyn Payne snipped your daddys neck
Someday Im gonna put a sword through your eye and out the back of your skull 
How are we going to get past the Wall My uncle said its 700 feet high
How did you get past it
Got in a boat and rowed past the Bay of Seals
It would take us two months to get to the Bay of Seals
Some climb straight up the ice
Even Hodors not strong enough to climb the Wall with me on his back
Hodor
Nineteen castles guard the Wall Only three are still manned
Hodor
One of those abandoned fortresses will give us a way through
My uncle said the gates were sealed with ice and stone when the castles were deserted
Well well have to open them up again
Whoa whoa whoa
Theres a rider out there
Just one
Theres more
Hodor
Its just thunder sweet giant
Hodor
I yield I yield
Wildlings
Wheres Shaggydog and Summer
Hunting
Hodor
Shhh quiet Hodor
Hodor
Make him shut up If they hear us
Hush Hodor No no more Hodoring
Hodor
Hodor calm down
You need to keep quiet
Theyre gonna hear us
Hodor be quiet
Hodor calm down Hodor be quiet
What did you do
Nothing I dont know
Whats That
Thats a horse dying
Bring them over here
That was the last of them The rest are dead
I heard shouting up there
Thunder
I know the difference between shouting and thunder
Maybe its ghosts
That wont help you grandpa
Where you riding
Doesnt matter now does it
No it doesnt matter now
Cut his throat or hell tell the crows were here
You understand
Let me stand at least
Let me go with a bit of dignity
Make the crow kill him Youre one of us now Prove it
The wolves are out there
I cant do it by choice I dont know how It happens in my dreams
Youre a warg Bran Its in your blood
I cant
You just did with him
A wolf is nothing compared to that
She looks sharp
Do it Do it
Told ya Hes still one of them
Go on boy
Go on
Hes a crow Hell always be a crow And heres his crow wife guarding him Hell stab us in the back first chance he gets
Kill him
Hes one of them
No
Do you hear me
Youre not gonna die for one of them
Do it Theyll find us if you dont
You were right the whole time 
When you hear a songbirds whistle you come Im a great whistler the greatest in the land
Daario Naharis
That one was quick
There may be others
I doubt it The Yunkish prefer to let their slaves do their fighting for them
Thats what you call a few guards 
Lord Edmure I hope Im not a disappointment to you
Youre a delight to me my lady
You may now cloak the bride and bring her under your protection
In the sight of the Seven I hereby seal these two souls binding them as one for eternity Look upon each other and say the wordsEDMURE
Father Smith Warrior Mother Maiden Crone Stranger I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days 
Is that safe
Theyre long gone
You were right I can get inside Summers mind whenever I want
Of course you can North of the Wall there are wildlings who can control all sorts of animals But you did a lot more than that You got inside Hodors mind
They cant do that north of the Wall
No one can do that Anywhere
When I was looking through Summers eyes I saw Jon
Where
He was with the wildlings They tried to kill him but he got away
Hell be heading back to Castle Black then Thats where we should go
For all we know Castle Blacks already under attack If this many wildlings got through
I already told you Im not going north of the Wall
Everything Jojen told me is true You saw what I did to Hodor I have to find the threeeyed raven
Listen to me little lord
Dont worry Im not asking you to come with me It wont be safe for Rickon
Me Im coming with you
No You and Osha and Shaggydog head for the Last Hearth The Umbers are our bannermen Theyll protect you
Im coming with you Im your brother I have to protect you
Right now I have to protect you
Robbs at war and Im going beyond the Wall If something happens to us youre the heir to Winterfell
Will you know how to find the last Hearth
You Southerners build your big castles and you never move Youre easy to find
Were not Southerners
And I dont want to leave you
Shhh Come here little soldier You and me were gonna have some adventures
You dont have to do any of this
Your family took me in and was good to me when they had no cause to be Shhh Well be fine you and me The Umbers are great warriors Even I heard about them growing up Theyll teach you how to swing a sword
I know how to swing a sword
Youre leaving now Its the middle of the night
I learned to walk in darkness
Say your goodbyes little man
Keep this one safe He means the world to me 
Weve been waiting a long time Havent we Well I dont know you tell me How long does it take to sack a city
It was just as you said They did not believe until it was too late Their slave soldiers threw down their spears and surrendered
And Daario Naharis
The city is yours my queen 
Theyre good arent they
They ought to be because they cost enough
Look at the crowd there
He complained about this marriage the entire ride from Riverrun and now look at him
The Gods love to reward a fool
Uncle
What Hes my nephew I love him And hes a damned fool
Dont you drink Lord Bolton
Never do my lady Dulls the senses
Thats the point Didnt you marry one of these Frey girls
Aye Lord Walder let me choose any of his granddaughters and promised me the girls weight in silver as a dowry So I have a fat young bride
I hope she makes you very happy
Well shes made me very rich
Pardon my lord my lady I need to find a tree to piss on
My mothers alone with Roose Bolton I should rescue her
Your mother is less in need of rescue than any woman Ive ever met
Be kind Shes finally starting to like you
And I like her But if she had her way I would be back in Volantis playing my harp and you would be sitting over there  eating blackberries out of Roslin Freys hand
Perhaps Ive made a terrible mistake
Striking your king is an act of treason
No dont Dont insult them
Your Grace
The Septon has prayed his prayers some words were said and Lord Edmure has wrapped my daughter in a cloak But they are not yet man and wife A sword needs a sheath And a wedding needs a bedding What does my sire say
To bed To bed To bed
If you think the time is right Lord Walder by all means let us bed them
To bed To bed To bed
Hoho Careful now ladies Once you set that monster free theres no caging him again
To bed To bed To bed
Poor girl
Every bride suffers the same Im sure you endured yours with grace
Oh Ned forbade it He said it wouldnt be right if he broke a mans jaw on our wedding night
That is a very strange custom
I suppose it does seem strange from a foreigners perspective
It seems normal to you
Its tradition Without the bedding ceremony theres no real proof the lord and lady consummated their marriage
No but there are other ways of providing proof
Boy or girl
I dont know But if its a boy I know what we should name him
Oh do you It seems to me the father should have some say in his sons naming
Eddard Dont you want to teach little Ned Stark how to ride horses
I do
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Where are you going
Got salt pork for the feast
The feast is over
It doesnt sound like its over
If I tell you its over its over Turn this cart around and get the hell out of here
Got pigs feet too
Are you soft in the head Turn this cart around
Your Grace
I feel Ive been remiss in my duties
Ive given you meat and wine and music but I havent shown you the hospitality you deserve My king has married and I owe my new queen a wedding gift
Robb
You ready to head home to Winterfell eh
Feast over yet is it
Aye its over
Its too late
ing in the North arises heh heh
Lord Walder Lord Walder enough Let it end Please He is my son My first son Let him go and I swear that we will forget this I swear it by the Old Gods and New We will take no vengeance
You already swore me one oath right here in my castle You swore by all the Gods your son would marry my daughter
Take me for a hostage but let Robb go Robb get up Get up and walk out Please Please
And why I would let him do that
On my honor as a Tully on my honor as a Stark let him go or I will cut your wifes throat
Ill find another
Mother
Its too late
Yah Yah
Go move out
ing in the North ing in the North he King in the North ing in the North
ing in the North ing in the North
Here comes the King in the North Here comes the King in the North
ing in the North ing in the North
Here comes
Hmm Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall
What are you doing
I have a list
A list of people you mean to kill
For laughing at me Do I look like Joffrey to you No death seems a bit extreme Fear of death on the other hand
You should learn to ignore them
My lady people have been laughing at me far longer than theyve been laughing at you Im the Halfman the Demon Monkey the Imp
Youre a Lannister I am the disgraced daughter of the traitor Ned Stark
The disgraced daughter and the Demon Monkey Were perfect for each other
So how should we punish them
Who Whom
Ser Eldrick Sarsfield and Lord Desmond Crakehall
Ah I could speak to Lord Varys and learn their perversions Anyone named Desmond Crakehall must be a pervert
I hear that youre a pervert
I am the Imp I have certain standards to maintain
We could sheep shift Lord Desmonds bed You cut a little hole in his mattress and you stuff sheep dung inside Then you sew up the hole and make his bed again His room will stink but he wont know where its coming from
Lady Sansa
My sister used to do that when she was angry with me And she was always angry with me
Why sheep shift
Thats the vulgar word for dung
My lady
Well you asked me
Oh Thats him
My lord my lady Your father has called a meeting of the small council TYWIN CERSEI VARYS and PYCELLE are already seated JOFFREY walks behind his grandfather excited and grinning
Killed a few puppies today
Show him Come on show him
Oh apologies my lord Old fingers
Roslin caught a fine fat trout Her brothers gave her a pair of wolf pelts for her wedding Signed Walder Frey Is that bad poetry or is it supposed to mean something
Robb Stark is dead And his bitch mother Write back to Lord Frey Thank him for his service and command him to send Robb Starks head Im going to serve it to Sansa at my wedding feast
Your Grace Lady Sansa is your aunt by marriage
A joke Joffrey did not mean it
Yes I did Im going to have it served to Sansa at my wedding feast
No She is no longer yours to torment
Everyone is mine to torment Youd do well to remember that you little monster
Oh Im a monster Perhaps you should speak to me more softly then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
I could have your tongue out for saying that
Let him make his threats Hmm Hes a bitter little man
Lord Tyrion should apologize immediately Unacceptable disrespectful and in very bad taste
I am the king I will punish you
Any man who must say I am the king is no true king Ill make sure you understand that when Ive won your war for you
My father won the real war He killed Prince Rhaegar He took the crown while you hid under Casterly Rock
The king is tired See him to his chambers
Come along
Im not tired
We have so much to celebrate A wedding to plan You must rest
Grand Maester perhaps some essence of nightshade to help him sleep
Im not tired
Come
Not you
You just sent the most powerful man in Westeros to bed without his supper
Youre a fool if you believe hes the most powerful man in Westeros
A treasonous statement Joffrey is king
You really think a crown gives you power
No I think armies give you power
Mmhmm
Robb Stark had one never lost a battle and you defeated him all the same
Mmhmm
Oh I know Walder Frey gets all the credit Or the blame I suppose depending on your allegiance Walder Frey is many things but a brave man No He never would have risked such an action if he didnt have certain assurances
Which he got from me Do you disapprove
Im all for cheating This is war
But to slaughter them at a wedding Explain to me why it is more noble to kill 10000 men in battle than a dozen at dinner
So thats why you did it To save lives
To end the war To protect the family Do you want to write a song for the dead Starks Go ahead write one Im in this world a little while longer to defend the Lannisters to defend my blood
The northerners will never forget
Good Let them remember what happens when they march on the south All the Stark men are dead Winterfell is a ruin Roose Bolton will be named Warden of the North until your son by Sansa comes of age
I believe you still have some work to do on that score
Do you think shell open her legs for me after I tell her how we murdered her mother and brother
One way or another you will get that girl pregnant
I will not rape her
Shall I explain to you in one easy lesson how the world works
Use small words Im not as bright as you
The house that puts family first will always defeat the house that puts the whims and wishes of its sons and daughters first A good man does everything in his power to better his familys position regardless of his own selfish desires
Does that amuse you
No its a very good lesson Only its easy for you to preach utter devotion to family when youre making all the decisions
Easy for me is it
When have you ever done something that wasnt in your interest but solely for the benefit of the family
The day that you were born I wanted to carry you into the sea and let the waves wash you away Instead I let you live And I brought you as my son Because youre a Lannister
Sansa
Its empty
Lets find a place to sleep
Hodor Hodor
Dont Hodor
Maybe we shouldnt stay
Youd rather be out there
There are a lot of stories about this place Horrible stories
I always quite liked the horrible stories
So did I Once
You ever heard about the Rat Cook
No Whos he
Just a cook in the Nights Watch He was angry at the king for something I dont remember When the king was visiting the Nightfort the cook killed the kings son cooked him into a big pie with onions carrots mushrooms and bacon That night he served the pie to the king He liked the taste of his son so much he asked for a second slice The gods turned the cook into a giant white rat who could only eat his own young Hes been roaming the Nightfort ever since devouring his own babies But no matter what he does hes always hungry
If the gods turned every killer into a giant white rat
It wasnt for murder the gods cursed the Rat Cook or for serving the kings son in a pie He killed a guest beneath his roof Thats something the gods cant forgive
The late Walder Frey old Hoster called me because I didnt get my men to the Trident in time for battle He thought he was witty Look at us now Tully Youre dead your daughterCatelyns dead your grandsons dead your son spent his wedding night in a dungeon and Im Lord of Riverrun
The Blackfish escaped
An old man on the run with no allies I have Tywin Lannister backing me Who does he have
As you say
They all laughed at me all those high lords They all thought they were better than me Ned Stark Hoster Tully People snigger when I marry a young girl but who said a word when Jon Arryn married the little Tully bitch
Youll be needing a new young girl
Yeah Got that to look forward to
And you the Warden of the North No more Starks to bow and scrape to Must have been torture following that stupid boy all over the country
He ignored my advice at every turn If hed been a trifle less arrogant
Calling himself the Young Wolf Hows that for pomposity
Well heres to the Young Wolf
Forever young
Will you move to Winterfell now that the wars over
At some point perhaps But Winterfells in ruins
Yeah What happened up there I heard the Greyjoy boy seized the place I heard he killed all the ravens And after that nothing
I sent my bastard Ramsay to root him out Robb Stark offered amnesty for the ironborn if they gave us Theon
Oh And
Ramsay delivered the terms The ironborn turned on Theon as we knew they would They handed him over trussed and hooded But Ramsay well Ramsay has his own way of doing things
Well the girls werent lying You had a goodsized cock
What No Pork sausage You think Im some sort of savage
People talk about phantom limbs An amputee might have an itch where his foot used to be So Ive always wondered do eunuchs have a phantom cock
Next time you think about naked girls would you feel an itch
Sorry I shouldnt make jokes My mother taught me not to throw stones at cripples
But my father taught me to aim for their head
Kill me
Sorry what
Kill me
A little louder
Kill me
Youre no good to me dead We need you
You dont look like a Theon Greyjoy anymore Thats a name for a lord But youre not a lord are you Youre just meat
Stinking meat
You reek Reek Thats a good name for you Whats your name
Theon Greyjoy
Whats your name
Th Theon Greyjoy
Please
What is your name
Reek My name is Reek
Hodor
Dont kill me
Who are you
Sam Sam
Who are you
Gilly Dont hurt us
Where are you going
To Castle Black Im a brother of the Nights Watch
My brother hes in the Nights
Shush
Whos your brother
Doesnt matter
Youre Jons brother The one who fell from the window
No Im not
Ive been around Ghost enough to know a direwolf when I see one And Ive heard all about Hodor
Hodor
Id be dead if it wasnt for Jon If youre his brother youre my brother too And anything I can do to help you I will
Take us north of the Wall
What Why in the world would you want to go
I dont want to I have to
How did you get through the Wall
Does the well lead to an underground river Is that how you came here
Come with us There are steps carved into the south side of the Wall Hodor can carry you to the top Well walk straight to Castle Black
Come with us Theres nothing north but death
If Jon is alive then Castle Blacks where hell be Its the safest place for you
Theres nowhere safe any longer You know that
What I know is what I saw And if you saw it too youd run the other way
You saw the white walkers and the army of the dead
How do you know all that
The Nights Watch cant stop them The kings of Westeros and all their armies cant stop them
But youre going to stop them
Please Sam I have to go north I have to
Balon Greyjoy Lord of the Iron Islands and invader of the North I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shitstained rocks you call a home
On the first night of the full moon I will hunt down every islander still in our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell In the box youll find a special gift Theons favorite toy He cried when I took it away from him
Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon Signed Ramsay Snow naturalborn son of Roose Bolton Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North Get that out of my sight
Theon disobeyed my orders
The boy is a fool He cannot further the Greyjoy line I will not give up the lands I have seized the strongholds I have taken Get this away from me
Hes your son
Son Hes not a man anymore
Hes your son Hes my brother Hes a Greyjoy
Watch yourself Ive made my decision
And Ive made mine Im going to pick the fastest ship in our fleet
Im going to choose the 50 best killers on the Iron Islands
Get those ropes
Im going to sail up the Narrow Sea all the way to the Weeping Water Im going to march on the Dreadfort Im going to find my little brother and Im going to bring him home
What is it
Dragonglass
We found them at the Fist Someone buried them a long time ago Someone wanted us to find them
Why What are they for
Killing white walkers
How do you know that
The walker came for my Baby And Sam
But no ones killed a white walker in thousands of years
Well I suppose someone had to be the first
Take it Hodor
And the archer I got lucky with one of them There are more Many more And for every one of them the dead men more than you could count I wish youd come with us
I wish I could I really do
How are you keeping
Great Never better
It was just a bit of blood
I should have known Every time a highborn asks my name its trouble Were not really people to you are we Just a million different ways to get what you want
Im not a highborn
She called you Ser I heard it
A recent state of affairs I was born in Flea Bottom just like you
Sure you were Youre my friend Youre here to help
I lived below the Street of Flour
How far below How close to the Red Keep were you
The shit that poured from their privy pipes flowed down the side of Aegons Hill along Tanners Row and right in front of my front door on Gin Alley
Gin Alley
The Street of Steel with your armor and your knights Pfft You lived in the fancy part of town And here we are now Two boys from Flea Bottom in the castle of a king
Yeah weve come a long way Were all the same really She went to great pains to point that out to me
If you mistrust fancy people so much why were you in such a hurry to trust her
Youre me Never been with a woman Never talked to a woman really And then she comes at you big words no clothes What would you have done
She does know her way around a mans head Ill give her that
So howd you become a lord
Oh thats a long story
Better not then Im a bit busy
Many years ago I helped King Stannis out of a difficult situation He rewarded me with a lordship And this
You see Highborns
I didnt want to be a lord I nearly didnt accept
Why did you
I did it for my son I didnt want him to step over a river of shit every time he stepped through his front door I wanted him to have a better life
Does he
Hes dead
Howd he die
Following me
When did you come to this strange country
When I was 13
You were only a child
I stopped being a child when I was nine My mother made sure of that
Youve been a good influence on our mutual friend you know He used to drink from sundown to sunup visit three brothels a night gamble away his fathers money Now its just the drinking
And now Im his wifes servant I brush her hair and clip her nails and empty her chamber pot
She is a sweet young thing None of this is her fault
I love that girl I would kill for her Do you think that makes it easier for me
No I expect not
Shes young and shes beautiful and highborn
We break bread with them but that doesnt make us family Weve learned their language but well never be their countrymen If you let yourself believe that a foreign girl with no name could spend her life with the son of Tywin Lannister
I have a name
You have one name As do I Here only the family name matters
What do you want from me Lord Varys
Diamonds Id tell you to beware carrying so much wealth but you know how to protect yourself Get on one of those ships Sail to Pentos or Lys or Myr You can buy a house with these diamonds a very large house Hire servants Start a new life a good life far from here The mysterious foreign beauty Youll have suitors lining up
Why do you want me to leave
Tyrion Lannister is one of the few people alive who could make this country a better place He has the mind for it he has the will he has the right last name And you you are a complication I know you love him And I know its true love not bought by gold and silver Im not asking you to leave him for money Im asking you to leave because your presence in the capital endangers him This will never be your home my lady Find a true home somewhere far from here while theres still time
Lord Varys
If he wants me to leave he can tell me himself
Keep up
I dont think I can my lord
Its not easy being drunk all the time Everyone would do it if it were easy
Leave
So enjoying married life An unhappy wife is a wine merchants best friend
She doesnt deserve this
Deserve Be careful with that Start trying to work out who deserves what and before long youll spend the rest of your days weeping for each and every person in the world
Theres nothing worse than a lateblooming philosopher
Will you be facing your marriage to Ser Loras with the same philosophical spirit
I wont be marrying Ser Loras
I seem to remember saying something similar about my own marriage
Youre not me You want to make things better for Sansa Give her a child
So you can tell Father it was you who finally talked me into it
So she can have some happiness in her life
You have children How happy would you say you are
Not very But if it werent for my children Id have thrown myself from the highest window in the Red Keep Theyre the reason Im alive
Even Joffrey
Even Joffrey He was all I had once Before Myrcella was born I used to spend hours looking at him His wisps of hair His tiny little hands and feet He was such a jolly little fellow You always hear the terrible ones were terrible babies We should have known Even then we should have known Its nonsense Whenever he was with me he was happy And no one can take that away from me not even Joffrey how it feels to have someone Someone of your own
How long does it go on
Until weve dealt with all our enemies
Every time we deal with an enemy we create two more
Then I suppose it will go on for quite a long time
Im telling you thats what she did Sounded like a cow in heat
Aye not for long
Thats right Black Walder shut her up right quick None of the Starks had much to say about the end of that meal
Ill tell you what though The hardest thing was getting that wolfs head to stay on the body
You sewed it on
I did
I bet there were 1000 men claiming they were the one
It was me And Malcolm and Talbott Well the thing was so heavy it fell off the first time Took the skin right with it What we ended up having to do was hook the needle right under the collarbone Give it a nice firm mooring and
What do you want
Mind if I keep warm
Fuck off
But Im hungry
Does fuck off mean something different where youre from
Ive got money
What kind of coin is that
Its worth a lot
Sorry
Little shit
Fool
Where did you get the knife
From you
Is that the first man youve killed
The first man
Next time youre going to do something like that tell me first
Valar morghulis
Ygritte you know I didnt have a choice You always knew who I was what I am
I have to go home now I know you wont hurt me
You know nothing Jon Snow
I do know some things I know I love you
I know you love me But I have to go home now and spurs his horse YGRITTE has found her resolve She notches another arrow She tracks him and shoots him a third time as he gallops away She begins to weep
I know how this must look What I meant was
I swear to you my lord
Im not a lord my dear Not for many many years Every man who joins the Nights Watch renounces all former titles Among other things What is your name
Gilly
Ah for the gillyflower Lovely
Yes my
Maester
Master
Maester
And the child
She hasnt chosen a name yet
His name is Sam
Tarly do you remember the oath you swore when you joined this order
Hes not my child Maester Aemon Shes one of Crasters wives I remember every word of the oath Night gathers and my watch begins I am the shield that guards the realms of men The realms of men That means her as well as us We didnt build 500 miles of ice walls 700 feet high to keep men out The night is gathering Maester Aemon Ive seen it Its coming for all of us
Gilly you and your son will be our guests for the time being We certainly cannot send you back beyond the Wall
Thank you Maester I can cook and clean and I can
Good Samwell fetch a quill and inkwell I hope your penmanship is better than your swordplay
Miles better
We had 44 ravens at last count Make sure theyre all fed Every one of them flies tonight
To His Grace King Stannis Baratheon Invaded inv invit invited to the name day celebration for Rylene Florent on the first nigit
First night of the full moon Why is there a G in night
I dont know There just is
Well your fathers not going to go to that
My books are better than these boring scrolls You could read about Balerion the Dread They say you can still see his skull in the dungeons beneath the Red Keep Id like to see that someday
Ive been trying to stay out of those dungeons my whole life
His fangs were as long as bastard swords
Aye old Balerions definitely better than anything your cousin Rylenes got on offer But now that Im your fathers Hand again I have to keep him informed The king does not have time for this drudgery To all the lords and knobble men of Westeros
Noblemen
Noblemen of Westeros the Nig the Nights Watch implores
What is it
Why are they ringing the bells Are we being attacked
Stay here Bar the door
The usurper Robb Stark is dead Betrayed by his bannerman
And you take credit because you dropped a leech into the fire
I take no credit I have faith and my faith has been rewarded
Your Grace the world has got so far bent Ive seen things crawl out of nightmares but my eyes were open I dont know if Robb Stark died because of the Red Womans sorcery or because at war men die all the time but I do know that uniting the Seven Kingdoms with blood magic is wrong It is evil And you are not an evil man
Do you know who had this table carved and painted Ser Davos
Aegon Targaryen
And do you know how Aegon Targaryen conquered Westeros
On the back of his dragon Balerion the Dread
He had a smaller fleet than the kings he faced and a smaller army but he had three dragons Dragons are magic Ser Davos My enemies have made my kingdom bleed I will not forget that I will not forgive that I will punish them with any arms at my disposal
You do not need to burn the boy If what you say is true a drop of his blood killed Robb Stark
And our king is still no closer to the Iron Throne A great gift requires a great sacrifice
His name is Gendry Hes a good lad A poor lad from Flea Bottom who happens to be your nephew
What is the life of one bastard boy against a kingdom
Everything
The boy must die
What are you doing
Youre leaving
Is this some kind of trick
Yes but not on you
Aim for that star Dont stop Theres bread and water Go slow with it If you finish it off no matter how thirsty you get dont drink seawater
I know not to drink seawater
Row for a full day and night and youll reach Rooks Rest Youll want to stop there Dont Shell find you
Where should I go
You must keep the coast on your left side until you reach Kings Landing
The gold cloaks are looking for me
They were looking for me for 20 years Do they know your face
No
Id worry more about the Red Woman
The other way
You ever been in a boat before
No
You know how to swim
No
Dont fall out Go on
Why are you doing this
Because its right And because Im a slow learner
When you get to Flea Bottom have a bowl of brown for me
Horse approaching Halt Halt
Jon Jon Jon its us
I dont think he can see us
Pyp Sam
Hush now Youre home Carry him inside Gently
Out of the way Step aside country boy People working here
Cersei
You dont deny it
No I let him go
Your mercy saved the boys life You feel good about that
Aye I do
You saved one innocent How many tens of thousands have you doomed
There has got to be another way
What other way Tell us about this other way
I dont know Your Grace I cant see the future in the fire
Very well Ser Davos Seaworth I Stannis of the House Baratheon First of My Name Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men sentence you to die
I understand But since you havent yet unnamed me Hand of the King it is my duty to advise you against it Youre gonna need me
Take him away
Why am I gonna need you
My king
Its from Maester Aemon of the Nights Watch Their Lord Commander is dead Took a ranging party north and never made it back One lad did though What he saw beyond the Wall its coming for all of us
When did you learn to read
Matthos taught me before he died so I could be of better service to you
This War of Five Kings means nothing The true war lies to the north my king Death marches on the Wall Only you can stop him
You cant stop him alone You need someone to rebuild your army for you someone to convince this lord and that lord to fight for you to bring sellswords and pirates to your side
Ive made my decision
Hes right You need him He has a part to play in the war to come
You see Ser Davos Youve been saved by that fire god you like to mock Youre in his army now
They will come Your Grace When theyre ready
Perhaps they didnt want to be conquered
You didnt conquer them You liberated them
People learn to love their chains
This is Daenerys Targaryen the Stormborn the Unburnt the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros Mother of Dragons It is to her you owe your freedom
No
You do not owe me your freedom I cannot give it to you Your freedom is not mine to give It belongs to you and you alone If you want it back you must take it for yourselves Each and every one of you
Mhysa
Mhysa
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
What does it mean
It is old Ghiscari khaleesi It means mother
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
Its all right These people wont hurt me
Fly
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
Let me pass
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
Magnificent
Mmhmm
Looks freshforged
It is
No ones made a Valyrian steel sword since the Doom of Valyria
There are three living smiths who know how to rework Valyrian steel The finest of them was in Volantis Came here to Kings Landing at my invitation
Where did you get this much Valyrian steel
From someone who no longer had need of it
Youve wanted one of these in the family for a long time
And now we have two
Two
The original weapon was absurdly large Plenty of steel for two swords
Well thank you Its glorious
Youll have to train your left hand
Any decent swordsman knows how to use both hands
Youll never be as good
No But as long as Im better than everyone else I suppose it doesnt matter
You cant serve in the Kingsguard with one hand
Wheres that written I can and I will ingsguard oath is for life
The war is over The king is safe The king is never safe
How many people in this city alone would love to see his head on a pike
Other knights protected the king while you were a prisoner They will continue to do so when you go home
Home
Youll return to Casterly Rock and rule in my stead
You are the Lord of Casterly Rock
I am the Kings Hand My place is here I dont expect to see the Rock again before I die
You know what they call me Kingslayer Oathbreaker Man without honor Now you want me to break another sacred vow
You wont be breaking anything There is a precedent to relieve a Kingsguard of his duties The king will exercise that prerogative
No
No
No
I dont believe I asked you a question
Theres my answer
If you think your bloody honor comes before
My bloody honor is beyond repair but my answer is still no I dont want Casterly Rock I dont want a wife I dont want children
What do you want
Supper would be nice
For 40 years Ive tried to teach you If you havent learned by now you never will Go If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition go serve
I suppose you want the sword back
Keep it
A onehanded man with no family needs all the help he can get
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat
Please dont
Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern That way one party is late the other party can drink some ale inside
This is the Prince of Dorne were waiting for not one of your sellsword friends
If hes so damned important how come they sent you to meet him
Theres bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock Has been for years
And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood it may as well be yours eh
No need for cynicism I happen to be an accomplished diplomat
Oh
Ah here we are
Can you read the sigils
Yellow balls
Wild lemons on a purple field House Dalt of Lemonwood A vulture grasping a baby in its talons House Blackmont A crowned skull the Manwoodys of Kingsgrave
Boy knows his Dornish Houses
I need a sigil
And House Martell a red sun pierced by a spear
I dont see it my lord
Well met my lords His Grace King Joffrey welcomes you in his name My lord father the Kings Hand sends his greetings as well I am Tyrion Lannister of Casterly Rock Master of Coin Forgive me I dont see Prince Doran in your company
The princes health forces him to remain at Sunspear He sends his brother Prince Oberyn to attend the royal wedding in his stead
Yes the king will be delighted to enjoy the company of a warrior as renowned as Prince Oberyn at his wedding feast
Will he
And where is Prince Oberyn
Arrived before dawn Not a man for welcome parties our prince
Very well My lords these fine men from the City Watch will escort you to your quarters in the Red Keep
You must be weary after such a long journey
Some accomplished diplomacy that was Now where
We must find Prince Oberyn before he kills somebody or several somebodies
How do you plan on finding a single Dornishman in a city this big
Youre famous for fucking half of Westeros You just arrived at the capital after two weeks of bad roads where would you go
Id probably go to sleep but Im getting old
Look at this one How lovely is she
Beautiful But pale
They like them pale in the capital Shows they dont work the fields Do I frighten you
You like
Timid Timid bores me
Youre a bit of mischief arent you
I think she likes you ELLARIA She has good taste
Youre not timid are you
Not timid
Do you like women
When they look like her my lord
This one will do nicely
Very good my lady
Oh Im not a lady
A term of courtesy in this establishment
A lie anywhere Why not use the right words Im a bastard She is a whore And youre what A procurer
Any of the others
The two girls can leave
You stay
Im afraid Im not an offer my lord
Everyone who works for Littlefinger is an offer Take off your clothes Well be here a while
My lord
I am a prince boy Have you ever been with a prince
Cant say I have Im wildly expensive
Take off your clothes
Which way do you like it
My way
And so he spoke and so he spoke That Lord of Castamere And now the rains
Oberyn
Weep oer his hall
Oberyn dont
With no one there to hear Yes not the rains weep oer his hall And not a soul to hear
You lost friend
Forgive me for staring I dont see many Lannisters where Im from
I dont see many Dornishmen in the capital
We dont like the smell
Come with me lover
Gods look at this one
Sirs if you follow me Ill arrange for a private room
Why are you wasting a woman like this on a Dornishman Bring him a shaved goat and a bottle of olive oil
Do you know why all the world hates a Lannister
You think your gold and your lions and your gold lions make you better than everyone May I tell you a secret Youre not a golden lion Youre just a pink little man who is far too slow on the draw
Longsword is a bad option in close quarters When I pull my blade your friend starts bleeding Quite a lot Im afraid So many veins in the wrist
Hell live if you get him help straightaway So decisions
Prince Oberyn forgive the intrusion We heard there might be
trouble
Apologies my love
Im here to welcome you to the capital
Ellaria Sand my paramour The kings own Uncle Imp Tyrion son of Tywin Lannister
If theres anything I can do to make your stay
What are you His hired killer
It started that way aye Now Im a knight
How did that come to pass
Killed the right people I suppose
Well need a few more girls Girls yes OBERYN You dont partake
Oh I partook Now Im married
Prince Oberyn if I may a word in private
Seems I visited the Lannister brothel by mistake
Oh they take all kinds
Even Dornishmen
The king is very grateful that you traveled all this way for his wedding
Let us speak truth here Joffrey is insulted I am only the second son after all
Well speaking as a fellow second son I have grown rather used to being the family insult
Why did you come to Kings Landing Prince Oberyn
I was invited to the royal wedding
I thought we were speaking truth
The last time I was in the capital was many years ago Another wedding My sister Elia and Rhaegar Targaryen the Last Dragon My sister loved him She bore his children Swaddled them rocked them fed them at her own breast Elia wouldnt let the wet nurse touch them And beautiful noble Rhaegar Targaryen left her for another woman That started a war and the war ended right here when your fathers army took the city
I wasnt actually present
And butchered those children My nephew and niece Carved them up and wrapped them in Lannister cloaks And my sister you know what they did to her
Im asking you a question
Ive heard rumors
So have I The one I keep hearing is that Gregor Clegane the Mountain raped Elia and split her in half with his great sword
I wasnt there I dont know what happened
If the Mountain killed my sister your father gave the order Tell your father Im here And tell him the Lannisters arent the only ones who pay their debts
Theyre dragons Khaleesi They can never be tamed Not even by their mother
Ser Barristan
Your Grace
Wheres Daario Naharis Wheres Grey Worm
Gambling Your Grace
Gambling
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
How long have they been at it
Since midnight Your Grace
Ser Worm is stronger than he looks But I can see his arms beginning to shake
Whats the prize to winning this stupid contest
The honor of riding by your side on the road to Meereen
That honor goes to Ser Jorah and Ser Barristan as neither of them kept me waiting this morning You two will ride in the rear guard and protect the livestock
The last man holding his sword can find a new queen to fight for
You like this girl Must be frustrating
You are not a smart man Daario Naharis
Id rather have no brains and two balls
You need to eat something
Pigeon pie
No thank you
Lemon cakes
No thank you
You love lemon cakes
Tell her she needs to eat
My lady you do need to eat
I dont need to eat
If I could have a moment alone with my wife
She needs to eat
I cant let you starve
I swore to protect you
My lady I am your husband Let me help you
How can you help me
I dont know but I can try
I lie awake all night staring at the canopy thinking about how they died
I could get you essence of nightshade to help you sleep
Do you know what they did to my brother How they sewed his direwolfs head onto his body And my mother They say they cut her throat to the bone and threw her body in the river
What happened to your family was a terrible crime I didnt know your brother He seemed like a good man but I didnt know him Your mother on the other hand I admired her She wanted to have me executed but I admired her She was a strong woman And she was fierce when it came to protecting her children Sansa Your mother would want you to carry on You know its true
Will you pardon me my lord Id like to visit the godswood
Of course Of course Prayer can be helpful I hear
I dont pray anymore Its the only place I can go where people dont talk to me
My lion
What are you doing
What does it look like Im doing Come here
How many times have I told you You cant visit me here
I know I know We have come to a dangerous place Have you forgotten me Do you know how long its been
Of course I havent forgotten
I want you Dont you want me
Things are a bit tense right now
What things
My nephew the king wants to murder me My wife hates me because my father murdered her family Oberyn Martell wants to murder everyone whose last name is Lannister
You need to relax
Dont you want to relax
Whats wrong
I told you Its not a good time
Its never a good time You have your child bride now
Shae
Do you love her
Love her I barely know her Shes a child She despises me
Thats not an answer
Of course I dont love her
You tried to ship me away
Ship you away
Give me diamonds and make me disappear
What in the world are you talking about
If you want me to leave just say it Say it
Shh I dont know what youre talking about
You want me to stay
A work of art really The craftsmanship is excellent
You like it so much youre welcome to chop off your own hand and take it
Such an ingrate I spent days with the goldsmith getting the details just right
Days
Better part of an afternoon There how does that feel
Uh a hook would be more practical
Elegant I think
Thank you for your help with the other matter
The symptoms have abated
Gone completely I am in your debt Maester Qyburn
Not a maester Your Grace but happy to help whenever I can
Odd little man
Ive grown rather fond of him Hes quite talented you know
What symptoms
Symptoms that are not your concern
You let him touch you
You jealous
Im surprised You never let Pycelle near you
You think Id let that old lecher put his hands on me He smells like a dead cat
Im not sure Ive ever smelled a dead cat
Well they smell like Pycelle
You drink more than you used to
Yes
Why
Lets see you started a brawl in the streets with Ned Stark and disappeared from the capital My husband died in a tragic hunting accident
It must have been traumatic for you
My only daughter was shipped off to Dorne We suffered through a siege
A rather short siege
A rather short siege that I didnt expect to survive And now Im marrying my eldest son to a wicked little bitch from Highgarden while Im supposed to marry her brother a renowned pillow biter So
Father disowned me today
He cant disown you Youre all hes got
Youre forgetting Tyrion
You dont really plan on staying in the Kingsguard do you
Staying in the Kingsguard means I live right here in the Red Keep with you
Not now
I want Not now When Ive been back for weeks
Somethings changed
Everythings changed You come back after all this time with no apologies and one hand and expect everything to be the same
What do you want me to apologize for
For leaving me
You think I wanted to be taken prisoner
Dont know what you wanted You werent here You left me alone
Every day I was a prisoner I plotted my escape Every day I murdered people so I could be here with you
You took too long
I What are you saying
Im saying you took too long
Come in
Go away
Forgive me Your Grace You told me to come at once if there was anything important
You plan on killing all the crows yourself
Do you plan on sitting here scratching your balls till winter
We wait for Mances orders
You sent a man over the Wall at the full moon If hes not back yet hes not coming back
And what is it you want March on Castle Black with just this lot Your pretty crow said 1000 men are nesting there
Yeah well hes a liar
He is Shouldnt it be he was  You said you put three arrows in him
I did
Ive seen you slip a shaft through a rabbits eye at 200 yards If that boys still walking its cause you let him go
Thenns I fucking hate Thenns
Mance sent you
How did you find us
You came from the south not the north
Took a detour Got some supper from a village down that way
Why does the meat down here taste so much better than it does on our side of the Wall
Help yourself
Maybe everythings just better fed down here
Fat and lazy Easier for us hmm
You didnt see us coming Lost your warg And that baby crow you had with you lost him too
Ill answer to Mance I wont answer to you
She yours
Im not anybodys
Too scrawny Not like those crows at Castle Black
Think of them stuck in their larders stuffing their faces with ham and blood sausage and stew getting nice and fat and marbled
I know weve had our differences Tormund but just one time before you die you really ought to try crow
Draw Loose
Last time I saw him he was in the courtyard at Winterfell He said Next time I see you youll be all in black I was jealous of Robb my whole life The way my father looked at him I wanted that He was better than me at everything fighting and hunting and riding and girls Gods the girls loved him I wanted to hate him but I never could
Sometimes I want to hate you
Well youre better than me at everything Except reading
Theyre theyre ready for you
Hes wanted to hang me for a while Nows his chance
No ones going to hang you Youve done nothing wrong
Ive done plenty wrong
So you admit you murdered Qhorin Halfhand
I didnt murder him
No You put your sword through a brother of the Nights Watch What do you call that
He wanted me to kill him
A bastard son of a traitor What would you expect
The Halfhand believed our only chance to stop Mance was to get a man inside his army
Dont talk about the Halfhand as if you knew him He was my brother
Then youd know hed do anything to defend the Wall The free folk would have boiled him alive but letting me kill him
The free folk Listen to him He even talks like a wildling now
Aye I talk like a wildling I ate with the wildlings I climbed the Wall with the wildlings I I laid with a wildling girl
You admit to breaking your vows then
I do
The law is the law The boy must die
If we beheaded every ranger who lay with a girl the Wall would be manned by headless men
Theres a difference between sneaking off to the Moles Town brothel and sleeping with the enemy
While we sit here debating which rules I broke Mance Rayder marches on the Wall with an army of 100000
Impossible You cant get 50 wildlings together before they start killing each other
100000 Hes united the Thenns the Hornfoots the iceriver clans He has giants fighting for him
Giants
Have you ever been beyond the Wall ser
I commanded the City Watch of Kings Landing boy
And now youre here You must not have been very good at your job
How dare you
Theres a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane I killed their warg and three others They shot me full of arrows Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north The signal for the attack will be a bonfire Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen Thats the truth All the truth
Do you intend to execute me or am I free to go
None of us are free We are men of the Nights Watch But we wont be taking your head today Jon Snow Go on
I am acting commander here Maester Aemon
Yes you are
And I dont trust the bastard
He told the truth
And you always know when a mans telling a lie How did you acquire this magical power
I grew up in Kings Landing
No No Youre a queen not an ox
Your grandfather gave me a necklace just like this one for my 51st nameday
The wedding is in a fortnight Grandmother You cant say no to everything
Nonsense
My little dears Go and speak to the jewelers of Kings Landing Tell them who you are tell them who sent you The one who brings me the best necklace will get to keep the next best
The Margaery Tyrell who walks into the sept a fortnight from now will inspire 1000 songs Now how sad it will be if shes wearing rubbish like that
Perhaps I should just let Joffrey choose it for me End up with a string of dead sparrow heads around my neck
You watch that Even here even with me
My word
My lady My lady Please pardon me for interrupting My name is Brienne of Tarth
We know who you are Weve heard all about you But hearing is one thing Arent you just marvelous Absolutely singular
I hear you knocked my grandson into the dirt like the silly little boy he is
My lady I know this is a very busy time for you but if I could just have a moment
You dare not refuse
A shadow
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon I swear to you by all the gods it was Stannis He plunged his sword through Renlys heart and disappeared One day my lady I will avenge our king
Joffrey is our king now
I meant no offense
And youve given none
All the Kingsguard will be on duty of course Ser Boros will be stationed here Ser Preston will be stationed here beside the primary entertainment Your Grace
Yes yes one guard at the the thing Go on
Ser Meryn will guard Lady Margaery and Tommen
Ive always guarded the king himself my lord Ever since your absence
And I thank you for it All very good I dont expect any trouble
The people love their king They know who keeps them fed
Margaery Tyrell Ive heard
By my leave They know I saved the city They know I won the war
The wars not won Not while Stannis lives
I broke Stannis on the Blackwater Pity you werent there to help Uncle
My apologies Your Grace I was rather busy
Busy getting captured
So this is the famous Book of Brothers  All the great deeds of all the great Kingsguard Ser Arthur Dayne The Sword of the Morning Led the attack on the Kingswood Brotherhood Defeated the Smiling Knight in single combat Ser Duncan the Tall Four pages for Ser Duncan He must have been quite a man
So they say
Ser Jaime Lannister
Someone forgot to write down all your great deeds
Theres still time
Is there For a 40yearold knight with one hand How can you protect me with that
I use my left hand now Your Grace Makes for more of a contest
Have you ever been to Meereen
Several times Your Grace with Master Kraznys
And
They say 1000 slaves died building the Great Pyramid of Meereen
And now an army of former slaves is marching to her gates You think the Great Masters are worried
If theyre smart Your Grace
You were told to ride at the back of the train
Yes my queen But I need to speak to you about something important A matter of strategy
Your Grace
All right what is this matter of strategy
A dusk rose
Would you like to walk at the back of the train instead of riding
And this ones called ladys lace
Would you like to walk without shoes
You have to know a land to rule it Its plants its rivers its roads its people Dusk rose tea eases fever Everyone in Meereen knows that Especially the slaves who have to make the tea If you want them to follow you you have to become a part of their world Strategy
Harpys Gold No tea from this one Beautiful but poisonous
You are a gambler arent you
Your Grace
Theres one on every mile marker between here and Meereen
How many miles are there between here and Meereen
163 Your Grace Ill tell our men to ride ahead and bury them You dont need to see this
You will do no such thing I will see each and every one of their faces Remove her collar before you bury her
There she is
Yes there she is
And You made a promise
To return the Stark girls to their mother who is now dead
To keep them safe
Well Arya Stark hasnt been seen since her father was killed Where do you think she is My moneys on dead Theres a certain safety in death wouldnt you say And Sansa Stark is now Sansa Lannister Bit of a complication
A complication does not release you from a vow
What do you want me to do Kidnap my sisterinlaw And take her where Where would she be safer than here
Look me in the eye and tell me that you think shell be safe in Kings Landing
Are you sure were not related Ever since Ive returned every Lannister Ive seen has been a miserable pain in my ass Maybe youre a Lannister too Youve got the hair for it if not the looks
Its all right Its all right Its all right
Youre drunk
Yes I have good reason to be Once I was a knight Now Im only a fool Dont you know me
Ser Dontos The kings nameday celebration Im sorry I should have remembered
I cant accept your apology I may be a fool but Im a living fool thanks to you
Anyone would have done the same
But only you did I can never repay you You gave me my life But this this is worth more than my life
It belonged to my mother and her mother before her House Hollard was strong once House on the rise Thats all thats left of those days thanks to a few sad fat drunks like me
I cant take it Its very very kind of you but I cant
I dont have anything else left Thats all Take it Wear it Let my name have one more moment in the sun before it disappears from the world
Ill wear it with pride Ser Dontos
Yeah
When am I going to get a horse of my own
The little lady wants a pony
The little lady wants away from your stench
Horses arent easy to come by Even if they were you think Im gonna put you on your own horse Watch the only thing of value Ive got in the world ride away
Why dont you have any money Didnt you steal anything from Joffrey before you left
No
Youre not very smart are you
Im not a thief
Youre fine with murdering little boys but thieving is beneath you
A mans got to have a code
You think Im gonna escape Where would I go Id be dead by nightfall without you My familys gone Ive got no one
Youve got an aunt in the Vale Your rich Aunt Lysa After I sell you to her maybe shell have enough left over to buy you that pony you want so much
Im hungry Youre hungry
Five horses five men More than I feel like killing on an empty stomach

So Ive heard Stannis defeated at the Blackwater Robb Stark killed at the Twins And where am I for all of it Stuck with your brother Meaning no offense

Youre a talker Listening to talkers makes me thirsty
Ah And hungry Think Ill take two chickens
You dont seem to understand the situation

You lived your life for the king Youre gonna die for some chickens

We have to reward the hounds love They did all the hard work
Why I did whatever you asked
But you made Myranda feel jealous
Me jealous of her

You can see that your presence has become a bit of a problem
Rip her Rip her Rip her
Not so pretty now
Your new hand its nicer than the old one Wouldnt you agree Pod
Is it solid gold
Gilded steel
Youre not eating Why is no one eating My wife wastes away and my brother starves himself
Im not hungry
You lost a hand not a stomach Try the boar Cersei cant get enough of it since one killed Robert for her
A toast To the proud Lannister children The dwarf the cripple and the mother of madness
Oh
Ill clean it up
No Ill do it Leave us
Its only wine
I cant fight anymore
What about your left
I can hold a sword but all my instincts are wrong How can I protect the king when I can hardly wipe my own ass
Youre the Lord Commander now Command Let others do the fighting When was the last time Father used a sword
Im not Father Im the Kingslayer When people find out I cant slay a pigeon
Train then Learn to fight with your other hand
With whom You Men talk Soon as someone discovers I cant fight hell tell everyone
You need a proper discreet swordsman As it happens I have just the one
My brother tells me you can keep your mouth shut Unusual talent for a sellsword
He tells me you shit gold just like your father
Is this place safe
Theres this knight Leygood got thunderbolts on his shield
Uhhuh
Right here is where I fuck his wife Shes a screamer that one If they dont hear her they wont hear us
Ive never seen Valyrian steel before Shes a beauty The problem is if you fight with an edged blade Ill have to
And if I fight with an edged blade Ill have no one left to pay me
I havent used a sparring sword since I was nine
Ah Bold warrior you are attacking a man when his guards down
Best time to attack a man
Mind yourself JAIME If I still had my right hand
Plan on growing it back
Come on then
Open the gates
Riders coming in Lets get these horses seen to
Father Welcome home
Walda this is Ramsay Snow my bastard
A pleasure Mother
Hello
See that the horses are fed watered and rubbed down And take Lady Walda to her chambers
This way my lady
Where is your prize
With the hounds Ill have a look at him
I hear you took a hand from the Kingslayer
Word travels How he screamed You would have loved it
Father
What did you do to him
I trained him He was a slow learner but he learned
You flayed him
Peeled a few bits Removed a few others
This was Balon Greyjoys son and heir
Weve been flaying our enemies for 1000 years The flayed man is on our banners
My banners not yours Youre not a Bolton Youre a Snow Tywin Lannister has given me the North But he wont lift a finger to help me take it As long as the ironborn hold Moat Cailin our armies are trapped south of the Neck Theon was a valuable hostage not your plaything I wanted to trade him for Moat Cailin
I already asked Lord Greyjoy refused Savages have no
You sent terms to Balon Greyjoy without my consent
You made me acting Lord of the Dreadfort I acted
I had to smuggle myself into my own lands thanks to the Greyjoys I needed Theon I needed him whole
Theon was our enemy But Reek Reek will never betray us
I placed far too much trust in you
Reek how could you let me stand before my father unshaven Its disrespectful
Im sorry my lord
Give him the razor
If Im not a Bolton Father what does it matter
Go on Reek A nice close shave
Reek tell Father where are Bran and Rickon Stark
I dont know my lord
You murdered them and displayed their corpses at Winterfell
Reek did you murder the Stark boys
No my lord Just two farm boys
And crisped them so no one would know
Yes my lord
The Starks have always ruled the North If Bran and Rickon are alive the country will rally to their side now that Robb Stark is gone
Oh thats right Reek Robb Stark is dead Sorry I know he was like a brother to you But my father put a knife through his heart How do you feel about that
You ready for a hunt
Always Find those boys and Ill give you 1000 acres and a holdfast
Your pet rat have any thoughts on which way they went after Winterfell
Jon Snow is at Castle Black
Who the fuck is Jon Snow
Their bastard brother He could be sheltering them He may know where they are
Even if he doesnt hes half Stark himself Could be a threat
You want to prove yourself a Bolton Gather whatever men you can and ride for Moat Cailin Bring this creature of yours Maybe hell be of some use Take the Moat for the family for our family and Ill reconsider your position
Lord Varys Breakfasting with the king
Im afraid foreigners arent welcome at such exclusive affairs
Oh to be foreign
Ahem
Shae has been noticed Sansas maid saw you with her She already told your sister Its only a matter of time before your father hears
So Im guilty of being seen with my own wifes handmaiden My father will ask you if theres anything more and youll tell him some clever lie
No I will not How long do you imagine your father and sister would let me live if they suspected me of lying I have no pet sellsword to protect me No legendary brother to avenge me Only little birds who whisper in my ear
Forgive me if I dont weep for you
No one weeps for spiders or whores I have friends across the sea who could help her
She wont leave Ive told her this is a dangerous place so many times she no longer believes it
Your father has promised to hang the next whore he finds you with Have you ever known your father to make an idle threat
From House Tyrell and the people of the Reach Your Grace it is my honor to present you with this wedding cup
May you and my daughter Margaery drink deep and live long
A handsome goblet my lord Or shall I call you Father
I shall be honored Your Grace
Shes the whore I told you about The darkhaired one
Have her brought to the Tower of the Hand before the wedding
A book
The Lives of Four Kings Grand Maester Kaeths history of the reigns of Daeron the Young Dragon Baelor the Blessed Aegon the Unworthy and Daeron the Good A book every king should read
Now that the war is won we should all find time for wisdom Thank you Uncle
One of only two Valyrian steel swords in the capital Your Grace freshly forged in your honor
Careful Your Grace Nothing cuts like Valyrian steel
So they say
Such a great sword should have a name What shall I call her
Stormbringer
Terminus
Widows Wail
Wolfsbane
Widows Wail I like that Every time I use it itll be like cutting off Ned Starks head all over again
Dont
You want me on the desk Whats wrong my lion
Dont call me that
What should I call you
Im afraid our friendship cant continue
Our friendship
Theres a ship waiting in the harbor bound for Pentos
What Youll have your own cabin of course and across the Narrow Sea a house servants
What is this
Im a married man My wife has suffered a great deal as you well know I dont want her to suffer anymore on my account I need to uphold my vows
She doesnt want you
I need to do right by her
You dont want her
By our children
What are you afraid of
Im not afraid
You are You are afraid of your father and your sister Youre going to run from them all your life I need you to leave
Im not afraid of them Im not going to run
Shae
We will fight them together Its like you said I am yours and you are mine
Youre a whore Sansa is fit to bear my children and you are not I cant be in love with a whore I cant have children with a whore How many men have you been with 500 5000
How many whores have you been with
I have enjoyed my time with all of them and I have enjoyed my time with you most of all But now that time is over
Youll have a comfortable life in Pentos Bronn will escort you to your ship Stanniss army camp in the Stormlands at night
Hear us now Accept these tokens of our faith my lord and lead us from the darkness
Sire I served you well
Lord of Light show us the way
Selyse youre my sister
Yours are the stars that guide us
Tell him Tell him
Lord of Light protect us for the night is dark and full of terrors
Did you see Their souls It was their souls Our lord took them Did you see
Lord Florent was your brother by law STANNIS He was an infidel
He worshipped the gods of his fathers and their fathers before him They were the gods of your fathers too
I ordered him to tear down his idols He disobeyed
How many ships did he bring to your cause How many men
A good deal more than you
Did you see Ser Davos Theyre with our lord now Their sins all burned away Did you see
Im sure theyre more than grateful my queen
Meats off
Our larders are almost empty
Serve fish then Were on an island
You hate fish
I hate a good many things but I suffer them all the same
When Storms End was under siege and I was starving Stannis boiled soup for me from books The binding glue is made from horses One morning he shot two seagulls on the beach Ive never tasted anything as good as grilled seagull Do you remember
Of course I remember
Have you ever known true hunger my lady
Its all I knew when I was a child
Until you found the Lord of Light
Until he found me
I fear for our daughters soul
Every mother should fear for her childs soul
Shes a stubborn little beast
Shes a child
You barely know her You think shes sweet because she smiles when you visit Shes sullen and stubborn and sinful Why else would the Lord of Light have seen fit to mark her face She needs the rod
Shes my daughter You will not strike her
As you command Perhaps the Lady Melisandre could speak with her
Come in
Were you sleeping Princess
Did you watch the ceremony on the beach
I heard it
And it frightened you
Ser Axell was my uncle He was always kind to me
Theyre in a better place now Princess The fire cleansed them of the sins of the world
But they screamed
Women scream when they give birth Afterward they are filled with joy
Afterward they arent ash and bone
You have so many questions dont you So did I when I was a child I was much like you Only I wasnt a princess
And you didnt have this
No But I suffered in other ways sweet girl believe me What do you know of the gods
I read
Lies and fables Septons speak of seven gods There are but two a god of light and love and joy and a god of darkness evil and fear Eternally at war
There are no seven heavens and no seven hells
Theres only one hell Princess The one we live in now
Hodor
Why did you wake me
Youve been gone for hours
I was hungry
Were all hungry
I was just eating
Summer was eating Your body cant live on the food your wolf consumes Spending too much time in Summers skin is dangerous Youre not a direwolf Bran
Must be glorious though To run to leap to hunt To be whole I know thats tempting but if youre trapped in Summer for too long youll forget what it was to be human
Youd forget us Bran Youd forget your mother and father Youd forget your brothers and sisters Youd forget Winterfell Youd forget you And if we lose you we lose everything
Hodor take me to the tree THREE
Look for me beneath the tree
He saw us THREE
North
I know where we have to go
Let it be known that Margaery of House Tyrell and Joffrey of the Houses Lannister and Baratheon are one heart one flesh one soul Cursed be he who would seek to tear them asunder
With this kiss I pledge my love
We have a new queen
Better her than you
Bit much wouldnt you say
It feels proportionate
Proportionate to what
The expected extravagance
People who spend their money on this sort of nonsense tend not to have it for long
You ought to try enjoying something before you die You might find it suits you
Not now Mace Lord Tywin and I are speaking
Anyway I dont know what youre complaining about Im paying my share
Shall we stick golden roses in half the meat pies to commemorate your generosity
No your heartfelt thankyou is its own reward I would imagine Id be hearing it again before long Wars are rather expensive The Iron Bank will have its due How they love to remind everyone Almost as much as you Lannisters with your debts
Im not worried about the Iron Bank
We both know youre smarter than that Come Tywin let us celebrate young love
All taken care of
You saw her board the ship
Aye shes on it
You saw the ship sail away
No one knows shes there but you me and Varys
How do you know
Because if someone follows me without an invitation Im the last person they ever follow
Theres someone following you
Shes gone I know you dont want to believe it but she is Now go drink till it feels like you did the right thing
Hello
Hello
Not you
You look exquisite child The wind has been at you though I havent had the opportunity to tell you how sorry I was to hear about your brother War is war but killing a man at a wedding horrid What sort of monster would do such a thing As if men need more reasons to fear marriage
My lady My lady
Lord Tyrion you see Not as bad as all that Perhaps if your pauper husband were to sell his mule and his last pair of shoes he might be able to afford to bring you to Highgarden for a visit Now that peace has come and all is right with the world it would do you good to see some of it You must excuse me Its time I ate some of this food I paid for
A coat of gold  Or a coat of red  A lion still has claws And mine my lord
Very good Very good Off you go MARGAERY My love why dont we make the announcement
Everyone The queen would like to say a few words
We are so fortunate to enjoy this marvelous food and drink Not all among us are so lucky To thank the gods for bringing the recent war to a just end King Joffrey has decreed that the leftovers from our feast be given to the poorest in his city
Youre an example to us all
Ser Jaime Im very sorry
Ser Loras its quite all right Your sister looks very beautiful
As does yours
So looking forward to your wedding
Yes very much
Our fathers are both rather keen on the prospect
They certainly are
Perhaps they should get married If you were to marry Cersei shed murder you in your sleep If you somehow managed to put a child in her first shed murder him too long before he drew his first breath Luckily for you none of this will happen because youll never marry her
And neither will you
Your Grace My king My queen
Lady Brienne So good of you to come
Im no lady Your Grace
Did you just bow
Apologies Your Grace I never did master the curtsy
Youre the one who put a sword through Renly Baratheon
Thats not true my love Brienne had nothing to do with it
A shame Id knight the man that put an end to that deviants life
I just wanted to congratulate you both and wish you good fortune The country has been at war too long I hope your reign is long and peaceful
Yes yes
Thank you I hope we see more of you
Lady Brienne Youre Lord Selwyn Tarths daughter That makes you a lady whether you want to be or not
As you say Your Grace
I owe you my gratitude You returned my brother safely to Kings Landing
In truth he rescued me Your Grace More than once
Did he Havent heard that story before
Not such a fascinating story Im afraid
Im sure you have many fascinating stories Sworn to Renly Baratheon Sworn to Catelyn Stark And now my brother Must be exciting to flit from one camp to the next serving whichever lord or lady you fancy
I dont serve your brother Your Grace
But you love him
Your Grace
No no come to my chambers and I will examine you personally
Shell do no such thing
Oh Your Grace Yes well this young lady sought my advice
You should see Qyburn Hes quite good
Your Grace
Qyburn Deplorable man Brought shame on the Citadel with his repugnant experiments
More repugnant than your gnarled fingers on that girls thighs
Your Grace I am a man of learning
My little brother had you sent to the Black Cells when you annoyed him What do you think I could do to you if you annoyed me
I never meant to annoy anyone
But you are You annoy me right now Every breath you draw in my presence annoys me So heres what I want you to do I want you to leave my presence Leave this wedding right now Go to the kitchens and instruct them that all the leftovers from the feast will be brought to the kennels
Your Grace Queen Margaery
The queen is telling you the leftovers will feed the dogs or you will
A gold dragon to whoever knocks my fools hat off
Youre in rather a good mood
I suppose I am
I wont ask why
Small pleasures
Your Grace Lord Tywin
Prince Oberyn
I dont believe you have met Ellaria This is the Lord Hand Tywin Lannister and Cersei Lannister the Queen Regent I suppose it is former Queen Regent now Lord Hand and Lady Cersei Ellaria Sand
My lord My lady
Charmed
Cant say Ive ever met a Sand before
We are everywhere in Dorne I have 10000 brothers and sisters
Bastards are born of passion arent they We dont despise them in Dorne
No How tolerant of you
I expect it is a relief Lady Cersei giving up your regal responsibilities Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked
I suppose youll never know Prince Oberyn Its a shame your older brother couldnt attend the wedding
Please give him our regards With any luck the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again
They call it the rich mans disease A wonder you dont have it
Noblemen in my part of the country dont enjoy the same lifestyle as our counterparts in Dorne
People everywhere have their differences In some places the highborn frown upon those of low birth In other places the rape and murder of women and children is considered distasteful What a fortunate thing for you former Queen Regent that your daughter Myrcella has been sent to live in the latter sort of place
Everyone silence Clear the floor Theres been too much amusement here today A royal wedding is not an amusement A royal wedding is history The time has come for all of us to contemplate our history My lords my ladies
I give you King Joffrey Renly Stannis Robb Stark Balon Greyjoy The War of the Five Kings
Im the rightful king
King in the North
Yes
Traitor Youre a traitor
For the Seven Kingdoms
Let the war begin
Renly youre no king
Away degenerate Away Away
Ooh careful
Go on
I want you to be my prince Stannis
Whos got the gold now Stark
I am the rightful king
Challenge me ruffian
Take that
Im drowning Im drowning
I am the King in the North
Not wildfire
Pay each of them 20 gold when this is done
Yes my lord
Well have to find another way to thank the king
Charge
Ready again
I am the King in the North Charge
Charge Yes
Your head
Fine gentlemen
Well fought Well fought Here you are Champions purse Though youre not the champion yet are you A true champion defeats all the challengers Surely there are others out there who still dare to challenge my reign Uncle How about you Im sure they have a spare costume
One taste of combat was enough for me Your Grace I would like to keep what remains of my face I think you should fight him This was but a poor imitation of your own bravery on the field of battle I speak as a firsthand witness Climb down from the high table with your new Valyrian sword and show everyone how a true king wins his throne Be careful though This one is clearly mad with lust It would be a tragedy for the king to lose his virtue hours before his wedding night
A fine vintage Shame that it spilled
It did not spill
My love come back to me Its time for my fathers toast
Well how does he expect me to toast without wine Uncle you can be my cupbearer seeing as youre too cowardly to fight
Your Grace does me a great honor
Its not meant as an honor
Bring me my goblet
What good is an empty cup Fill it
Kneel Kneel before your king
Kneel I said kneel
Look the pie
My queen
Wonderful Wonderful My hero
Can we leave now
Lets find out
Uncle Where are you going Youre my cupbearer remember
I thought I might change out of these wet clothes Your Grace
No no no No youre perfect the way you are Serve me my wine
Well hurry up This pie is dry
Mm good Needs washing down
If it please Your Grace Lady Sansa is very tired
No No youll wait here un
Your Grace
Its nothing
Hes choking
Help the poor boy
Idiots help your king
Move away
Joffrey Joffrey
Help him Someone help him
Joffrey
Come with me now
Joffrey Joffrey
If you want to live we have to leave
Dont touch him
Joffrey Please Joffrey Joffrey what is it Help him He reaches a hand out towards TYRION who at that moment picks up the goblet from before him JOFFREY gaps a final time as blood continues to stream from his nose his face a horrid shade of purple He dies
My son
Hes gone Our king is gone
He did this He poisoned my son your king Take him Take him Take him Take him
You did this You did this As Sansa looks on Ser Dontos Hollard approaches her
We have to leave
Take him Take him
Where is his wife Wheres Sansa
Find her Bar the gates of the city Seize every ship in the harbor
Where is she
No one leaves the capital No one
Get in
Where are we going
Somewhere safe
Up you go my lady Youll be fine Youre stronger than you know
Lord Baelish
Petyr Are you hurt my lady
Good Good Im sure youve had quite a fright Rest easy The worst is past Ser Dontos shouts up from his boat
Lord Baelish I promised Id get her to you safely
Softly my friend Voices carry over water
I should get back before someone thinks to look for me LITTLEFINGER First youll want your pay 10000 was it
10000
Wait
Shh You dont want the queen to hear do you 1000 gold cloaks are searching for you And if they found you how do you think they would punish the girl who murdered the king
I didnt murder anyone
I know I know But you must admit it looks suspicious The king who executed your father who tormented you for years and you fled the scene of his murder
Why did you kill him
Because he was a drunk and a fool and I dont trust drunk fools
He saved me
Saved you My lady he followed my orders Every one of them And he did it all for gold Money buys a mans silence for a time A bolt in the heart buys it forever
He was helping me because I saved his life
Yes and he gave you a priceless necklace that once belonged to his grandmother The last legacy of House Hollard
I had it made a few weeks ago What did I once tell you about the capital
Were all liars here
Come my lady I know youve had a difficult day But youre safe now I promise you that Youre safe with me and sailing home
So am I the queen
More than you were with Renly Less than you would have been if Joffrey had done you the courtesy of consummating the marriage before dying In any case this would not be an opportune moment to press the issue
Clawing at his own throat looking to his mother to make stop it was horrible
The world is overflowing with horrible things But theyre all a tray of cakes next to death They brought me your grandfathers body when he died you know Made me look at it
What was it like
They took me to the Great Hall and there he was The man Id married and suffered to father my children A great doughy lump Id sat next to at endless dinners and tedious gatherings There he was lying on a table
One of my husbands preferred the company of men and was stabbed through the heart Another was happiest torturing animals and was poisoned at our wedding feast I must be cursed
Nonsense Your circumstances have improved markedly You may not have enjoyed watching him die but you enjoyed it more than you would have enjoyed being married to him I can promise you that
But I would have been the queen
Our alliance with the Lannisters remains every bit as necessary to them as it is unpleasant for us You did wonderful work on Joffrey The next one should be easier
Your brother is dead Do you know what that means
Im not trying to trick you
It means Ill become king
Yes you will become king What kind of king do you think youll be
A good king
Mm I think so as well Youve got the right temperament for it But what makes a good king Hmm What is a good kings single most important quality
This is hardly the place or the time
Holiness
Hmm Baelor the Blessed was holy And pious He built this sept He also named a sixyearold boy high septon because he thought the boy could work miracles He ended up fasting himself into an early grave because food was of this world and this world was sinful
Justice
Yeah A good king must be just Orys I was just Everyone applauded his reforms Nobles and commoners alike But he wasnt just for long He was murdered in his sleep after less than a year by his own brother Was that truly just of him To abandon his subjects to an evil that he was too gullible to recognize
No
No
What about strength
Yes Strength King Robert was strong He won the rebellion and crushed the Targaryen dynasty And he attended three small council meetings in 17 years He spent his time whoring and hunting and drinking until the last two killed him So we have a man who starves himself to death a man who lets his own brother murder him and a man who thinks that winning and ruling are the same thing What do they all lack
Wisdom
Yes
Wisdom is what makes a good king
Yes But what is wisdom Hmm A house with great wealth and fertile lands asks you for your protection against another house with a strong Navy that could one day oppose you How do you know which choice is wise and which isnt Youve any experience of treasuries and granaries or shipyards and soldiers
No
No Of course not A wise king knows what he knows and what he doesnt Youre young A wise young king listens to his counselors and heeds their advice until he comes of age And the wisest kings continue to listen to them long afterwards Your brother was not a wise king Your brother was not a good king If he had been perhaps hed still be alive Now as the king you will have to marry Do you understand why
A king needs a queen
Yes but why To further the family line Do you know how that happens
Yes
Yes but has anyone explained the details to you
I dont think so Its all relatively straightforward
How are you
Im all right
You are You will be Ill see to that
Please give the queen a moment alone with her son
Yes my lord All of you
It was Tyrion He killed him He told me he would A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth Thats what he said to me You saw it You saw Joff point at him just before he
I dont know what I saw
Avenge him Avenge our son Kill Tyrion
Tyrions my brother Our brother Therell be a trial Well get to the truth of what happened
I dont want a trial Hell squirm his way to freedom given the chance I want him dead Please Jaime You have to He was our son Our baby boy
Youre a hateful woman Why have the gods made me love a hateful woman
Jaime not here please Please
Stop it Stop it Stop
No
Stop it Stop
Stop Stop Its not right
Its not right Its not right
I dont care
Dont
I dont care
Dont Jaime dont
I dont care
Gonna rain soon Where are we
Near Fairmarket I think
You think You dont have a map
No I dont have a map
Maybe we should get one
Just point out the next map shop you see and Ill buy you one
How far is it to the Eyrie
Far
And youre sure were going the right way
Believe me girl I want you there as soon as I can Get my gold be on my way
On your way where
Why do you care Might book passage across the Narrow Sea Fight as a sellsword Second Sons could be Seems like a good fit for me
Id like to see Braavos one day
Why Braavos
I have friends there
I doubt it
Seven blessings to you
What do you want
What do I want This is my land
If Im standing on it its my land
We were just watering the horses Well be on our way Forgive my father He was wounded fighting in the war Our cottage burned down while he was gone and my mother with it
Hes never been the same
Which house did he fight for
The Tullys of Riverrun
Theres a storm coming Youll be wanting a roof tonight Theres fresh hay in the barn And Sally here makes rabbit stew just like her mom used to do We dont have much but any man that bled for House Tully is welcome to it
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy accepting our human frailty We ask the Mother to bless our crops so we may feed ourselves and all who come to our door We ask the Warrior to give us courage in these days of strife and turmoil We ask the Maiden to protect Sallys virtue to keep her from the clutches of depravity
You got to do all seven of the fuckers
Father
We ask the Smith to strengthen our hands and our backs so we may finish the work required of us We ask the Crone to guide us on our journey from darkness to darkness
And we ask the Stranger not to kill us in our beds tonight for no damn reason at all
Im so sorry
Really good
Did you fight at the Twins
Call that a fight Slaughtering livestock more like
The Red Wedding theyre calling it Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day He shared bread and salt with the Starks He offered them guest right
Guest right dont mean much anymore
It means something to me The gods will have their vengeance Frey will burn in the seventh hell for what he did Things were different when Hoster Tully ruled the Riverlands We had good years and bad years same as anyone But we were safe Now with the Freys raiders come plundering steal our food steal our silver I was gonna send Sally north to stay with my brother but the norths no better The whole countrys gone sour
You got any ale
Afraid not
How can a man not keep ale in his home
You look like you could really swing that sword A real warrior with proper training Those raiders wouldnt stand a chance against you How would it be if you stayed on till the new moon I could use a man to help with the farmwork Sally does what she can but she cant lift a bale of hay And if any thieves came looking for easy pickings one look at you Id bet theyd run the other way Meaning no offense
Whatll you pay I dont have much But I have hidden a bit of silver from the bandits Fair wages for fair work
Fair wages for fair work
What did you do
Get your horse saddled
You told me you werent a thief
I wasnt
He took us in He fed us and you
Aye he took us in Hes a good man and his daughter makes a nice stew And theyll both be dead come winter
You dont know that
I do know it Hes weak He cant protect himself Theyll both be dead come winter Dead men dont need silver
Youre the worst shit in the Seven Kingdoms
Theres plenty worse than me I just understand the way things are How many Starks they got to behead before you figure it out
Raper Raper Horse thief Ninth born son Raper Thief Thief and raper
There he is Sam the Slayer
Going to visit your wildling whore
Shes not a whore
No Maybe Ill give her a copper tonight and find out
They all think Im lying
About what
Killing the white Walker
Youre not lying Ill never forget the way it screamed
But youre the only one that saw it And they all think youre just a
A what
Well a wildling
My father hated that word
Its not a very nice word I suppose
I dont know It makes me sound a bit dangerous doesnt it
So are you all right No one bothering you
I get a lot of looks I hear them making their jokes But no ones touched me if thats what you mean
I worry about it sometimes All the time
Why do you worry about it
100 men one woman
Theyve got other things to think about
Thats the only thing they think about
Youre being silly
Im not being silly Theres 100 men lying awake at night picturing you
What about you
What about me Gilly I worry about you
Thank you
For what
For worrying about me
I dont know if youre safe here Theyre my brothers but some of them were thieves before they came here Some of them were rapers You saw what they did at your fathers keep
So what are you saying
Maybe youd be safer in Moles Town
Are you bored of me
Bored of you I I want to protect you
Ill get these to Hobb Keep an eye on little Sam
Your Grace
Youre a literary man now What do you make of that
Joffrey
The usurper Joffrey Baratheon I said those words when I tossed a leech into the fire A leech filled with bastard blood A bastard you set free I am now faced with a great opportunity and I am powerless to take advantage of it
I will find you an army Your Grace Ive been working day and night
What progress have you made
Ive rallied House Peasebury to your cause
House Peasebury
House Musgood
House Musgood
And House Haigh
House Haigh They dont have enough men between them to raid a pantry
Westeros is not the world Your Grace We need to look east for ships and men 10000 skilled soldiers fight for the Golden Company
The Golden Company
Theyve never broken a contract
Theyre sellswords
Were willing to use blood magic to put you on the throne but were not willing to pay men to fight Now the Red Womans magic is real Her visions and prophecies may be too but Ive never heard of visions and prophecies winning a war Soldiers win wars Soldiers on the ground Its dirty on the ground
We dont have any gold
Not yet
If I do not press my claim my claim will be forgotten I will not become a page in someone elses history book Im running out of time Ser Davos Which means youre running out of time
Youre late
Im sorry Princess
I thought you werent coming
The Hand of the King doesnt have much leisure time
You wont be a very good Hand if you see the word knight and say kanigit
That happened once weeks ago Youre your fathers daughter no mistake Bloody relentless the both of you
Its a new one today Lots of tricky words But I think you can manage
Youll never read well if you move your lips Thats how children do it
The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos
Thank you very much
I like this one Its full of sword fights and pirates You were a pirate once
No I was never a pirate I was a smuggler
Whats the difference
Well if youre a famous smuggler youre not doing it right
My father says a criminal is a criminal
Your father lacks an appreciation of the finer points of bad behavior So do the Braavosi
Youve sailed to Braavos
Of course Almost got beheaded by a First Sword of Braavos I tried to explain to him the difference between pirates and smugglers but he didnt seem any more interested in the distinction than your father I suppose if you work for the Iron Bank of Braavos and each one of your gold barges is worth half a kingdom you tend not to be overly concerned with the kind of distinction
What was that for
I need you to write a message
You should write it yourself Its good practice
Its too important for me I need a smart person to do it Go on
To the offices of the Iron Bank of Braavos from Stannis Baratheon the one true king of Westeros
But thats not you
I need to get their attention Go on Write
Hes seen some adventures hasnt he
Precious little thing
Thank you
Whats his name
Sam
Lovely That the daddy
No
Wheres the daddy
Hes dead
Oh Where you from
North of here
North of here You a fucking wildling
Only room and board
Thats right Shell clean and cook and look after the other girls babies
Could find other work for her too
No other work
Thered be money Give you a piece of it
No other work
I promise to come back and visit whenever I can Youll be safer here Whos gonna protect you at Castle Black Me
You protected me north of the Wall
This is different Theyre brothers of the Nights Watch and I cant just stab them in the back and I cant run away which is what we did at Crasters
You have to trust me Its for the best
Best for you
Oh Gilly Please dont
Greedy
No
Im sorry Youre lovely I just never acquired the taste
Youre calling my beauty an acquired taste
Thats quite all right lover Its more for you
Your loss
You like them both the same Boys and girls
Does that surprise you
Everyone has a preference
Then everyone is missing half the worlds pleasure The gods made that and it delights me The gods made this and it delights me When it comes to war I fight for Dorne When it comes to love I dont choose sides
I hope I have as much stamina when Im your age
What are you 25
Children
Someday if youre lucky you will wake up and realize you are old That pretty ass of yours will sag Your belly will grow soft and your back will ache in the night and gray hairs will sprout from your ears No one will want you anymore Make sure you fucked your fill before that day
Did you
He is a prince of Dorne Girls and boys will line up to fuck him till the day he dies
They will all have to line up behind you
Prince Oberyn
Lord Tywin
May we have the room
Call my name if you need me lover
Would you like to sit
No thank you
Some wine
No thank you
Im sorry about your grandson
Are you
I dont believe that a child is responsible for the sins of his father Or his grandfather An awful way to die
Which way is that
Are you interrogating me Lord Tywin
Some believe the king choked
Some believe the sky is blue because we live inside the eye of a blueeyed giant The king was poisoned
I hear you studied poisons at the Citadel
I did This is why I know
Your hatred for my family is rather well known You arrive at the capital an expert in poisoning some days later my grandson dies of poisoning
Rather suspicious Why havent you thrown me in a dungeon
You spoke with Tyrion in this very brothel on the day that you arrived What did you discuss
You think we conspired together
What did you discuss
The death of my sister
For which you blame me
She was raped and murdered by the Mountain The Mountain follows your orders Of course I blame you
Here I stand unarmed unguarded Should I be concerned
You are unarmed and unguarded because you know me better than that I am a man of reason If I cut your throat today I will be drawn and quartered tomorrow
Men at war commit all kinds of crimes without their superiors knowledge
So you deny involvement in Elias murder
Categorically
I would like to speak with the Mountain
Im sure he would enjoy speaking with you
He might not enjoy it as much as he thinks he would
I could arrange for this meeting
But you want something in return
There will be a trial for my son And as custom dictates three judges will render a verdict I will preside Mace Tyrell will serve as the second judge I would like you to be the third
Why
Not long ago the Tyrells sided with Renly Baratheon Declared themselves enemies of the throne Now they are our strongest allies
Well you made the Tyrell girl a queen Asking me to judge at your sons trial isnt quite as tempting
I will also invite you to sit on the small council to serve as one of the new kings principal advisors
I never realized you had such respect for Dorne Lord Tywin
We are not the Seven Kingdoms until Dorne returns to the fold The king is dead The Greyjoys are in open rebellion A wildling army marches on the Wall And in the East a Targaryen girl has three dragons Before long she will turn her eyes to Westeros Only the Dornish managed to resist Aegon Targaryen and his dragons
Youre saying you need us That must be hard for you to admit
We need each other You help me serve justice to the kings assassins and I will help you serve justice to Elias
Podrick Apologies for the stench
I brought you some wine my lord but they took it from me
A noble effort
They didnt find the candles though A quill some parchment duck sausage almonds and some hard cheese
Youre a good lad Any word of Shae
Ive heard nothing my lord
I suppose thats a good thing What are they saying about me out there
Youre to stand trial in a fortnight for murdering the king
Do you believe I murdered Joffrey
No my lord You didnt
No Gods no The world is a better place without him but I had nothing to do with it I would like to think if I were arranging a royal assassination Id plan it in such a way that I wouldnt be standing there gawking like a fool when the king died Trial in a fortnight Have they announced the judges yet
Your father
Of course
Mace Tyrell
Who will vote exactly as my father tells him to vote
And Prince Oberyn of Dorne
Oberyn Give it to my father He never fails to take advantage of a family tragedy
Im supposed to get a list of names from you my lord Anyone who might testify on your behalf
Oh I can call my own witnesses How generous of them Very well my wife Sansa
My lord shes gone
Gone
No ones seen her since the wedding You dont think she
No one had more cause to kill Joffrey than Sansa but the girl is no assassin Whoever killed the king wanted me to lose my head for it And with my wifes disappearance it makes me seem that much more guilty Podrick
Yes my lord
Theyll be following you now
Who will
I dont know They They The ominous they The man pulling the strings Or woman My father Maybe Joffrey was too much work for him Sweet Tommen will be so much easier to handle Whenever something bad happens to me I assume its my sister that had a hand in it But say what you will of Cersei she loves her children She is the only one Im certain had nothing to do with this murder Which makes it unique as Kings Landing murders go
Any other witnesses my lord
Varys could vouch for me if he dared
Hes already been called as a witness for the queen
Of course Fetch Bronn I have a job for him
Ive already asked my lord They wont let him see you
Why not
They say hes a known cutthroat and your close associate Hes under investigation himself
And my brother Will they at least allow me to see Jaime
Ill ask my lord
Theres something else my lord A man I didnt know his face he came to ask if Id testify against you Said Id be named Ser Podrick Payne if I told the judges youd bought a poison called the Strangler
Ser Podrick Payne Has a nice ring to it What did you tell him
I didnt tell them anything my lord
Are you going to accept their offer
My lord
Testifying against me wasnt a suggestion If they cant tempt you with honey theyll choose something less sweet
Youve been good to me my lord
Pod the trials in a fortnight Theyll want an answer before that
I already gave them an answer my lord
I will not have you dying on my behalf Do you hear me If I have to take that long walk to the executioners block I dont want to see your head already mounted
My lord
Pod I am giving you an order Go and find my brother Tell him I need him And get yourself out of Kings Landing before its too late Pod This is farewell
Farewell my lord
Pod There has never lived a more loyal squire
Mother says its time to eat
Whats she got boiling Wait Wait Let me guess
Potatoes
Potatoes Well no one boils a potato better than your mom Has she got
The wildlings
Guymon Hide Hide
You know how to get to Castle Black
Yes Yes
Those your parents Open your eyes Im going to eat them Do you hear me Im going to eat your dead mama and Im going to eat your dead papa Go tell the crows at Castle Black
We need to teach them a lesson about the way we deal with their kind
Aye Aye
Three dozen bodies with slit throats tossed off the top of the Wall Seems like that would be a good lesson
Aye
If we go after them well be giving them what they want They want to draw us out pick us off a few at a time
We have just over 100 men And thats including stewards and builders And me We cant afford to lose a single man We must remember our first responsibility We are the watchers on the Wall
Theres got to be a way to protect them
Youre a champion of the common people Lord Snow What do you say to Brother Pyps proposition
Mance Rayder is coming If the wildlings breach the Wall theyll roll over everything and everyone for 1000 Miles before they reach an army that can stop them
We need to shore up Castle Black and we need to defend the Wall That is our job
Rangers returning
Help him
Thought youd have blue eyes by now
What took you so long
We were held up
By what
Chains
We were guests of the mutineers at Crasters Keep
And the mutineers stayed
Theyre not going anywhere Theyve got Crasters food and his wives Poor girls Never thought theyd miss their daddy Karls running things now Hes the one who put a knife through Crasters mouth
We need to ride north and kill them all
We just went over this boy Justice can wait
Its not about justice I told the wildlings we had over 1000 men at Castle Black alone Karl and the others know the truth as well as we do How long do you think theyll keep that information to themselves when the wildlings are peeling their fingernails off Mance has all he needs to crush us he just doesnt know it yet As soon as he gets his hands on them he will Then hell throw his full strength at us And even if every one of us kills 100 wildlings theres still not a thing we can do to stop them
I dont think I can kill 100 wildlings
Are they attacking
A single rider A champion of Meereen They want you to send your own champion against him
What is he doing
I believe he means to
He says that were an army of men without man parts He claims you are no woman at all but a man who hides his cock in his own asshole
Ignore him Your Grace These are meaningless words
Theyre not meaningless if half the city you intend to take is listening to them
I have something to say to the people of Meereen First I will need this one to be quiet Do I have a champion
Allow me this honor mother of dragons I will not disappoint you
You are the commander of the Unsullied I cannot risk you
Your Grace Ive won more single combats than any man alive
Which is why you must remain by my side
Ive been by your side longer than any of them Khaleesi Let me stand for you today as well
You are my most trusted advisor my most valued general and my dearest friend I will not gamble with your life
I was the last to join your army Im not your general or a member of your Queensguard or the commander of your Unsullied My mother was a whore I come from nothing And before long I will return to nothing Let me kill this man for you
Very well You have quite an audience Make it worth their while
He is very brave Your Grace
Yes win or lose as long as the whole city is watching
You sure you dont want a horse
Why would I want a horse
Horses are faster than men
Horses are dumber than men
I am Daenerys Stormborn
Your Masters may have told you lies about me or they may have told you nothing It does not matter I have nothing to say to them Only to you First I went to Astapor Those who were slaves in Astapor now stand behind me free Next I went to Yunkai Those who were slaves in Yunkai now stand behind me free Now I have come to Meereen I am not your enemy Your enemy is beside you
Your enemy steals and murders your children Your enemy has nothing for you but chains and suffering and commands I do not bring commands I bring you a choice And I bring your enemies what they deserve Forward
Fire
My name is Grey Worm I come from the Summer Ills
Isles Summer Isles
Summer Isles
I am from an island called Naath
When they took you
When did they take me I was five years old
You remember your home
I remember when they rowed us away from shore How white the beaches were How tall the trees And I remember my village burning Smoke rising into the sky Do you remember your home
Unsullied Always Unsullied Before Unsullied nothing
Thats not true Perhaps one day you will return to the Summer Isles
I dont want return
Kill the masters
Kill the masters
How are the lessons coming
Very well Your Grace
Missandei is teacher good my queen
Youll have to continue later Its time
You heard her She said she came to free us
You are a fool The masters are too strong
She will protect us She defeated the masters champion
She has a great army You want to live the rest of your days in chains
I want to live You saw what they did to those children What do you think theyll do to us
Ive been through two slave revolts boy They always end the same way the Masters in power and the slaves dead
All men must die
But I promise you a single day of freedom is worth more than a lifetime in chains
Who are you
This one is called Grey Worm I was taken as a baby by the Masters of Astapor raised and trained as Unsullied Now I fight for Daenerys the Mother of Dragons and Breaker of Chains
You are Unsullied They taught you how to fight before you could walk We are not soldiers
We have no training weapons
There are three slaves in this city for every Master No one can give you your freedom brothers If you want it you must take it
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa Mhysa
Mhysa Mhysa
Remind me Ser Jorah how many children did the Great Masters nail to mileposts
163 Khaleesi
Yes that was it
Your Grace may I have a word The city is yours All these peopletheyre your subjects now Sometimes it is better to answer injustice with mercy
I will answer injustice with justice
What the hell was that
That was me knocking your ass to the dirt with your own hand
Youre a rare talent When youre fighting cripples anyway
You learned to fight like a good little boy Ill bet that thrust through the MadKings back was pretty as a picture You want to fight pretty or you want to win
You talk to my brother this way
All the time He got used to it
Do you think he did it
No Oh he hated the little twat sure But who didnt And poisons not his style Or murder for that matter You want to know for sure why dont you ask him
You havent been to see him yet eh
Were done for today
Your brother ever tell you how I came into his service
You stood for him in his trial by combat at the Eyrie
Aye But only when Lady Arryn demanded the trial take place that day You were his first choice He named you for his champion because he knew you would ride day and night to come fight for him You gonna fight for him now
To tell you the truth this isnt so bad Four walls A pot to piss in I was chained to a wooden post covered in my own shit for months
Is that supposed to make me feel better
Maybe a bit Im sorry I didnt come sooner
Its complicated yes So how is our sister
How do you think Her son died in her arms
Her son
Dont You know whats coming
My trial for regicideYes I know I know the whole bloody country thinks Im guilty I know that one of my three judges has wished me dead more times than I can count And that judge is my father As for Cersei well shes probably working on a way to avoid a trial altogether by having me killed
Now that you mention it she did ask
So should I turn around and close my eyes
Depends Did you do it
ingslayer brothers You like it I like it Youre really asking if I killed your son
Are you really asking if Id kill my brother How can I help you
Well you could set me free
You know I cant
Then theres really nothing else to say
What do you want me to do Kill the guards Sneak you out of the city in the back of a cart Im the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
Sorry Id forgotten Id hate for you to do something inappropriate
Inappropriate Youre accused of killing the kingFreeing you is treason
Except I didnt do it
Which is why were having a trial A trial If the killer threw himself before the Iron Throne confessed to his crimes and gave irrefutable evidence of his guilt it wouldnt matter to Cersei She wont rest until my heads on a spike
Not just yours Shes offering a knighthood to whomever finds Sansa Stark
Sansa couldnt have done this She had more reason than anyone in the Seven Kingdoms Do you think its a coincidence she disappeared the same night Joffrey died
No but Sansas not a killer Not yet anyway
Where are you taking me
Im getting married to your Aunt Lysa Shes waiting for us at the Eyrie Youll be safe there
Did you kill Joffrey
Did I kill Joffrey Ive been in the Vale for weeks
I know it was you
And who helped me with this conspiracy
Well there was Ser Dontos You used him to get me out of Kings Landing but you would never trust him to kill the king
Why not
Because youre too smart to trust a drunk
Then perhaps it was your husband
No
How do you know
I just do
Youre right He wasnt involvedi n Joffreys death But you were Do you remember that lovely necklace Dontos gave you I dont suppose you noticed that a stone was missing after the feast
The poison I dont understand The Lannisters gave you wealth power Joffrey made you the Lord of Harrenhal
A man with no motive is a man no one suspects Always keep your foes confused If they dont know who you are or what you want they cant know what you plan to do next
I dont believe you If they catch you theyll put your head on a spike just like my fathers Youd risk that just to confuse them
So many men they risk so little They spend their lives avoiding danger And then they die Id risk everything to get what I want
And what do you want
Everything My friendship with the Lannisters was productive But Joffrey a vicious boy with a crown on his head is not a reliable ally And who could trust a friend like that
Who could trust you
I dont want friends like me My new friends are predictable Very reasonable people As for what happened to Joffrey well that was something my new friends wanted very badly Nothing like a thoughtful gift to make a new friendship grow strong
I cant believe youre going Leaving me alone here with these people
The time has come my dear Theres nothing more tedious than a trial Except perhaps these gardens If I have to take one more leisurely stroll through these gardens Ill fling myself from the cliffs
Have you been to see Tommen yet
No Have they even agreed to the match No one tells me anything
I wasnt originally meant to marry your grandfather Luthor you know He was engaged to my sister your greataunt Viola I was to be given to some Targaryen or other Marrying a Targaryen was all the rage back then But the momentI saw my intended with his twitchy little ferrets face and ludicrous silver hair I knew he wouldnt do So the evening before Luthor was to propose to my sister I got lost on my way back from my embroidery lesson and happened upon his chamber
How absentminded of me
Mmhmm
The following morning Luthor never made it down the stairs to propose to my sister cause the boy couldnt bloody walk
And once he could the only thing he wanted was what Id given him the night before I was good I was very very good You are even better But you need to act quickly Cersei may be vicious but shes not stupid Shell turn the boy against you as soon as she can And by the time youre married itll be too late Luckily for you the Queen Regent is rather distracted at the moment mourning her dear departed boy Accusing her brother of his murder which he didnt commit
Well he could have done
He could have donebut he didnt
You dont know Grandmother
But I do know You dont think Id let you marry that beast do you
What I dont understand
Shh Dont you worry yourself about all that You just do what needs to be done
Bring it through And again
Very nice Good
A lot of wildlings fight with a weapon in each hand First thing you want to do is disarm them to try and even the odds
Lets see what you can do
Olly you just watch for now
I can fight
Have you ever held a sword before I was the best archer in our hamlet
I was
I believe you Well go hunting for rabbits one day Right now watch and learn
You two Take it slow try and disarm each other
You know how to fight You could have gone easier on him
He wouldnt have learned anything that way
Lord Snow What do you think youre doing
Grenn and I were helping them
Grenns a rangerYoure a steward Maybe you forgot that while you were off with your wildling bitch but I didnt
Someone has to train them
And that someone isnt you Go find a chamber pot to empty Go on Do it You traitors bastard Give me an excuse Mormonts not hereto protect you now
Get back to work Now I said now
The bastards welllikedYoure not
You think I care if they like me Were at war
For now But you cant be acting commander forever There will be a choosing The old maester will insist on it You might reconsider his request to marchon Crasters Let the mutineer stake care of Snow Or you might be taking orders from him the rest of your life
A bastard eh Took you for highborn
My father was highborn My mother wasnt
Names Locke
Jon Snow
You fight well
What brought you up here A sense of duty I wanted to do my part for the safety of the realm I was a game warden in the Stormlands Fed a prized partridge to my hungry kids I was stupid enough to get caught Chose the Wall over losing my hand Figured I wouldnt have to suck up to any highborn cunts here
Come on get on with it What are you waiting for Summer
Guess I was wrong
You sent for me Your Grace
Your Grace How formal of you How many Kingsguards are posted outside Tommens door
Ser Boros is on duty tonight Tomorrow I believe
So one You have one man guarding the future king
I promise you Tommens safe Were protecting him
The way you protected Joffrey Why did Catelyn Stark set you free
What
Ive been wondering for months Ever since that great cow brought you back to the capital Why did she set you free
You know why Shed hoped Id send her daughters back to her
She hoped or did you promise
I swore by all the gods that if her daughters were alive Id return them to her
So you made a sacred vow to the enemy
I wanted to get back to you Should I have told hert o fuck off
You didnt mean it then You have no loyalty to Catelyn Stark
Catelyn Starks dead So if I told you to leave the capital right now and find Sansa if I told you to find that murderous little bitch and bring me her head would you do it
I know you went to see Tyrion That creature who murdered our son
I had to see him I had to know for myself
And
He didnt do it Cersei
Youve always pitied him Our poor little brother Abused by the world Despised by his father and sister Hed kill us all if he could I want four men at Tommens door day and night That will be all Lord Commander
Ser Pounce
How did you get past the Kingsguard
Kingsguard
I dont think youre supposed to be here Mother doesnt allow me to have visitors at night
Im not a visitor Your Grace Word has itIm to be your bride
Did you know that people in arranged marriages often never meet until their wedding day Before we decide to spend our lives together we ought to get to know one another Dont you think
Yes But if my mother found out
It can be our secret Hmm If were going to be man and wife well have a few secrets from her I hope So Your Grace
Yes Tell me a secret
Hello Arent you a proper fellow
Thats Ser Pounce
Very handsome
Joffrey didnt like him He threatened to skin him alive and mix his innards up in my food so I wouldnt know I was eating him
Thats very cruel You dont strike me as cruel
No I dont think I am
Thats a relief Because you know what happens when we marry
We say our vows in front of the High Septon And after the ceremony theres a feast
When we marry I become yours Forever Its getting late I should go May I come and visit you again All right then
Remember our little secret
Ser Jaime Lannister Knighted and named to the Kingsguard in his 16th year At the sack of Kings Landing murdered his king Aerys II Pardoned by Robert Baratheon Thereafter known as the Kingslayer
Its the duty of the Lord Commander to fill those pages And theres still room left on mine
Valyrian steel
Mmm Its yours
I cant accept this
It was reforged from Ned Starks sword Youll use it to defend Ned Starks daughter You swore an oath to return the Stark girls to their mother Lady Starks dead Aryas probably dead too but theres still a chance to find Sansa and get her somewhere safe Ive got something else for you
I hope I got your measurements right
Ill find her For Lady Catelyn And for you
I almost forgot I have one more gift
I dont need a squire
Of course you do
Hell slow me down
My brother owes him a debt Hes not safe here Youre keeping him from harm Its chivalry
I wont slow you down ser my lady I promise Ill serve you well
See Hes a good ladYoull get along
Compliments of Lord Tyrion His axe from the Blackwater
What are you waiting for a kiss Ready the ladys horse
They say the best swords have names Any ideas
Oathkeeper
Goodbye Brienne
Come on move
I should neverhave taken her away
She wasnt safe here
Shes not safe out there I should have known You told us there were wildlings south of the Wall If theyre raiding the smaller villages Moles Town could be next
Castle Black could be next
I should go back for Gilly
We have orders No ones to leave the castle
I remember when you disobeyed orders and rode south to help Robb
And I remember who came after me and brought me home I know how hard it is Sam believe me When you told me about Bran going beyond the Wall all I could think about was getting my strength back so I could go and find him
I wish I could have convinced him to come back with me I tried Really I did
How fast could they travel A crippled boy being pulled on a sledge by a simpleton
I dont know Theyd pass wildling villages They could try to find shelter at one of them
The wildlings have joined up with Mance Every village or sheltered place will be deserted Except
Crasters You think Bra nmight have found
Snow I dont mean to interrupt Thorne wants to see you
Your foray to Crasters Keep Ill sanction it But I wont order anyone to go with you Volunteers only
Thank you Ser Alliser
Ahem brothers
Im going beyond the Wallto Crasters Keep Im going to capture the mutineers holed up there or kill them Im asking for volunteers to come with me Theres 60 miles of wilderness between here and Crasters and Mance Rayder has an army bearing down on us but we have to do this Our survival may depend on us getting to these mutineers before Mance does They know the Wall They know our defenses If Mance learns what they know were lost But if thats not enough then consider this If the Nights Watch are truly brothers then Lord Commander Mormont was our father He lived and died for the Watch and he was betrayed by his own men Stabbed in the back by cowards He deserved far better All we can give him now is justice Who will join me
I cant let a recruit come north of the Wall
Then let me say my vows If its a fight youre heading for then you need men who know how
Thank you brothers
No dont Dont please
Please dont Ow Youre hurting me
Karl Tanner from Gin Alley drinking wine from the skull of Jeor fucking Mormont

And I thought this was gonnabe another boring day
May the Warrior grant him courage and protect him in these perilous times May the Smith grant him strength that he might bear this heavy burden And may the Crone she that knows the fate of all men show him the path he must walk and guide him through the dark places that lie ahead In the light of the Seven I now proclaim Tommen of the House Baratheon First of His Name King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms Long may he reign
Long may he reign
Special day
Your Grace
Your Grace
Your Grace
Your Grace
Your Grace
There he is
Long may he reign
Long may he reign
He sits the throne like he was born to it
Yes He wasnt though was he
No he wasnt
You still mourn for Joffrey
He was my husband My king
He would have been your nightmare
Your Grace I feel
You knew exactly what he was I did too You never love anything in the world the way you love your first child Doesnt matter what they do And what he did it shocked me Do you think Im easily shocked
No
The things he did shocked me Hes only a boy A good boy A decent boy He always has been Who was the last decent king I wonder He could be the first man who sits on that throne in 50 years to actually deserve it
It would be some consolation wouldnt it For all the horror that put him there
He will need help if hes going to rule well
He has you
A mother is not enough Youre still interested in being queen I take it
Oh After all thats happened it sounds strange I know but I am I havent even given any thought to it what comes next It would be a great honor of course But I will have to speak to my father about it
Yes speak to your father Ill speak to mine
We may be faced with an alarming number of weddings soon
I wont even know what to call you Sister Or Mother Hmm
King Joffrey Baratheon is dead Murdered at his own wedding
And we have taken the Meereenese Navy Your Grace
The Second Sons took the Meereenese Navy
Who told you to take the Navy
No one
So why did you do it
I heard you liked ships
How many ships
93 Your Grace
How many men can they carry
9300 not counting sailors
Would that be enough to take Kings Landing
The Lannisters have more
Theyve been fighting Joffreys wars for years Theyre tired dispersed And now their king is dead 8000 Unsullied 2000 Second Sons sailing into Blackwater Bay and storming the gates without warning
Its hard to say It could be enough But were not fighting to make you queen of Kings Landing 10000 men cant conquer Westeros
The old houses will flock to our queen when she crosses the Narrow Sea
The old houses will flock to whichever side they think will win as they always have
Theres other news From Yunkai Without the Unsullied to enforce your rule the Wise Masters have retaken control of the city Theyve reenslaved the freedmen who stayed behind and sworn to take revenge against you And in Astapor the council you installed to rule over the city has been overthrown by a butcher named Cleon whos declared himself His Imperial Majesty
Please leave me Not you Jorah
It appears my liberation of Slavers Bay isnt going quite as planned
You could sail for Westeros and leave it all behind A boy sits on the Iron Throne A boy many believe to be a bastard with no right to it Theyve never been more vulnerable
You counseled me against rashness once in Qarth I didnt listen That all worked out well
How can I rule seven kingdoms if I cant control Slavers Bay Why should anyone trust me Why should anyone follow me
Youre a Targaryen Youre the Mother of Dragons
I need to be more than that I will not let those I have freed slide back into chains I will not sail for Westeros
What then
I will do what queens do I will rule Outside the Aerie
Pull up your hood A memorable shade
But how would they know
You know what kind of stories poor men enjoy the most Ones about rich girls theyll never meet
Is this the only way into the Eyrie
The mountains are impassable If you want to get to the Eyrie you need to go through the Bloody Gate It doesnt matter how large your army is if you attack this gate you do it on this road three men abreast and get slaughtered like goats The first Lords of the Vale didnt have much but they had these mountains and they knew how to use them And the fortress they built here has never been overcome Not once in 1000 years Know your strengths use them wisely and one man can be worth 10000
Who would pass the Bloody Gate
Lord Petyr Baelish and his niece Alayne
Stand to
Stand to
Stand to
Welcome back Lord Baelish
Uncle Petyr
My lord
Oh I have brought you a gift
Lord Baelish
My lady
Look what Uncle Petyr brought me
A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy
Its a pleasure to make your acquaintance Lady Arryn My name is Al
Oh do take down that hood child Dont you think know who you are You think Id let my intended leave the Eyrie on urgent business without knowing what that business was I let him go so he could bring you here to me
My flesh and blood
Its wonderful to meet you Aunt Lysa
You mustnt call me that in front of anyone else
Of course I understand
No one can know youre here It would put us in a very precarious position
I would never say a thing
The Lannisters want to destroy us Theyve been trying for years Now they know what it feels like
Mummy said they killed your mother and they chopped off your brothers head
They did and my fathers
They killed my father too with poison I wanted to make the little Lannister baby man fly but Mother said I couldnt
Make him fly
Through the Moon Door
And on top of everything else they made you marry that filthy troll
They did They made us both Lord Tyrion didnt want to
I dont believe that for a moment Did he force himself on you
No We never
Good Robin this is your cousin Sansa But youre not to call her Sansa in front of anyone but Uncle Petyr and myself Do you understand Sansa this is my son Robin
Its a pleasure to meet you Robin
Robin show Sansa to her chamber Take the back stairs
Go Well speak soon
What took you so long
Arranging for the ascension of King Tommen I extricating Sansa getting her here alive
Shes here Weve spent more than enough time on her for one evening
Lets get married tonight
Ought we not inform the Lords of the Vale about the ceremony
Theres only one Lord of the Vale The others can all hang Lurking and simpering on the stairs like buzzards the moment my husband died trying to get their claws in me
I do think that we could wait until
Im done waiting Petyr We had our wedding night many years ago Or dont you remember
Like it was yesterday
What wife would do for you the things Ive done for you What wife would trust you the way Ive trusted you When you gave me those drops and told me to pour them into Jons wine my husbands wine when you told me to write a letter to Cat telling her it was the Lannisters
The deed is done Faded into nothing Only speaking of it can make it real
Tonight it is then
Let me bathe and dress for the occasion Once Im presentable Ill call on the septon immediately
Im warning you Im going to scream when my husband makes love to me Im going to scream so loud theyll hear me clear across the Narrow Sea
When will the wedding take place in your mind
As soon as decency permits After weve allowed Tommen the appropriate time to mourn his brother and Margaery to mourn her husband
A fortnight
That seems reasonable
No jugglers no jousting dwarves no 77course meals
And your wedding to Loras
Shortly after Tommens
Shortly
A fortnight
I know you dont like them I didnt like your husband Used to pat me on the back a lot I didnt trust him
We had that in common
You dont need to make formal alliances with people you trust
Then whom can we trust
Ourselves alone
The Tyrells are our only true rivals in terms of resources and we need them on our side
Robert wasnt particularly rich
Robert had me funding him Wars swallow gold like a pit in the earth
I suppose that explains why we did so well in the last one
Do you know how much gold was mined in the Westerlands this past year
Havent a clue
Go on your best guess
Pounds tons ounces
Doesnt matter The answer is the same
That cant be
Our last working mine ran dry three years ago
Then how do we pay for anything
The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money
How much
A tremendous amount
There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to come to some arrangement
The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank There is no someone
Someone does work there It is comprised of people
And a temple is comprised of stones One stone crumbles and another takes its place And the temple holds its form for 1000 years or more Thats what the Iron Bank is a temple We all live in its shadow and almost none of us know it You cant run from them You cant cheat them You cant sway them with excuses If you owe them money and you dont want to crumble yourself you pay it back Vesting the Tyrells in the crown will help a great deal in this respect
Its for the good of the family I understand that Im not sure my brothers do
I know youre building a strong case against Tyrion And as a mother that is your right But as a judge I cannot discuss the trial with you
I respect that We dont need to discuss it
The Lannister legacy is the only thing that matters Youve started wars to protect this family Turned your back on Jaime for refusing to contribute to its future What does Tyrion deserve for lighting that future on fire
Joffrey Cersei Walder Frey Meryn Trant Tywin Lannister The Red Woman Beric Dondarrion Thoros of Myr Ilyn Payne The Mountain
Would you shut up
I cant sleep until I say the names
The names of every fucking person in Westeros
Only the ones Im going to kill
Hates as good a thing as any to keep a person going Better than most We come across my brother maybe we can both cross a name off our list
If he were here right now what would you do
Id tell him to shut the fuck up so I can get some sleep Go on get it over with your list of doomed men
Im almost done Only one name left
Go on
The Hound
Thank you
Your mother always had a sweet tooth you know
Really
Oh yes At suppertime she would go straight for honey cakes candied almonds custard Anything sweet Eventually your grandfather had to assign a septa to watch her at meals Cat was the firstborn daughter after all It was important that she remain desirable so Father could arrange a good match for her and she was starting to get fat
My mother fat She never let me have my pudding until Id finished all my proper food
This is before she married your father and moved to the North By the time you were born your fathers austerity had become hers Marriage changes people I didnt mean for you to stop Go on enjoy them How do you like them
Theyre delicious Where did you get the lemons You cant grow them up here
Oh gods no Petyr had three crates brought all the way from Kings Landing He knew you liked lemon cakes Hes so kind He really cares for you Think where youd be without him In their clutches and tried for murder
Yes Im very lucky
He feels responsible for you
Oh I know he does Im so grateful
Why Why does he feel responsible for you
Well Im half Tully He loved your family so much
Loved your mother
No
Thats what you wanted to say
He loves you Aunt Lysa Hes married to you
Your mother never loved him Never Cat always went straight for the sweetest thing The most obvious thing Your Uncle Brandon Your handsome arrogant cruel Uncle Brandon He almost killed Petyr in a duel And your mother loved him anyway And now Petyr is risking his life to save you the daughter of a woman who didnt love him no more than those whores in his brothels Has he told you about them
No
He hasnt told you about the vile things they do with their bodies The vile things they let him do with their bodies
No never
Are you pregnant
What No I told you Lord Tyrion and I never
I wasnt asking about Tyrion What have you let Petyr do with your body
Aunt Lysa no I
Your young pretty body
Nothing Im a virgin
Dont lie to me
Youre hurting me
Ill know if you lie
Im a virgin I swear it He loves you Aunt Lysa All he says is that Im stupid Im a stupid little girl with stupid dreams who never learns and Im a terrible liar so I should always tell the truth And I swear to you that he has never touched me Not once not ever
Shh Shh Shh Its all right It will all be all right Youll be a widow soon Theyll execute that dwarf for murdering the king and youll be free to marry Robin Youll be the Lady of the Vale Hmm ingsroad
Didnt they teach you how to ride a horse
Yes my lady when I was young There wasnt much call for it with Lord Tyrion though He preferred litters
Perhaps you should have stayed with him Its not going to be a pleasant journey for you It could take weeks to get to the Wall depending on the weather
Thats a long way off
Well Lady Sansas brothers at Castle Black If I were her thats where Id go Feel free to stop at any point
Never my lady Im your squire
Ive made it this far in the world without a squire I dont see why I need one now
All knights have squires my lady
Im not a knight And Im not a slaver either I dont own you
I swore an oath my lady
I am releasing you from that oath That means you could leave
I know
What do you think will happen if you leave
Theyll say I wasnt a very good squire
The hell you doing
Practicing
What ways to die
No ones going to kill me
They will if you Nance around like that Thats no way to fight
Its not fighting Its water dancing
Dancing Maybe you ought to put on a dress Who taught you that shite
The greatest swordsman who ever lived Syrio Forel the First Sword to the Sealord of Braavos
Braavos Greasyhaired little bastard I bet They all are
What do you know about anything
I bet his hair is greasier than Joffreys cunt
It was not
Was He dead
Yes
How
He was killed
Who by
Meryn Trant Thats why
Meryn Trant The greatest swordsman who ever lived killed by Meryn fucking Trant
He was outnumbered
Any boy whore with a sword could beat three Meryn Trants
Syrio didnt have a sword Or armor Just a stick
The greatest swordsman who ever lived didnt have a sword All right You have a sword Lets see what he taught you Go on do it for your Braavosi friend Dead like all the rest of your friends
Your friends dead and Meryn Trants not cause Trant had armor and a big fucking sword
Your Grace
Prince Oberyn Writing letters
A poem actually
May I show you the gardens
I couldnt very well refuse a royal escort
No you couldnt
I didnt realize you were a poet
Not a very good one
For your paramour
For one of my daughters
You have several dont you
Eight
Eight Eight daughters
The fifth is difficult I named her after my sister Elia
Beautiful name
Yes But I cant say it without turning sad And after I turn sad I grow angry
Perhaps thats why shes difficult The gods love their stupid jokes dont they
Which joke is that
Youre a prince of Dorne A legendary fighter A brilliant man feared throughout Westeros But you could not save your sister Im a Lannister Queen for 19 years Daughter of the most powerful man alive But I could not save my son What good is power if you cannot protect the ones you love
We can avenge them
Yes we can avenge them
You really believe Tyrion murdered your son
I know he did
We will have a trial and we will learn the truth
Well have a trial anyway I havent seen my daughter in over a year
The last time I saw her she was swimming with two of my girls in the Water Gardens Laughing in the sun
I want to believe that I want to believe shes happy
You have my word We dont hurt little girls in Dorne
Everywhere in the world they hurt little girls Would you bring her a gift for me I wasnt there for her name day I dont know when Ill see her again
Anything at all
The best shipwrights in Kings Landing have been working on it for months Myrcella loves the open water
I will have it sailed down to Sunspear for her
Please tell her her mother misses her very much ingsroad
Oh no no no
No no no no
Hells Gods

Have you ever cooked a rabbit before
No my lady
Did you ever cook anything for Lord Tyrion
No my lady That was the cooks
What are you doing
Im helping you with your armor
Ive been removing my own armor for quite some time thank you very much
What exactly did you do for Lord Tyrion
I brought him his meals and cleared his table when he was finished I kept his clothing and linens clean Carried his messages and returned the replies Mostly I poured wine
Oh Whilst in Lord Tyrions service did you ever do anything remotely related to combat
I killed a man
Who
A Kingsguard He tried to kill Lord Tyrion at the Blackwater
How did you kill a Kingsguard
I pushed a spear through the back of his head
Bloody ridiculous Help me with these straps

You know whats wrong with honor
You

We lost four brothers

Meaning all respect Ser Crow Craster beat us and worse Your brother crows beat us and worse Well find our own way
You want to stay here in Crasters Keep
Burn it to the ground and all the dead with it
Your Grace if youd like to sit Im sure that
Weve been here since midday
Easterners have a difference sense of time Ive often found Once I was waiting for Salladhor Saan here in Braavos Together we were going to run three shiploads of the finest
Welcome to the Iron Bank Please sit
What can we do for you Lord Stannis
This is Stannis of the House Baratheon King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
The Iron Throne is currently occupied by Tommen of the House Baratheon King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm
He shares no blood with me He is a bastard born of incest As was his brother before him
Yes we have heard this story
Its not a story Its the truth
The kings grandfather tells a different story A story about a jealous uncle whose attempts to usurp the throne from the rightful king cost the Seven Kingdoms dearly in blood and gold
Gold you loaned him
And you feel your blood gives you a claim on our gold
More than any man living
Across the Narrow Sea your books are filled with words like usurper and madman and blood right Here our books are filled with numbers We prefer the stories they tell More plain Less open to interpretation How many fighting men remain loyal to you
4000
And how many ships do you have The ones still afloat Ser Davos not at the bottom of Blackwater Bay
32
And how much wheat and barley and beef and pork do you produce on Dragonstone to feed your 4000 men on your 32 ships
None
You can see why these numbers seem unlikely to add up to a happy ending from our perspective Im afraid we must respectfully decline your request But we thank you for paying us the honor of your visit
My lord
Im not a lord Ser Davos Seaworth You would not be either here In Braavos thieves are not rewarded with titles
Well strictly speaking I didnt do the thieving That would be the pirates I just moved what they stole from one place to another DAVOS removes his right glove to show the stubs of his fingers
This is the payment that was demanded by King Stannis for my crimes I consider it an honest accounting Hes an honest man and hes your best chance to get back the money youve sunk into Westeros Which is a lot I imagine Wars are expensive
The war is over
As long as Stannis lives the war is not over Whos the real power in Kings Landing
Ser Davos
Humor me
Tywin Lannister
How old is Tywin Lannister
67
67 And when he dies whos in command A halfgrown boy the product of incest Cersei Lannister a queen whose people despise her Jaime Lannister a man best known for killing the king he was sworn to protect When Tywins gone who do you back
That is a problem for another time
Begging your pardon I think its a problem for now Theres only one reliable leader left in Westeros Stannis Hes got the birthright Hes in his prime Hes a tried and tested battle commander And he doesnt just talk about paying people back he does it
The lookout sees a pirate ship sailing their way The captain shouts to his first mate Bring me my red shirt The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on And when the pirates try to board the brave captain leads his men to victory A few days later the lookout screams Two pirate ships The crew is shivering like scared mice But the courageous captain hollers Bring me my red shirt
After the battle the first mate asks Captain why do you call for your red shirt before battle The captain replies So that if I am stabbed you will not see me bleed The next morning the lookout screams 10 pirate ships We are surrounded The crew goes silent
They all look to their brave captain waiting for his usual command Calm as ever the captain bellows
Bring me my brown pants
You think they ever met a pirate who didnt tell them that joke
Davos I heard you were rotting in a dungeon in Dragonstone
Only half rotted
Join us my friend Join us This is Lhara And this is
I am Lhara
Shes an artist this one truly
No time Im afraid We sail at sunrise
We
You me we
Once I thought this man loved me Now I know he despises me He wants to see me die poor and alone on some cold
You wont be alone And you wont be poor
Theres a chest of the good stuff left back at your house I gave it to your wife
Youre not my friend my friend
Ill see you at sunrise
I give you until the full moon to order all ironborn scum out of the North and back to those shitstained rocks you call home On the first night of the full moon I will hunt down every islander still on our lands and flay them living the way I flayed the 20 ironborn scum I found at Winterfell In the box youll find a special gift Theons favorite toy He cried when I took it away from him Leave the North now or more boxes will follow with more Theon Signed Ramsay Snow natural born son of Roose Bolton Lord of the Dreadfort and Warden of the North
Yes
They skinned our countrymen and they mutilated my brother your prince Your prince Everything theyve done to him theyve also done to you
Yes Yes
As long as they can hurt our prince with impunity the word ironborn means nothing
Go left
Theon Greyjoy
I dont know
Im here for Theon Greyjoy Take me to the dungeons
Hes not in the dungeons
Last cage on the right
Thank you
This way

I have a treat for you A reward
Reward
Yes Reek Those creatures who came in the night they wanted to take you away And you didnt let them You remained loyal
I I didnt want them to take me I was so scared I didnt want them
Yes yes Reek Its a bath For you Remove those rags Now
The britches too Reek Take them off
Do you love me Reek
Yes of course my lord
Good Because I need you to do something for me Something very important Theres a castle you see Some bad men hold this castle I need your help to take this castle back
But how can
I need you to play a role To pretend to be someone youre not
Pretend to be who
Theon Greyjoy
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen the First of Her Name Queen of Meereen Queen of the Andals and the First Men Khaleesi of the Great Sea Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons Dont be afraid my friend
The Queen says you may approach and speak
He is a goatherd He says he prayed for your victory against the slave masters
I thank him for his prayers
It was your dragons he says They came this morning for his flock
He hopes he has not offended Your Grace but now he has nothing
Tell this man I am sorry for his hardship I cannot bring back his goats
but I will see he is paid their value three times over
Send the next one in
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq begs an audience with the Queen
The noble Hizdahr zo Loraq can speak to me himself
Queen Daenerys Tales of your beauty were not exaggerated
I thank you
Mine is one of the oldest and proudest families in Meereen
Then it is my honor to receive you
My father one of Meereens most respected and beloved citizens oversaw the restoration and maintenance of its greatest landmarks This pyramid included
For that he has my gratitude I should be honored to meet him
You have Your Grace You crucified him I pray youll never live to see a member of your family treated so cruelly
Your father crucified innocent children
My father spoke out against crucifying those children He decried it as a criminal act but was overruled Is it justice to answer one crime with another
I am sorry you no longer have a father but my treatment of the masters was no crime Youd be wise to remember that
Whats done is done You are the queen and I am a servant of Meereen A servant who does not wish to see its traditions eradicated
And what traditions do you speak of
The tradition of funeral rite Proper burial in the Temple of the Graces My father and 162 noble Meereenese are still nailed to those posts carrion for vultures rotting in the sun
Your Grace I ask that you order these men taken down so that they might receive proper burials
And what of the slave children these noble Meereenese crucified They were rotting in the sun as well Would you have begged me for their right to a proper burial
Your Grace I cannot defend the actions of the masters I can only speak to you as a son who loved his father Let me take his body down Let me have him brought to the temple and buried with dignity so that he might find peace in the next world
Bury your father Hizdahr zo Loraq
Thank you my queen
How many more
There are 212 supplicants waiting Your Grace
212
Send the next one in
These meetings arent always going to be this early are they I was up late last night So does this mean I am a master of something now Coins ships
Lord Tywin and I already determined that I shall be the Master of Ships long before you
Lord Tywin its a great honor to have been granted a seat on this council I
The trial begins this afternoon We only have the morning for affairs of state Shall we begin
Sandor Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands my lord
A coward and a traitor
My birds tell me the Hound slaughtered five of our soldiers I believe the phrase fuck the king was uttered
Disgraceful
What would it take to make the common soldier stupid enough to try his luck with the Hound
10 silver stags seems a generous bounty
Make it 100 What else
More whispers from the east my lord
The Targaryen girl
Daenerys has taken up residence in Meereen She has conquered the city and rules as its queen
Conquered with what
She commands an army of Unsullied my queen Some 8000 strong She has a company of sellswords the Second Sons She has two knights advising her Jorah Mormont and Barristan Selmy And she has three dragons
Baby dragons Larger every year Your Grace
Mormont is spying on her for us
No longer He appears to be fully devoted to her As for Ser Barristan it would seem he took his dismissal from the Kingsguard a bit harder than anticipated
Hes an old man He wasnt fit to protect my son
Joffrey didnt die on his watch Dismissing him was as insulting as it was stupid
Dont tell me youre worried about a child halfway across the world
A child with two seasoned warriors counseling her and a powerful army at her back Your Grace
Lord Varys is right I have been to Essos and seen the Unsullied firsthand They are very impressive on the battlefield Less so in the bedroom
Dragons havent won a war in 300 years Armies win them all the time She must be dealt with
How my lord By force
Eventually if it comes to that Can your little birds find their way into Meereen
Most certainly my Lord Hand
Mmm Lord Tyrell be a good man Fetch my quill and paper
Prince Oberyn
Lord Varys
Only Varys Im not actually a nobleman No one is under obligation to call me lord
And yet everyone does
You seem quite knowledgeable about the Unsullied Did you spend much time in Essos
Five years
May I ask why
Tis a big and beautiful world Most of us live and die in the same corner where we were born and never get to see any of it I dont want to be most of us
Most of us arent princes
You are from Essos Where Lys
I have an ear for accents Ive lost my accent entirely
I have an ear for that as well How did you get here
Its a long story
One you dont like telling people
People I trust
My paramour Ellaria she would find you very interesting You should come to the brothel and meet her We brought our own wine not the swill they serve here We have some lovely boys on retainer but
You did like boys before
Really Girls Hmm I hope you wont be offended when I say I never would have guessed
Not at all But I was never interested in girls either
What then
Nothing
Everybody is interested in something
Not me When I see what desire does to people what its done to this country I am very glad to have no part in it Besides the absence of desire leaves one free to pursue other things
Such as
Let me guess Ive been pardoned
Really
Fathers orders
Well we mustnt disappoint Father  the Iron Throne room
Kingslayer
I Tommen of the House Baratheon First of my Name King of the Andals and the First Men and Lord of the Seven Kingdoms do hereby recuse myself from this trial Tywin of the House Lannister Hand of the King Protector of the Realm will sit as judge in my stead And with him Prince Oberyn of the House Martell and Lord Mace of the House Tyrell And if found guilty may the gods punish the accused
Tyrion of the House Lannister you stand accused by the Queen Regent of regicide Did you kill King Joffrey
No
Did your wife the Lady Sansa
Not that I know of
How would you say he died then
Choked on his pigeon pie
So you would blame the bakers
Or the pigeons Just leave me out of it
The crown may call its first witness
Once wed got King Joffrey safely away from the mob the Imp rounded on him He slapped the king across the face and called him a vicious idiot and a fool It wasnt the first time the Imp threatened Joffrey Right here in this throne room he marched up those steps and called our king a halfwit Compared His Grace to the Mad King and suggested hed meet the same fate And when I spoke in the kings defense he threatened to have me killed
Oh why dont you tell them what Joffrey was doing
Silence
Pointing a loaded crossbow at Sansa Stark while you tore at her clothes and beat her
Silence You will not speak unless called upon Youre dismissed
Basilisk venom widows blood wolfsbane essence of nightshade sweetsleep tears of Lys demons dance blind eye
I think you have made your point Grand Maester You have a lot of poison in your store
Had Prince Oberyn My stores were plundered
By whom
By the accused Tyrion Lannister after he had me wrongfully imprisoned
Grand Maester you examined King Joffreys corpse Was it without question poison that killed him
Without question
This was found on the body of Dontos Hollard the kings fool He was last seen spiriting Sansa Stark the wife of the accused away from the feast She wore this necklace the day of the wedding Residue of a most rare and terrible poison was found inside
Was this one of the poisons stolen from your store
It was The Strangler A poison few in the Seven Kingdoms possess And used to strike down the most noble child the gods ever put on this good earth
I will hurt you for this A day will come when you think you are safe and happy and your joy will turn to ashes in your mouth and you will know the debt is paid
Your own brother said this to you
Shortly before the Battle of Blackwater Bay I confronted him about his plans to put Joffrey on the front lines As it turned out when the attack came Joff insisted on remaining at the battlements He believed his presence would inspire the troops
Tyrion said And you will know the debt is paid What debt
I discovered hed been keeping whores in the Tower of the Hand I asked him to confine his salacious acts to the brothel where such behavior belongs He wasnt pleased
Thank you Your Grace for the courage of your testimony
Do you remember the precise nature of this threat
Im afraid I do my lord He said Perhaps you should speak more softly to me then Monsters are dangerous and just now kings are dying like flies
And he said this to you at a meeting of the small council
Yes After we received word of Robb Starks death He didnt seem gladdened by the news Perhaps his marriage to Sansa Stark had made him more sympathetic to the northern cause
Youre excused Lord Varys
Father may I ask the witness one question
One
You once said that without me this city would have faced certain defeat You said the histories would never mention me but you would not forget Have you forgotten Lord Varys
Sadly my lord I never forget a thing
We will adjourn for now
Toll the bells in an hours time
Clear the court
Youd condemn your own son to death
Ive condemned no one The trial is not over
This isnt a trial Its a farce Cersei has manipulated everything and you know it
I know nothing of the sort
Youve always hated Tyrion
He killed his king
As did I Do you know the last order the Mad King gave me To bring him your head I saved your life so you could murder my brother
It wont be murder Itll be justice
Justice
Im performing my sworn duty as Hand of the King If Tyrion is found guilty he will be punished accordingly
Hell be executed
No hell be punished accordingly
Once you said family is what lives on All that lives on You told me about a dynasty that would last 1000 years What happens to your dynasty when Tyrion dies Im a Kingsguard forbidden by oath to carry on the family line
Im well aware of your oath
What happens to your name Who carries the lion banner into future battles Your nephews Lancel Lannister Others whose names I dont even remember
What happens to my dynasty if I spare the life of my grandsons killer
It survives through me Ill leave the Kingsguard Ill take my place as your son and heir if you let Tyrion live
Done
When the testimonys concluded and a guilty verdict rendered Tyrion will be given the chance to speak Hell plead for mercy Ill allow him to join the Nights Watch In three days time hell depart for Castle Black and live out his days at the Wall Youll remove your white cloak immediately You will leave Kings Landing to assume your rightful place at Casterly Rock You will marry a suitable woman and father children named Lannister And youll never turn your back on your family again
You have my word
And you have mine 
Not going well is it
Youre going to be found guilty
Oh you think so
When you are you need to enter a formal plea for mercy and ask to be sent to the Wall Fathers agreed to it Hell spare your life and allow you to join the Nights Watch
Ned Stark was promised the same thing and we both know how that turned out
Father is not Joffrey Hell keep his word
How do you know
Do you trust me
Keep your mouth shut No more outbursts This will all be over soon
The crown may call its next witness
State your name
Shae
Do you swear by all the gods that your testimony will be true and honest
I swear it
Do you know this man
Yes Tyrion Lannister
How do you know him
I was handmaiden to his wife Lady Sansa
This man stands accused of murdering King Joffrey What do you know of this
I know that hes guilty
He and Sansa planned it together
Silence Continue
She wanted revenge for her father her mother her brother She blamed their deaths on the king Tyrion was happy to help He hated Joffrey He hated the queen He hated you my lord
He stole poison from the Grand Maesters chamber to put in Joffreys wine
How could you possibly know all this Why would he reveal such plans to his wifes maid
I wasnt just her maid I was his whore
I beg your pardon You said you were his
His whore
How did you come to be in his service
He stole me I was with another man a knight in your lordships army But when Tyrion arrived at the camp he sent one of his cutthroats into our tent He broke the knights arm and brought me to Lord Tyrion You belong to me now he said I want you to fuck me like its my last night in this world
Silence Silence
And did you
Did I what
Fuck him like it was his last night in this world
I did everything he wanted Whatever he told me to do to him Whatever he felt like doing to me I kissed him where he wanted I licked him where he wanted I let him put himself where he wanted I was his property I would wait in his chambers for hours so he could use me when he was bored He ordered me to call him my lion so I did I took his face in my hands and said I am yours and you are mine
Shae Please dont
I am a whore Remember That was before he married Sansa After that all he wanted was her But she wouldnt let him into her bed So he promised to kill King Joffrey for her
Father I wish to confess I wish to confess
You wish to confess
I saved you I saved this city and all your worthless lives I should have let Stannis kill you all
Tyrion Do you wish to confess
Yes Father Im guilty Guilty Is that what you want to hear
You admit you poisoned the king
No of that Im innocent Im guilty of a far more monstrous crime I am guilty of being a dwarf
You are not on trial for being a dwarf
Oh yes I am Ive been on trial for that my entire life
Have you nothing to say in your defense
Nothing but this I did not do it I did not kill Joffrey but I wish that I had
Watching your vicious bastard die gave me more relief than 1000 lying whores
I wish I was the monster you think I am I wish I had enough poison for the whole pack of you I would gladly give my life to watch you all swallow it
Escort the prisoner back to his cell
I made a deal for you to keep your ungrateful head on your ungrateful neck a little while longer
Im sorry what am I grateful for The opportunity to live and die at the Wall as punishment for a crime I did not commit
You threw your life away You threw it away Its not a joke You understand that dont you
Of course its a joke just not a very funny one I couldnt I couldnt listen to her standing there telling her lies I couldnt do it
You fell in love with a whore
Yes I fell in love with a whore And I was stupid enough to think that she had fallen in love with me That deal you made it was everything Father wanted You do see that He gets you back as his heir The future Lord of the Rock And he ships me off to Castle Black out of sight at last All so perfect It felt good to take that from him He knows Im innocent and hes willing to sacrifice me anyway Hes willing to sacrifice any of us Not you Youre the golden son You could kill a king lose a hand fuck your own sister youll always be the golden son
Careful Im the last friend youve got
At least I got to tell them what they really are
Yes brilliant speech Theyll be talking about it for days to come I thought you were a realist Didnt realize youd die for pride
Dont give up on me just yet I survived one trial by combat even though you werent there to save me
I cant save you this time either My training has proved that I cant beat a stable boy with my left hand
Wheres your sense of adventure Even if you lose imagine the look on Fathers face when you fall
Our family name snuffed out with a single swing of the sword
It is tempting
Well Bronn fought for me once hell do it again If he wins I expect Ill be in his debt for the rest of my life
If he wins
Will you find him for me Who does Cersei plan on naming as a champion I hope its Ser Meryn Trant Id enjoy watching Bronn disembowel that pompous child beater
No
Go on move it
And you Come on
Mercy Please Please mercy
Ser Gregor Welcome to the capital Thank you for riding here so quickly
You seem to be in good form
Who am I fighting
Does it matter
Could be food
Could be soldiers
You shouldnt be sitting out here like this
Where else to sit Tried to walk back to my hut hurt too much Then I remembered they burned my hut down
Who were they 
I stopped asking a while ago
Thats not gonna get better
Doesnt seem so
A bad way to go Havent you had enough
Of what I know Time to go Take matters into my own hands The thought has occurred to me
So why go on
Habit
Nothing could be worse than this
Maybe nothing is worse than this
Nothing isnt better or worse than anything Nothing is just nothing
Who are you
My name is Arya Arya Stark
You her father
Her captor Bringing her to her aunt for ransom
A fair exchange that is Always held to the notion of fair exchange in all my dealings You give me I give you Fair A balance No balance anymore Could I have a drink Dying is thirsty work
Wish it were wine
So do I
Thats where the heart is Thats how you kill a man
The fuck you doing
Theres a price on your head
Guess thats what the king does when you tell him to fuck off
The kings dead He drank poisoned wine at his own wedding The bounty on you is for killing Lannister soldiers 100 silver stags
And you thought you were going to collect it Didnt think very hard did you
You were Yorens prisoners when he was taking me to the Wall He told me hed fuck me bloody with a stick
This days really not working out the way you planned He on your little list
He cant be I dont know his name
Whats your name
Rorge
Thank you
Youre learning
Rangers returning
They return
Rangers returning
Greetings
Didnt think Id see you again
All right Jon
Welcome back brother
Lord Snow
This is no place for wild beasts Lock him away or Ill let Hobb throw him in tonights stew
Come on Ghost
Mances army was closing in on Crasters Keep when we left We saw their campfires from Osrics Hill Theyll reach the Wall before the next full moon
Im surprised you didnt ride over and say hello ingbeyondtheWall is your old friend isnt he
We need to prepare
Weve been preparing
We should seal the tunnel Plug it with rocks and ice Flood it and let it freeze
And how would we range north
We wouldnt
Coward You would cut off our legs pluck out our eyes leave us cowering behind the Wall hoping for the storm to pass
We cant defend the gate against 100000 men
This castle has stood for thousands of years The Nights Watch has defended her for thousands of years And in all those centuries we have never sealed the tunnel
Have you ever seen a giant Ser Alliser I have
The bars on those gates are four inches thick Coldrolled steel
They wont stop them
Remind me which order you belong to Lord Snow
The stewards
Are the stewards responsible for maintaining the tunnel
No
Who would that be
The builders
Ah the builders First Builder Yarwyck Lord Snow here recommends sealing the tunnel leaving us unable to carry out our duties as sworn brothers of the Nights Watch Do you agree with him
No
Given your deep knowledge of the wildling army Lord Snow you and Tarly will take night duties atop the Wall until the full moon
Moving on First Builder well need 100 barrels of pitch brought atop the wall
Aye
My lord
You have new clothes
Do you like em Eh Gloves are doeskin Softer than a virgins thighs
I sent for you days ago
Ive been a bit busy
Doing what
My lonesome bachelor days are over Im to wed Lollys Stokeworth
Lollys Stokeworth She doesnt strike me as your sort of girl
I wouldnt say I had a single sort of girl
Shes dimwitted
If I wanted wits Id marry you
When my sister arranged this love match did she mention that Lollys has an older sister
Falyse Aye I did know about the older sister
And you understand the rules of inheritance
Falyse is 40 and barren
She still gets Castle Stokeworth when her father dies
She does Unless she happens to perish before her father Then Lollys gets the castle
What Ladies fall from their horses and snap their pretty necks all the time
You and my sister deserve each other Why did you bother to come here
You once said if anyone ever asked me to sell you out youd double their price
Is it two wives you want or two castles
One of each will do But if you want me to kill the Mountain for you itd better be a damn big castle
Im a bit short on castles at the moment But I can offer you gold and gratitude
I have gold What can I buy with gratitude
You might be surprised A Lannister always pays his debts
Your sisters a Lannister too
My wife is heir to Winterfell If I emerge from this with my head still on my shoulders I may one day rule the North in her name I could carve you out a big piece of it
If and may and could Its bloody cold up north Lollys is soft and warm And close If I gave you the choice between fucking Lollys and fighting the Mountain youd have your britches down and your cock out before I could blink
Does he frighten you so much
Id be a bloody fool if he didnt frighten me Hes freakish big and freakish strong And quicker than youd expect for a man of that size Maybe I could take him dance around until hes so tired of hacking at me he dropped his sword get him off his feet somehow But one misstep and Im dead Why should I risk it
Because youre my friend
Aye Im your friend And when have you ever risked your life for me
I like you pampered little shit that you are I just like myself more
I understand
Im sorry it has to be this way
Why are you sorry Because youre an evil bastard with no conscience and no heart Thats what I liked about you in the first place
We had some good days together
Yes we did
What will you do
I suppose Ill have to kill the Mountain myself Wont that make for a great song
I hope to hear them sing it one day
How did you get in here Your door is well guarded
but your window is not
I swam to an island a mile offshore for these
Dont do that again
Never met a woman who didnt like wildflowers
These are my private quarters If I want you here I will summon you
Forgive me my queen I live to serve you
Tell me why youre here
I came to ask a favor I only have two talents in this world war and women You are staying here in Meereen to rule That is a wise decision I respect it But here in Meereen I cannot pursue my talents
Ive ordered the Second Sons to patrol the streets to stop the revenge killing
Youve ordered us to be night watchmen
And as for women there are thousands in Meereen you can pursue
There is only one and she does not want me
You swore me your sword
My sword is yours till the day I die
So if I command you to stay in Meereen and patrol the streets
Ill stay in Meereen and patrol the streets Send me to kill your enemies Any enemy anywhere Let me do what I do best
Very well
Do what you do best
Take off your clothes
Oh
Come in my queen Please
I didnt mean to disturb you my lady
You could never disturb me
I just wanted to speak with you before we left
Could you bring me that vial over there The blue one
No no no Not that one You dont even want to touch that one Next to it Thats the one
When I looked into the flames this morning the Lord spoke to me He said Tonight you will have your last good bath in a long while Make it count A joke Not a very good one Im afraid
It was I humor isnt my strength
Thats because most jokes are lies and youre devoted to the truth
If theyre lies my lady arent they best avoided
Not always
Most of these powders and potions are lies Deceptions to make men think they witnessed our Lords power Once they step into his light they will see the lie for what it was a trick that lead them to the truth A pinch of this powder in a bonfire will send a flaming column screaming towards the sky And this one creates a black smoke that will make the bravest man piss himself with fear And a drop of this in any mans wine will drive him wild with lust
Did you use it with Stannis
No Dont be upset Men never crave what they already have
Its only flesh It needs what it needs
No act done in service of the Lord can ever be called a sin I thank God every day for bringing you to us And Stannis to you He wants to bring Shireen with us I think that would be illadvised My daughter has heretical tendencies as youre well aware I dont know if her doubt is real or simply meant to spite me but whichever the case she should stay home
I understand how you feel
Hmm
But that is impossible
Why
You dont need powders and potions my queen You dont need lies You are strong enough to look into the Lords light and see his truth for yourself
However harsh it is However hard for us to understand You dont need my help but I will need yours soon When we set sail your daughter must be with us The Lord needs her
Jorah the Andal Are you here to see our queen Shes in a good mood
Khaleesi
Youre here early
Later than some
You dont approve
Its not a question of approval its a question of trust
You neither approve nor trust
Why would I The mans a sellsword
Didnt you fight for the Golden Company before pledging your sword to my brother
I did
I trust you
Daario Naharis killed his captains and dumped their heads at your feet when he grew tired of their commands How could you ever have faith in a man like that
I could never have faith in a man like Daario Thats why Ive sent him and the Second Sons to retake Yunkai
You have
I have
Without you there to rule Khaleesi I fear the masters will simply bide their time wait for the invaders to leave and reassert control
That is why Ive ordered Daario to execute every master in Yunkai The masters tear babies from their mothers arms They mutilate little boys by the thousands They train little girls in the art of pleasuring old men They treat men like beasts as you said yourself
Herding the masters into pens and slaughtering them by the thousands is also treating men like beasts The slaves you freed brutality is all theyve ever known If you want them to know something else youll have to show it to them
And repay the slavers with what Kindness A fine A stern warning
Its tempting to see your enemies as evil all of them but theres good and evil on both sides in every war ever fought
Let the priests argue over good and evil Slavery is real I can end it I will end it And I will end those behind it
I sold men into slavery Khaleesi
And now you are helping me show them to freedom
I wouldnt be here to help you if Ned Stark had done to me what you want to do to the masters of Yunkai
The man who came to me the other day about burying his father
Hizdahr zo Loraq
He will accompany the Second Sons and serve as my ambassador to Yunkai He will tell the masters what has happened in Meereen He will explain the choice they have before them They can live in my new world or they can die in their old one
Well go and catch Daario before he leaves Tell him I changed my mind
Yes Khaleesi
No Tell him you changed my mind
Rat cunts Fucking whore
Youre doing it wrong You need to burn away that horrible bit there Otherwise its gonna get infected and fester I know you dont like fire but if you dont do it right
No fire
Itll only take a second It wont hurt that much
No fire
Shut up about it Shut up about everything Thanks to you Im a walking bag of silver anywhere the Lannisters hold sway Which is everywhere between where we are now and where were going
Im as stupid as that hog you stuck back in the village getting myself cut and stabbed and bitten No reward is worth this much trouble Wish Id never laid eyes on you You say your brother gave you that sword
My brother gave me this It was just like you said a while back Pressed me to the fire like I was a nice juicy mutton chop
Why
Thought I stole one of his toys I didnt steal it I was just playing with it The pain was bad The smell was worse But the worst thing was that it was my brother who did it My father who protected him told everyone my bedding caught fire You think youre on your own
Let me wash it out and help you sew it up at least
Bit of comfort never hurt anyone Weve been sleeping in ditches the last few weeks I think we can treat ourselves to a featherbed for the night and a hot meal not cooked by you
Couldnt agree more my lady
Just dont start expecting silk underclothes Not working for your former lord any longer
Yes my lady
Dont get drunk
No my lady
Can I get you anything else
No this will do nicely thank you Kidney pie is wonderful
Thanks I do my best
A good kidney pie is all about the ingredients Flour lard water eggs milk Easy enough But the meat peacetime or not getting your hands on a good bottom round steak and calves kidneys is not easy I mean some people settle for plain old beef kidneys Got no right to cook anything them Oh and the gravy Dont get me started on the gravy Very difficult to get right See a lot of people give up on the gravy You cannot give up on the gravy No gravy no pie Simple as that Thats nice armor Are you a knight
No
Oh its just people with armor are usually knights Generally speaking From Kings Landing though arent you From there myself originally Flea Bottom born and bred What brings you to these parts
Were looking for someone
Someone in particular Maybe they came in here A lot of people come in here Just the other day we had 17
A girl tall red hair very pretty Her name is Sansa Stark but she may be using a different name
Starks What like them lot from Winterhell 
sNo aint seen anyone like that I heard they was all traitors Dont need no traitors in here
I pledged my life to their mother Catelyn Stark I swore to her Id bring her daughters home
Sure I cant get you a bit more kidney pie
What
Its nothing my lady
You wouldnt be screwing your face up like that if it was nothing
Dont want to offend my lady Truly I dont
Youre not interesting enough to be offensive
The Lannisters want Lady Sansa The Lannisters have money People kill for money I dont think we should be telling people were searching for Lady Sansa
My lady My lord Could I have a word
What about Not kidney pie
You seem like a proper lady Someone who could be trusted I never met no Sansa Stark But I know her sister Arya
No ones seen Arya Stark since her father was beheaded Shes presumed dead
She werent when I last spoke to her
When was that
Heading up north with the Nights Watch She was all dressed up as a boy Like your ladyship only without the armor Going by the name Arry
So what happened to her
Well
The quick version
The Lannisters took us prisoner We escaped The Brotherhood took us prisoner They sold me to the innkeep They were gonna sell Arya to her mother at Riverrun along with another prisoner Big ugly fellow Foul mouth and a face like a halfburnt ham Not friendly
The Hound
Thats the one If you find her could you give her this She liked the last one I gave her but well this one turned out better
Um you were saying
Her mothers dead grandfathers dead Walder Frey is the new lord of Riverrun The Brotherhood isnt going to Riverrun
Theyll take her to the Eyrie my lady
Why the Eyrie
Her aunt Lysa Arryn Catelyn Starks sister Shes Aryas last living relative with money She hates the Lannisters Lord Tyrion made sure I knew which house married which and who hated who
Sansa could be there too
Aye my lady Could be
You sure about this
No
I imagined youd be back at the brothel at this hour
I did spend some time with an absolutely stunning blonde the other day
Mm do tell Ive got every kind of filth down here except the kind I like
Your sister
Oh
Cersei approached me We spoke a great deal about her daughter How worried your sister is about her She was trying very hard to pretend she had not come to sway me against you I think she may have even believed it herself
Making honest feelings do dishonest work is one of her many gifts
It was difficult for her to hide her true intentions It is rare to meet a Lannister who shares my enthusiasm for dead Lannisters She desperately wants to see you killed
She didnt need to bother you It looks as though Ive taken care of that myself The joy she will feel when my head leaves my neck Shes wanted this for a long time
Yes I know We met you and I Many years ago
I think I would have remembered that
Unlikely You had just been born Our father brought me and my sister Elia with him on a visit to Casterly Rock My first time away from Dorne I didnt like anything about the Rock Not the food not the weather your accents Nothing But the biggest disappointment you
You and my family have more in common than you might admit
The whole way from Dorne all anyone talked about was the monster that had been born to Tywin Lannister A head twice the size of his body a tail between his legs claws one red eye the privates of both a girl and a boy
That would have made things so much easier
When we met your sister she promised she would show you to us Every day we would ask Every day she would say Soon Then she and your brother took us to your nursery and she unveiled the freak Your head was a bit large Your arms and legs were a bit small but no claw No red eye No tail between your legs Just a tiny pink cock We didnt try to hide our disappointment Thats not a monster I told Cersei Thats just a baby And she said He killed my mother And she pinched your little cock so hard I thought she might pull it off Until your brother made her stop It doesnt matter she told us Everyone says he will die soon I hope they are right He should not have lived this long
Well sooner or later Cersei always gets what she wants
And what about what I want Justice for my sister and her children
If you want justice youve come to the wrong place
I disagree
Ive come to the perfect place I want to bring those who have wronged me to justice And all those who have wronged me are right here I will begin with Ser Gregor Clegane who killed my sisters children and then raped her with their blood still on his hands before killing her too I will be your champion
Hello Robin
What are you doing
Im building my home Winterfell At least I think I am I havent been back there in a very long time
Why did you leave
Its a long story
I stay here in the Eyrie Mother says its dangerous on the roads and I have to keep myself safe because Im the Lord of the Vale and the Lord of the Vale is a very important person
Yes you certainly are
When will you go back
Probably never My family doesnt live there anymore and someone burned it down
Oh Does Winterfell have a Moon Door
No Im afraid not Its not high up in the mountains Its down on the ground
That sounds dangerous How do you make people fly
We dont
What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you dont like
I never did anything with them at all Girls didnt take part in that where I came from
Well Im Lord of the Vale When I grow up Ill be able to fly anybody who bothers me Or you When we get married you can tell me if you dont like somebody and then we can bring them back here and whoosh Right through the Moon Door
I like the sound of that
Lets put a Moon Door in your Winterfell
All right
It can go in here in this big tower
Careful Youve ruined it Now Im going to have to rebuild the whole thing
I didnt ruin it
You did
It was already ruined because it didnt have a Moon Door I was fixing it
Knocking things down isnt fixing them Its ruining them
I didnt ruin it
Youre being stupid
I didnt ruin it
Robin Im sorry I
Children
I hit him
Yes I saw
I shouldnt have done that
No his mother should have a long time ago Consider it a step in the right direction
If he tells Aunt Lysa
Let me worry about Aunt Lysa
I was trying to remember what everything looked like Ill never see it again
A lot can happen between now and never If you want to build a better home first you must demolish the old one
Why did you really kill Joffrey Tell me why
I loved your mother more than you could ever know Given the opportunity what do we do to those whove hurt the ones we love In a better world one where love could overcome strength and duty you might have been my child But we dont live in that world
Youre more beautiful than she ever was
Lord Baelish
Call me Petyr
You wanted to see me Aunt Lysa
Come here Sansa
Do you know how far the fall is
No
Neither do I precisely Hundreds of feet Its fascinating what happens to bodies when they hit the rocks from such a height The impact breaks them right apart Like eggs dropped on the floor Sometimes pieces remain intact Youll find the head sitting on its own Every hair in place Blue eyes staring at nothing I know what you did
Im so sorry Aunt Lysa I never should have hit Robin I know it I promise it wont happen
Dont be coy with me you little whore You kissed him You kissed Petyr
I didnt You dont understand
I saw you You cant lie to me because I saw it with my own eyes
He kissed me I pulled away
Liar Whore He is mine
Please
My father my husband my sister they all stood between us and now theyre all dead Thats what happens to people who stand between Petyr and me Look down Look down Look down Look down
Lysa Let her go
You want her This emptyheaded child
Let her go
Shes just like her mother Shell never love you I lied for you I killed for you Why did you bring her here Why
Ill send her away I swear on my life I swear to all the gods Let her go Lysa
Oh my sweet wife My sweet silly wife
Here we are
The Rains of Castamere
You fucking dick Same wrong guess every fucking time Listen ya cunt
Oh The Bear and the Maiden Fair
Theres a man with an ear Too bad youve got a hangnail for a cock First time I saw you with your britches down I thought you were a eunuch You seen it girls Like a baby snail peekin out of his shell  walks toward Gilly to Gilly baby was crying this morning It waked me up You hear me
Yes
Well what are you going to say
Im sorry it woke you up
I dont care if youre sorry Keep that baby quiet or I will
Dont you ever touch him
Hehehe little Wildling bitch You shouldve stayed with your own kind  hoots in the distance you listening to me
Shut your mouth
What Its just an owl you dumb bitch
No its not
I should never have left her there
You couldnt have known
Of course I couldve known They were raiding the villages close by
And we just cower in here while they slaughter our brothers
Our brothers had orders to stay at Castle Black
Oh so its alright then Black Jack and Kegs and Mully chopped to pieces cause they broke the rules
I didnt say it was alright Im sayin they shouldnt have been there
We pledged to guard the realms of men
Shes dead because of me
We cant even guard Moles Town
We cant go after them you know that Thats what they want
Little Same As if Id cut their throats myself
Maybe she managed to hide herself I thought one of you was dead you went North with Mormont and no one came back Not for ages But then you did
She survived Craster and he was the worst shit Ive ever met She survived the long march to the wall She survived a white walker for fucks sake She mightve got out
She might have
If they hit Moles Town then were next Mances army must be close
A hundred thousand
And theres what 5 of us left
If youre counting Black Jack Kegs and Mully A hundred and two
How do a hundred and two men stop a thousand
Whoever dies last be a good lad and burn the rest of us Once Im done with this world I dont want to come back
You think he was spying on you
No not spying
The Dothraki think outsiders are ridiculous taking shame in the naked body They make love under the stars for the whole Khalasar to see
Yes your grace
But you are not Dothraki
No
Well I dont see why it matters Grey worm isnt interested none of the unsullied care whats under our clothes
He was interested
What
I believe he was interested
When the slavers castrate the boys do they take all of it
All of it
The the pillar an the stones
I dont know your grace
Havent you ever wondered
Yes your grace
Missandei   I have come to apologize
You dont need to apologize
I hope I didnt frighten you
No
The lessons you give I in Common tongue these are precious to I
To me
To me
I dont remember teaching you the word precious
Jorah the Andal he teaches I he teaches me this word
Do you remember the name you were given at birth
I remember nothing Only unsullied
When they cut you do you remember that
Im sorry Im sorry they did that to you
Why Why sorry
Its a terrible thing to do to a boy
If the masters never cut me I am never unsullied I never stand in the Plaza of Pride when Daenerys Stormborn orders us to kill the masters I never am chosen to lead the unsullied I never meet Missandei from the Island of Naath I am sorry I for today I am sorry
Grey Worm
Im glad you saw me
So am I
Bracken Mmm strong As long as theyre in the see But when you take them out of the water no bones They collapse under their proud weight and slum into a heap of nothing Youd think theyd know that Unfortunately theyre not very bright What do you tell them
Im Theon Greyjoy son of Balon heir to the Iron Islands
And what are you really
Im Reek
Are you sure You do look very much like a lord Formidable proud
Im Reek
Until when
Always Forever
Thats right Until youre rotting in the ground Remember what you are and what youre not Bring me Lord Kenning
No closer Who are you
Im Kenning commander of this garrison And you say youre Theon Greyjoy
Yes
And why should I believe that
I was born on Pike to Balon Greyjoy His third and lastliving son I am your prince I swear it by the drowned god What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die
And if you were my prince why are you marching with a Bolton army
Lord Bolton took me captive after Winterfell He sent me to treat with you in good faith as your fellow Ironborn
And what does Lord Bolton want
You are fading from sickness You are badly outnumbered and youre hundreds of miles from the sea Lord Bolton implores you to protect your men and abandon this fortress you can no longer hold Do this and he will be just and fair with you as he is being with me The Boltons will give you safe passage to the stony shore
He wants us to surrender
My own father your king surrendered years ago to Robert Baratheon I watched him bend the knee There was no shame there He fought with honor as did you
shame fought with honor
Im sorry I didnt hear
No shame fought with honor Only a whipped dog would speak this way Or a woman Are you a woman boy
You dont know
The Ironborn will not surrender
Reek Reek
You go tell your master that Theon Greyjoy Or whoever the fuck you are What in the hell are you muttering
Reek
If we yield we live Is that what it says on this paper here
Yes Have your men raise the white flag and open the gates Youre going home
You didnt really think Id let them go did you Its falling out of fashion Fileting Sad but true Traditions are important Where are we without our history eh
Yes mlord Will we go home now
I believe we will To our new home
THE VALE You have foreign blood dont you Baelish
A greatgrandfather from Braavos yes I suppose all of our ancestors came from somewhere else originally
Our forebearers settled the Vale thousands of years ago Weve fought off invaders ever since
The beauty of the Vale is matched only by the nobility of its great families Lady Arryn often told me that you were her rock Lord Royce
She told me nothing about you Baelish But I didnt need to hear from her Moneylender Whoremonger Youve been licking Tywin Lannisters boots so long its a wonder your tongues not black
My lord
And when Jon Arryn named you Master of Coin no one cared Always been a grubby job Why not let a grubby man do it But when I heard you were lurking here fawning over the Lady Arryn
Lady Arryn invited me She and I have been close since childhood
Yes we all know how close you were Lady Arryns predilections were her own affair Her death is our affair
Of course Her suicide shattered us all
She was an odd fish Everyone knew that But suicide She adored that boy of hers I dont see her abandoning him Not by choice
Strange that within days of your arrival youve married Lady Arryn and shes fallen through the Moon Door
She was always prone to melancholy My lady wasnt meant for a world as brutal as ours
We were told there was a witness A girl
A niece of yours I believe
A girl with no learning and scattered wits I assure you she would be of no help
Wed like to speak with her
Let me fetch her
No need We prefer to hear her testimony unadulterated
Come closer child You have nothing to fear from us or him Lord Baelish here is your uncle Your name is Alayne Perhaps you would feel more comfortable if Lord Baelish left the room
My lady
I wasnt asking you
He can stay
Speak up girl youre not a damn kitchen mouse Tell us what you saw
Im sorry Lord Baelish I have to tell the truth  council tell you everything
Please Alayne leave nothing out
My name is not Alayne Its Sansa Stark eldest daughter of Lord Eddard Stark Lord Royce we met when you came to Winterfell You were escorting your son Ser Waymar to the Wall
Sansa Stark You tell lies right to my face you little worm
Lord Baelish has told many lies All to protect me Since my father was executed I have been a hostage in Kings Landing A plaything for Joffrey to torture or Queen Cersei to torment They beat me they humiliated me they married me to the Imp I had no friends in Kings Landing except one He saved me Smuggled me away when he had the chance He knew Id be safe here in the Eyrie with my own blood my Aunt Lysa The Lannisters have friends everywhere Even the Vale He made me swear not to tell anyone my true name
Your secret is safe with us my lady
Your father grew up right here in these halls We hunted together many times He was a fine man
Tell us what happened to your aunt Sansa
You knew her well my lords my lady You knew she was a troubled woman She always loved Lord Baelish She told me herself From the moment he arrived at the gates of Riverrun a boy of eight carrying everything he owned in a little sack She confessed to me she never loved Lord Arryn She did as her father commanded as so many of us have When the gods finally allowed her to be with Lord Baelish she was so happy For a time My aunt was a jealous lady She was terrified that Lord Baelish didnt love her anymore That he would abandon her for a younger woman And then one day she saw him kiss me
Lady Sansa
It was a peck on the cheek Lord Royce nothing more Lord Baelish is my uncle now in truth by marriage Hes always been so kind to me I was so happy to be here to be free All because of him But my aunt turned on me She cursed me Called me a whore Promised to throw me through the Moon Door When Lord Baelish tried to calm her she struck him She said she didnt want to live anymore She stood on the edge of that Moon Door He tried to reason with her Promised her she was the only one he had ever loved but she stepped through those doors and she was
Shh Shh its not your fault sweet girl Its not your fault
You could see it in the way she raised that boy Feeding him from her own teats when he was 10 years old
Lord Royce This is hardly the time
Apologies my lady And to you as well Baelish We treated you a bit harshly
You want justice Lord Royce I can hardly complain about that I want the same
Not much justice to be meted out in suicide is there
For Lysa no But for her son Only 20 years ago the knights of the Vale rode behind Jon Arryn Ned Stark Robert Baratheon They fought together to overcome the Mad King And since then Arryn and Royce Corbray Waynwood all the great houses of the Vale watched from the corner A timid boy at a tavern brawl
Are you questioning our courage
I want to know which side youre on Do you support the Lannisters the house that executed your friend Ned Stark
Of course we dont support the damn Lannisters
No Catelyn Stark begged her sister for support and Lysa refused By staying out of the fray youve allowed Tywin Lannister to destroy his rivals on every compass point Who stands against him now
Who would you have us back Lord Baelish Robb Stark is dead
Id have you back Robin Arryn Lord of the Vale
Robin Arryn is a sickly little boy
And sickly little boys sometimes become powerful men
More often they die young
I adored Lysa with all my heart But she loved her son so much she became overprotective He needs to learn how to swing a sword How to ride a horse
Aye its time
Yes its time Time for him to tour the Vale to visit all the castles in his domain Time for Robin to leave the nest
Ser Barristan
Yes Who sent you
Ser Barristan
Ser Jorah
Have I forgotten a council meeting
No
Whats this
A royal pardon signed by Robert Baratheon You spied on her
Who gave you this
Does it matter
Have you told her
I wanted to tell you first mantoman rather than go behind your back
Let me speak with her in private
Youll never be alone with her again
Why did the usurper pardon you
If we could speak alone
No speak to me here Explain it to me
Who do you think sent this to Meereen Who profits This is the work of Tywin Lannister He wants to divide us If were fighting each other were not fighting him
The pardon was signed the year we met Why were you pardoned Unless youre saying this document was forged
It is not forged
Why then
I sent letters to Varys the spymaster of Kings Landing
What was the content of these letters
Information
What information
When you and Viserys arrived in Pentos His plan to marry you to Khal Drogo When you were married When your brother died
You told him I was carrying Drogos child
I
Yes or no
Khaleesi
Dont call me that Did you tell him I was carrying Drogos child
Yes
That wine merchant tried to poison me because of your information
I stopped you from drinking his wine
Because you knew it was poisoned
I suspected
You betrayed me from the first
Forgive me I never meant please Khaleesi forgive me
You sold my secrets to the man who killed my father and stole my brothers throne
I have protected you Fought for you Killed for you
and you want me to forgive you
I have loved you
Love Love How can you say that to me Any other man and I would have you executed But you I do not want you in my city dead or alive Go back to your masters in Kings Landing Collect your pardon if you can
Daenerys please
Dont ever presume to touch me again or speak my name You have until dusk to collect your things and leave this city If youre found in Meereen past break of day Ill have your head thrown into Slavers Bay Go Now
Moat Cailin is yours Father
Walk with me Has there been any word from Locke
No
Unimportant A cripple a young boy None of the northern lords have seen them Dead most likely Most of the Ironborn have fled the North Now more will follow thanks to you Tell me what you see
Moors fields hills
Tell me what you see
Nothing
Not nothing The North Ride 700 miles that way youre still in the North 400 miles that way 300 miles that way The North is larger than the other six kingdoms combined And I am the Warden of the North The North is mine Now tell me what is your name
Ramsay Snow
No not Ramsay Snow  a scroll it From this day until your last day you are Ramsay Bolton son of Roose Bolton Warden of the North
You honor me I swear I will uphold your name and your tradition I will be worthy of you Father I promise
Come Reek Ill be needing a bath
THE VALE
Yes
First time I saw you you were just a child A girl from the North come to the capital for the first time Not a child any longer Why did you help me
They would have thrown you through the Moon Door if they found you guilty
Thats not an answer
If theyd have executed you what would they have done with me
I dont know
Neither do I
Better to gamble on the man you know than the strangers you dont And you think you know me
I know what you want
Do you
OUTSIDE THE VALE
I thought itd make me happy but it doesnt Not really Nothing makes you happy
Lots of things make me happy
Like what
Killing Polliver killing Rorge
So youre sad because you didnt get to kill Joffrey yourself Is that it
At least I could have been there to watch I wanted to see the look in his eyes when he knew it was over
Aye nothing in the world beats that look
You protected him for most of his life You think you could have saved him
I wasnt the damn wine taster Little shit deserved to die but poison poisons a womans weapon Men kill with steel
Thats your stupid pride talking Its why youll never be a great killer Id have killed Joffrey with a chicken bone if I had to
Id pay good money to see that  rubs his neck
You should have let me burn it
Its a fleabite
That fleabites got you walking a lot slower than you used to
Well we wont have to walk too much further
You really think my aunt will pay for me
Aye shell pay
Ive never even met her
Doesnt matter Youre her blood Family honor all that horseshit Its all you lords and ladies ever talk about
Im not a lady
Who would pass the Bloody Gate
The bloody Hound Sandor Clegane And his traveling companion Arya Stark niece of your lady Lysa Arryn
Then I offer my condolences Lady Arryn died Three days ago
THE VALE
Ive never left home before Uncle Petyr Im afraid to leave
You shouldnt be
The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie Mother said She said its not safe outside
It wasnt safe for her inside People die at their dinner tables They die in their beds They die squatting over their chamber pots Everybody dies sooner or later Dont worry about your death Worry about your life Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts That is what it means to be Lord of the Vale
Shall we go
Wine always helps I thank you for it Trial by combat Deciding a mans guilt or innocence in the eyes of the gods by having two other men hack each other to pieces Tells you something about the gods How much longer
Soon
Do you think Oberyn has a chance The Red Viper of Dorne You dont get a name like that unless youre deadly right
Ive never seen him fight
Oh hes going to die Im going to die
Oberyn believes in himself
Thats putting it mildly Whats the punishment for regicide Drawing and quartering Hanging Breaking at the wheel
Beheading
Seems rather ordinary And he was my nephew as well so what is that Fratricide is brothers Filicide is sons Nepoticide Thats the one Matricide patricide infanticide suicide Theres no kind of killing that doesnt have its own word
Cousins
Cousins youre right There is no word for cousin killing Well done Do you remember cousin Orson Orson Lannister
Of course Wetnurse dropped him on his head Left him simple
Simple Used to sit all day in the garden Crushing beetles with a rock
Khuu Khuu Khuu
Nothing made him happier
Nothing made you happier Youd think being tormented from birth would have given you some affinity for the afflicted
On the contrary Laughing at another persons misery was the only thing that made me feel like everyone else
The joke wore thin though
For you You drifted away
I had other interests
Yes other interests But I stayed with Orson
Why
I was curious Why was he smashing all those beetles What did he get out of it First thing I did was ask him Orson why are you smashing all those beetles He gave me an answer Smash the beetles Smash em Khuu Khuu Khuu I wasnt deterred I was the smartest person I knew Certainly I had the wherewithal to unravel the mysteries that lay at the heart of a moron So I went to Maester Volariks library
Volarik Tried to touch me once
Turns out far too much has been written about great men and not nearly enough about morons Doesnt seem right In any case I found nothing that illuminated the nature of Orsons affliction or the reason behind his relentless beetle slaughter So I went back to the source I may not have been able to speak with Orson but I could observe him watch him the way men watch animals to come to a deeper understanding of their behavior  a beetle as I watched I became more and more sure of it There was something happening there His face was like the page of a book written in a language I didnt understand But he wasnt mindless He had his reasons And I became possessed with knowing what they were I began to spend inordinate amounts of time watching him I would eat my lunch in the garden chewing my mutton to the music of khuu khuu khuu And when I wasnt watching him I was thinking about him Father droned on about the family legacy and I thought about Orsons beetles I read the histories of Targaryen conquests Did I hear dragon wings No I heard khuu khuu khuu and I still couldnt figure out why he was doing it And I had to know because it was horrible that all these beetles should be dying for no reason
Every day around the world men women and children are murdered by the score Who gives a dusty fuck about a bunch of beetles
I know I know But still it filled me with dread Piles and piles of them years and years of them How many countless living crawling things smashed and dried out and returned to the dirt In my dreams I found myself standing on a beach made of beetle husks stretching as far as the eye could see I woke up crying weeping for their shattered little bodies I tried to stop Orson once
He was twice your size
He just pushed me aside with a khuu and kept on smashing Every day until that mule kicked him in the chest and killed him  beetle back on the ground what do you think Why did he do it What was it all about
I dont know
Good luck today
Looks like very light armor
I like to move around
You could at least wear a helmet You shouldnt drink before a fight
You learn this during your years in the fighting pits I always drink before a fight
It could get you killed It could get me killed
Today is not the day I die
Youre going to fight that
Im going to kill that
He is the biggest man Ive ever seen
Size does not matter when you are flat on your back
Thank the gods
In the sight of gods and men we gather to ascertain the guilt or innocence of this man Tyrion Lannister May the Mother grant them mercy May the Father give them such justice as they deserve And may the Warrior guide the hand of our champion
Dont leave me alone in this world
Never
Have they told you who I am
Some dead man
I am the brother of Elia Martell Do you know why I have come all the way to this stinking shitpile of a city For you
Im going to hear you confess before you die You raped my sister You murdered her You killed her children Say it now and we can make this quick
Say it You raped her You murdered her You killed her children
You raped her You murdered her You killed her children
You raped her You murdered her
You killed her children
Wait Are you dying No no no You cant die yet You havent confessed Say it Say her name Elia Martell You raped her You killed her children Elia Martell Who gave you the order Who gave you the order Say her name You raped her You murdered her You killed her children Say it Say her name Say it
Elia Martell I killed her children Then I raped her Then I smashed her head in like this
What was she like
She she had red hair
Oh How big were her feet
Well what do you want me to say
I want you to tell me what it was like to have someone To be with someone To love someone and have them love you back Were all gonna die a lot sooner than Id planned Youre the closest Ill ever get to know it
So you and Gilly never
No she just had a baby and she never offered
But if she had you wouldve Youd have broken your vows
The interesting thing is our vows never specifically forbid intimate relations with women
What
I shall take no wife yes thats in there theres no denying that I shall father no children its very specific But what our vows have to say about other activities is open to interpretation
I dont think Ser Alliser cares much for interpretation
Anyway theres nothing for him to interpret We didnt So whats it like
Its theres this person this whole other person And youre wrapped up in them and theyre wrapped up in you and you for a little for a little while youre more than just you youre well I dont know Im not a bleedin poet
No youre really not
And what did I get for it An arrow six inches from my heart
Therell be arrows for all of us soon I imagine
There will
Theyve already done the worst thing to me they could ever do
Go get some sleep Sam Ill take this watch
Did I ever tell you about her My Sheila
Yes
Oh that was a night to remember Of course Id had a good bit to drink   the fangs were sharp but she knew how to use them And she was nice and soft down below No she was no ordinary beast Manys the man who
I know you never fucked a bear You know you never fucked a bear Right now I dont wanna think about the bear you never fucked Right now all I want to think about is each one of these arrows finding its way into a Crows heart
We could be waiting here a while
Good The longer we wait the more arrows Ill have When they came up here to our land and put up a big wall and said it was theirs Then they started hunting us down But this time were the ones doing the hunting
Youve got a lot to say about killing Even more words than arrows
Back in those villages I killed just as many of them as you did More I reckon
Yes But none of those were your Crow lover
I probably killed him already
So youve said
And if not The only thing left of him is gonna be his funbits hanging around me neck
And more words Know what I think you do when you see him Serve him up a nice juicy slice of ginger minge
What you been thinkin about that ginger minge Wondering what it tastes like
Maybe I have
Jon Snow is mine   Anyone else tries to kill him Ill have an arrow for them   And not one of your bald friends is fast enough to stop me
And what is it that couldnt wait until morning Tarly
Maester Aemon How did you know
That it was you Who else but Samwell Tarly would be wasting candles to read in the middle of the night
Let me help you
Oh no need I know my way around this library better than any other place in Castle Black Thousands of books and no eyes to read them Old age is a wonderful source of ironies if nothing else But you didnt answer my question what are you reading
Maester Faull
Ah the Wildlings I can assure you that the closest Maester Faull ever got to a Wildling was this very library
But what he says about what they do its all true Its exactly what the survivors of their raids report
Yes Imagine the stories Wildlings tell about us Love is the death of duty I told that to your friend Jon Snow once He didnt listen and neither did you Thats why you abandoned your watch atop the wall to come here and read about the things that may have happened to the girl you love
I dont love her
Yes you do
No
Yes you do I heard it in your voice when you first brought her to me I remember how it sounds I was in love once
You were
You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once more or less like you
Im sorry Maester I didnt mean it like that
You know who I was before I came here What I couldve been if Id only said the word Of course you do I met many girls when I was Aemon Targaryen A future king always does Some of them were quite forward in their attempts to win my affections One of them succeeded I was very young
Who was she
Ah ha I could tell you everything about her Who she was How we met The color of her eyes and the shape of her nose I can see her right in front of me Shes more real than you are We could spend all night trading tales of lost love Nothing makes the past a sweeter place to visit than the prospect of imminent death Go to bed Tarly
Im sorry I cant open the gate for nobody Its orders
They killed everyone Everyone but me and my baby And theyre out there I saw them on the way here they may have seen me they may have followed me please
Im sorry I cant
If they find the boy you dont know what theyll do
Pyp Open the gate
I cant
Sam is that you
Yes
Thorne gave me strict orders to not open the gate
Oh Pyp Open the fucking gate
Ive never heard you curse before
Yes well best get used to it
Are you alright Shh youre alright Yeah of course you are my brave little fella
It was horrible
Im so so sorry I didnt know until I got back
Dont let them send me away Sam
Never
I know theres no women allowed
Anyone who tries to throw you out will be having words with me From now on wherever you go I go too
Get ready
Its time
Pick up the pace
There we go boys Thats one Theres two Come on lets get the next lot Thats the last of the oil Ser Alliser
A hundred thousand you say
Yes sir
You can say it if you like We shouldve sealed the tunnel while we had the chance like you suggested
It was a difficult decision either way Ser
Do you know what leadership means Lord Snow It means that the person in charge gets secondguessed by every clever little twat with a mouth But if he starts secondguessing himself thats the end For him For the clever little twats For everyone This is not the end Not for us Not if you lot do your duty for however long it takes to beat them back And then you get to go on hating me and I get to go on wishing your Wildling whore had finished the job
Youll be safe down here Ill check on you as soon as I can
Youre leaving me again
Im not leaving you
Youre going up there and were staying down here Thats leaving You said from now on wed stay together
I I didnt mean in the same room
What are you going to do out there
Help my brothers
How You going to fight the Free Folk when they come Theyll kill you In Molestown they killed everyone
I cant just hide here with you while theyre fighting out there
Why not You wont matter up there you will down here
Look I am a man of the Nights Watch Gilly I made a promise to defend The Wall and I have to keep it because thats what men do
Promise me you wont die
I promise you I wont die
Theres a lot more Wildlings on the other side of the wall than this side Weve got us some weapons and things This is the perfect place for us to be
Ive never thrown a spear before Ive never held a sword with a proper edge Theres no place for me to be Youre not afraid
Of course Im afraid theres a band of Wildlings coming to kill us
Well if youre afraid of a band of Wildlings how in seven hells did you manage to kill a White Walker
I didnt know I was going to kill it but I had to do something I didnt have any choice he was going to kill Gilly and take the baby If someone had asked me my name right then I wouldnt have known I wasnt Samwell Tarly anymore I wasnt a Steward in the Nights Watch or son of Randyll Tarly or any of that I was nothing at all And when youre nothing at all theres no more reason to be afraid
But youre afraid now
Yes well Im not nothing anymore
Most of their men are up top Didnt count more than twenty down there Leftovers Theyve got a little fat one and a little bony one manning the front
How high are the walls

We cant just let them attack the gate
The bars of those gates are four inches of cold rolled steel

Night gathers and now my watch begins It shall not end until my death I shall take no wife hold no lands father no children I shall wear no crowns All
And win no glory I shall live and die at my post I am the sword in the darkness I am the watcher on the walls I am the shield that guards the realms of men I pledge my life and honor to the Nights Watch for this night and all the nights to come
I dont want you out there
You cant protect me forever There wont be anywhere to hide if the castle falls
I need him more than I need you
We need you boy
Jon Snow
No shh dont talk
Do you remember that cave
We shouldve stayed in that cave
Well go back there
You know nothing Jon Snow
Drop the scythe boys
Hoister up
Theyve had enough for one night
Dont cheer too loud They still outnumber us a thousand to one
Tormund Its over let it end
This is how a man ends
Put him in chains Well question him later
I shouldve thrown you from the top of your wall boy
Aye you shouldve
Woah Its me Its me I promised you didnt I
We held them off
For one night
This is a great victory
Great victory Mance was testing our defenses He almost made it through And he has more giants he has more mammoths He has a thousand times as many men Theyll hit us again tonight Maybe we can hold them off for a day or two but we can never beat them
Where are you going
Im going to find Mance
To you cant do that No one gave you any orders
Whos left to give orders The Wildling army is only an army because of Mance He united a hundred warring tribes Without Mance they lose their leader They lose their purpose they go back to fighting each other scatter back to their home
Without Mance Youre going to kill him
Im going to try
Theyll never let you within a hundred yards of him And if you did even if you managed to kill him
Hell kill me If I dont go hell kill me anyway Theyll kill the rest of us too
He wont just kill ya Theyll boil you Theyll filet you Theyll make it last days
Youre right Its a bad plan Whats your plan
They held the gate Get some brothers down here to help you You need to burn the bodies Raise the outer gate then lower it again as soon as Im out
What are you doing
I promised Jeor Id never lose it again  the sword to Sam case I dont come back
Youre wearing a black cloak again
Ive been sent to negotiate with you
It appears my trusting nature got the better of me Its happened before I was hoping your loyalty was real when you pledged yourself to us Jon Snow truly I was
The Halfhand ordered me to join your army and bring back whatever information I could to Castle Black He made me kill him so youd trust me I was loyal to him and to my Nights Watch vows
All of your vows She wasnt enough to turn ya eh Were you enough to turn her
She put three arrows in me when I escaped
Did you see her again at Castle Black
Yes
And
Shes dead
Your doing
No
Well drink to her
Of all the ways Id kill you poison would be the last
Ygritte
Ygritte
Thats not wine
No its a proper Northern drink Jon Snow You did well Fought hard Killed some of our strongest men One of our giants went into your tunnel and never came out again Mag the Mighty
Hes dead He killed my friend Grenn
He was their king Last of a bloodline that stretches back before the First Men
Grenn came from a farm
Mag and Grenn
Grenn and Mag
Kullback could I trouble you for something to eat I dont imagine our guest has eaten anything in quite some time So Youre here to strike a bargain
Turn your army around and go home
You know I know youre low on arrows Youre low on oil Youre low on men How many are left 50
I told Tormund and Orell We have more than a thousand men
I showed you everything I had The whole army a hundred thousand strong and what did you do You fired on us with everything you had It wasnt much Soon as I saw that I sent four hundred men to climb the wall An unmanned stretch five miles west of here A lot of them will die climbing but most of them will be over by the end of the day This is me being honest with you Jon Snow which is more than youve ever done for me My people have bled enough Were not here to conquer were here to hide behind your wall just like you We need your tunnel Now we both know that winter is coming and if my people arent south of the wall when it comes in earnest well all end up worse than dead Wanna strike a bargain with me Heres a bargain You go back you open the gates to us and I swear to you that no one else will die Refuse and well kill every last man in Castle Black
Ah Oh thats why youre here I reckon you could do it before any of them could stop ya Theyd kill you of course theyd kill ya slow but ya knew that when you came in here Are you capable of that Jon Snow Killing a man in his own tent when hes just offered ya peace Is that what the Nights Watch is Is that what you are
You attacking us
No its like you said we dont have the men
Hold To me To me
Stand down I said my people have bled enough and I meant it
Youre the king beyond the wall
You know who I am
Never had the pleasure
This is Stannis Baratheon the one true king of the seven kingdoms
Were not in the seven kingdoms and youre not dressed for this weather
It is customary to kneel when surrendering to a king
We do not kneel
Ill have thousands of your men in chains by nightfall Ill have nowhere to put them and nothing to feed them Im not here to slaughter beat dogs Their fate depends on their king
All the same we do not kneel
Take these men away
What are men of the Nights Watch doing in a Wildling camp
I was sent to discuss terms with the king beyond the wall
Youre speaking to the one true king boy Youll address him as your grace
I know hes the king My father died for him My name is Jon Snow your grace Im Ned Starks son
Your father was an honorable man
He was your grace
What do you think hed have done with him
I was this mans prisoner once He couldve tortured me he couldve killed me but he spared my life I think my father wouldve taken him prisoner listened to what he had to say
Very well   Take him
Your grace If my fatherd seen the things that Ive seen hed also tell you to burn the dead before nightfall All of them
I would suggest milk of the poppy to ease his pain but he is completely insensate
Bloody Martells
The cause appears to be manticore venom
It is yes manticore
Ive read a good deal about it Its a horrible poison usually Mantari in origin Oh Yes yes Theres nothing to be done
Yes there is
May I ask what you think youre doing
Saving him
Your grace I wish it were otherwise but Ser Gregor is beyond saving Well well beyond This man is not even a Maester let alone Grand Maester
Thats for the best No Maester knows how to save him
That is exactly the sort of arrogance that had him expelled from the citadel your grace His curiosity was deemed dangerous and unnatural Rightly so in my opinion
Youre dismissed Grand Maester
Your grace This is my laboratory
Not anymore
You can save him
Difficult to say your grace but if my past work is any guide We stand a chance
Do everything you can Come to me with anything you need
Thank you your grace You should know the process may change him somewhat
Will it weaken him
Oh no
Very well then
Not another word Weve been over this the matters closed
Im opening it again
You are betrothed to Loras Tyrell Still betrothed to Loras Tyrell and you will marry Loras Tyrell as soon as Tommen marries Margaery
I will not
Jaime cannot marry or inherit lands Tyrions sentence will be carried out tomorrow You have on several occasions made great claims about your commitment to this familys future Your role in that future is more vital now than it ever was
I dont care I will stay in Kings Landing where I belong with my son the king
When you were nine years old I was called to the capital I decided to take your brother with me and not you You insisted that you would not be left at Casterly Rock under any circumstances and if you recall
Im not interested in hearing another one of your smug stories about the time you won This isnt going to be one of those times
Do you think youll be the first person dragged into a sept to be married against her will
When you marched into the throne room to tell me wed won the Battle at Blackwater do you remember I was sitting on the iron throne with Tommen I was about to give him essence of nightshade thats how far I was willing to go when I thought someone awful had come to take my son away Someone awful is coming to take him away
No
Joffrey is dead Myrcellas been sold like livestock And now you want to ship me off to Highgarden and steal my boy my last boy Margaery will dig her claws in and you will dig your claws in and you will fight over him like beasts until you rip him apart I will burn our house to the ground before I let that happen
And how will you do that
Ill tell everyone the truth
And what truth would that be
You dont know do you You never believed it How is that possible What am I saying of course its possible How can someone so consumed by the idea of his family have any conception what his actual family was doing We were right there in front of you and you didnt see us One look in the past twenty years one real look and you wouldve known
Known what
Everything they say is true About Jaime and me
No no no no no
Your legacy is a lie
I dont believe you
Yes you do
Jaime
You won One fewer brother Must be proud of yourself Theres really nothing you wouldnt do is there
For my family no I would do things for my family you couldnt imagine
Tyrion is your family
Hes not
You dont get to choose
I do so do you You can choose the creature that killed our mother to come into this world
Are you really mad enough to blame him for that He didnt decide to kill her He was an infant
A disease doesnt decide to kill you all the same you cut it out before it does What do you decide What do you choose
The things I did to get back to you to endure all that only to find you
I choose you
Those are words
Yes Like the ones I just said to father I told him
Told him what
I told him about us
You told him
I told him I wouldnt marry Loras Tyrell I told him Im staying right here with Tommen with you
You think hell just accept that
Go and ask him
What did you say
I dont want to talk about Tywin Lannister I dont choose Tywin Lannister I dont love Tywin Lannister I love my brother I love my lover People will whisper theyll make their jokes Let them Theyre all so small I cant even see them I only see what matters
Someone will walk in
I dont care
You stand before Daenerys Stormborn the Unburnt Queen of Mereen Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar and the First Men Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
Thank you for seeing me your grace My name is Fennesz I can speak the common tongue if you wish
You speak it very well
Before you freed me I belonged to Master Mighdal I was tutor to his children I taught them languages and history They know a great deal about your family because of me Little Calla is only seven but she admires you very much
I hope I can prove worthy of her admiration What can I do for you
When you took the city the children begged me not to leave the house But Master Mighdal and I agreed that I must So I lost my home Now I live on the streets
I have outfitted mess halls to feed all former slaves and barracks to shelter them
I do not mean to offend your grace I went to one of these places The young prey on the old Take what they want and beat us if we resist
My Unsullied will make them safe again in short order my friend this I promise you
Even if they are safe who would I be there What purpose would I serve With my master I was a teacher I had the respect and love of these children
What is it that you want from me
Your grace I ask you to let me sell myself back to Master Mighdal
You want to return to a man who owned you like a goat or a chair
Please your grace the young may rejoice in the new world youve built for them But for those of us too old to change there is only fear and squalor I am not alone There are many outside waiting to beg the same
I did not take this city to preside over the injustice I fought to destroy I took it to bring people freedom But freedom means making your own choices I will allow you to sign a contract with your former master It may not cover a period lasting longer than a year
Thank you your grace Thank you
The masters will take advantage of this situation The men serving them will be slaves in all but name
Approach my friend
Valyrian do not understand my queen I do not understand my queen
Valyrian Queen says you may approach
 speaking Low Valyrian
I have brought you He came from the sky The black one The winged shadow He came from the sky and
My girl My little girl
What was her name
Zala your grace
How old was she
Three
Three   And still no word on Drogon
Sailors saw him flying over the Black Cliffs three days ago my queen Nothing since then
Meet me in the catacombs
They came to us from White Harbor and Barrowton from Fairmarket and Kings Landing from north and south from east and west They died protecting men women and children who will never know their names It is for us to remember them Our brothers we shall never see their like again
And now their watch is ended
And now their watch is endedAemon passes the torch around as each member of the Nights Watch helps burn the bodies Stannis watches from above
Your old blind man patched me up Why
Hes sworn to treat all wounded men friend or foe
You want me alive so you can torture me
No ones going to torture you
So how do we die Hanging Beheading Drop us from the top of the wall
I dont know what happens to the prisoners
Who decides
I suppose Stannis does
He your king now
I dont have a king
You spent too much time with us Jon Snow You can never be a kneeler again
Were gonna burn the bodies of your dead Do you want to say any words over them
Words What kind of words
Funeral words I dont know how the Free Folk do it
Do what
Say farewell
The dead cant hear us boy
Snow Did you love her She loved you
She told you
No All she ever talked about was killing you Thats how I know She belongs in the North The real North You understand me

The First Men called us The Children but we were born long before them Come he waits for you
Youre the threeeyed raven
I have been many things Now I am what you see
My brother he led us to you and now he
He knew what would happen From the moment he left he knew and he went anyway
How do you know
Ive been watching you All of you all of your lives with a thousand eyes and one Now youve come to me at last Brandon Stark though the hour is late
I didnt want anyone to die for me
He died so that you could find what you have lost
Youre going to help me walk again
Youll never walk again But you will fly
Podrick Podrick Where are the horses

I suppose this is goodbye then
Farewell little brother
Jaime thank you For my life
Quickly now
Tywin my lion
Im sorry Im sorry
Tyrion Put down the crossbow Who released you Ah your brother I expect He always had a soft spot for you Come well go and talk in my chambers Is this how you want to speak to me Shaming your father has always given you pleasure
All my life youve wanted me dead
Yes But you refused to die I respect that even admire it You fight for whats yours Id never let them execute you is that what you fear Id never let Illyn Payne take your head Youre a Lannister Youre my son
I loved her
Who
Shae
Bah Tyrion Put down that crossbow
I murdered her With my own hands
It doesnt matter
It doesnt matter
She was a whore
Say that word again
And what Youll kill your own father in the privy No Youre my son Enough of this nonsense
I am your son and you sentenced me to die You knew I didnt poison Joffrey but you sentenced me all the same Why
Enough Well go back to my chambers and speak with some dignity
I cant go back there Shes in there
What are you afraid of a dead whore
You shot me Youre no son of mine
I am your son I have always been your son
What have you done Quickly Trust me my friend Ive brought you this far
I want to see the captain
Youre seeing him
I want to go north to the wall
No you dont
I can pay
There is nothing in the north but ice and war and pirates
I wouldnt need a cabin Please I could work scrubbing the floors or
Im not going north child were going home
Wheres home
The Free City of Braavos
Wait I have something else
More silver wont make a difference
Its not silver its iron
Valar morghulis
We shouldnt be out here alone
Why not
If your father hears
Hell never know weve been gone
But if he finds out
You dont need to be afraid of my father
Are you sure
Yes
We shouldnt go in
Of course we should
Get out Get out
Lets go
No
Listen to your friend
They said that you were terrifying With cats teeth and three eyes Youre not terrifying Youre boring
You dont know what I am
I know youre a witch and you can see the future Tell me mine
Everybody wants to know their future Until they know their future
This is my fathers land My land Tell me my future or Ill have your two boring eyes gouged out of your head
Your blood Give me a taste
Three questions you get You wont like the answers
Ive been promised to the prince When will we marry
Youll never wed the prince Youll wed the king
But I will be queen
Oh yes youll be queen For a time In comes another Younger more beautiful to cast you down and take all you hold dear
Will the king and I have children
No The king will have 20 children and you will have 3
That doesnt make sense
Gold will be their crowns Gold their shrouds
Come on we have to go We have to go Cersei
Your grace we are honored by your presence The mourners are waiting
They will keep waiting I want a moment alone with him
But your grace many of these lords and ladies have travelled day and night to be here
From all seven kingdoms
They will wait
He never wanted you to be a Kings Guard but here you are protecting his dead body
What he built The towers He built it for us He meant it for us Theyre going to try to take it away all of it
They
All of them out there are enemies Theyre waiting a night to make sure hes really dead and as soon as they see the stones on his eyes theyll set to work on tearing us apart
They had nothing to do with it The man who murdered our father he tore us apart hes the enemy Ive been telling you for years youve been defending him for years
This is exactly what they want
and now our father is dead And that little monster is out there somewhere drawing breath Did you set him free
Tyrion may be a monster but at least he killed our father on purpose You killed him by mistake With stupidity Youre a man of action arent you When it occurs to you to do something you do it nevermind the consequences Take a look Look at the consequences Here they are He loved you more than anyone in this world
Apologies
I still dont see why I had to stay in this fucking crate once we set sail
I saved your life If they catch you they catch me I cannot say I feel overly guilty about leaving you in that fucking crate
Do you know what its like to stuff your shit through one of those air holes
No I only know what its like to pick up your shit and throw it overboard
Pentos
The home of my colleague Ilyrio Mopatis A merchant He and I met many years ago through mutual friends A group of people who saw Robert Baratheon for the disaster he was We tried to do what was best for the realm by supporting the Targaryen restoration And thus began the chain of mistakes that has led us both here Things have gotten worse not better Westeros needs to be saved from itself
Much better
My lord
I dont think I am anymore A lord Are you a lord if you kill your father I dont suppose they revoke your nobility for killing a whore That has to be happen all the time
You already drank yourself across the Narrow Sea
In a box Why stop now
Because we are talking about the future of our country
The future is shit Just like the past
You want the same Same as always
You you dont have to
Habit
Sons of the Harpy
Yes your grace They left it on the body
Theyve never killed before
It was only a matter of time your grace Conquerors are always met with resistance
I didnt conquer them Their own people did
They do not see us as people Your Grace
Then they will have to learn to see things differently Mossador He did not risk his life fighting for freedom so cowards in masks could take it away And I did not take up residence in this pyramid so I could watch the city below decline into chaos What was the name of the man you lost
White Rat your grace
I want him buried with honor Publicly In the Temple of the Graces
The Sons of the Harpy will hear that message
Make them very angry
Angry snakes lash out Makes chopping off their heads that much easier Find the men who did this and bring them to me
Torgo Nudho
Missandei hin Naath
I wanted to speak with you
Why do you come
White Rat the Unsullied who I have heard they found his body in a brothel I have heard that more than one Unsullied has been known to visit Meereens brothels May I ask you why Why would an Unsullied go to a brothel
I do not know I must go
Get your shield up
Its too heavy
If it wasnt heavy it wouldnt stop a sword now get it up
Come Try it again Drive at me Keep your shield up Or Ill ring your head like a bell
Shouldnt you be training too
Well Im hardly a new recruit How many brothers can say theyve killed a white walker and a Thenn I might be the first in history
These men need a firm hand Always have Theyre poachers and thieves
Not soldiers
That one hates me
If Ser Alliser is chosen as the new Lord Commander he hates the wildlings
All the wildlings
Dont let them send us away
Its not a sure thing Ser Denys Mallister has commanded the Shadow Tower for 20 years and people say hes a good man Hes running against Ser Alliser
Sam Dont let them send us away
I told you Wherever you go I go too
You cant leave theyll execute you
Good good pivot Dont forget to pivot Shield up
The king wants a word
Youre not cold my lady
Never The Lords fire lives within me Jon Snow
Feel
Are you a virgin
No
Good
Your grace The bastard of Winterfell
You know who rules at Winterfell now
Roose Bolton
The traitor who plunged a dagger into Robb Starks heart Dont you want to avenge him
I want a great many things your grace But Im a sworn brother of the Nights Watch now
Ive been talking to your sworn brothers Many of them love you
Theyre good men
Many dont You were seen taking the body of a wildling girl north of the Wall Why
Its where she belonged
Some of the Nights Watch feel you have too much affection for the wildlings
They were born on the wrong side of the wall That doesnt make them monsters
No matter I shall take back the North from the thieves who stole it Tywin Lannister is dead He cant protect them now I shall mount Roose Boltons head on a spike But if Im to take Winterfell Ill need more men
The men of the Nights Watch are sworn to play no part
Im not talking about the damn Nights Watch Im talking about the wildlings
Your grace you want the wildlings to march in your army
If they swear to follow me Ill pardon them Well take Winterfell Once the North is won Ill declare them citizens of the realm Ill give them land to live on
Its a fair offer More than fair
Ill offer them their lives and their freedom if Mance kneels before me and swears his loyalty
I dont think thats likely
You admire him dont you
I respect him
He likes you Convince him to bend the knee
Your grace
or he burns
How much time do I have
Nightfall The sun drops fast this time of year Hurry Jon Snow
Sword up Attack my lord Attack Dont cross your feet
My sons have had swords in their hands from the time they could walk This one
Lord Arryn will never be a great warrior
Great warrior He sings a sword like a girl with palsy
My lord
Sword up my lord
Some boys develop more slowly Hes still young
Hes 13 Boys go to war at 13
He has other gifts
Does he
The gift of a great name Sometimes thats all one needs
Goodbye Lord Royce and thank you for all youve done for me
I have done nothing more than my duty my lady
I have no doubt that upon my return Robins skills will have improved immeasurably
Hell be safe here As for his skills I make no promises
Will we head north at some point He said Sansa had a brother at Castle Black Were a few days ride from the Kingsroad but that will take us
Us The only reason youre here is that Jaime Lannister told me you werent safe in the capital Youre hundreds of miles from Kings Landing No one knows what you look like No one cares Youre safe
But Im youre squire
Do you even know what a squire is
An attendant to a knight
Im not a knight That means youre not a squire
Well where would I go
I dont care Im not your mother
You swore to find the Stark girls
I found Arya She didnt want my protection
Sansa still might
Will you shut your mouth I didnt ask for advice I dont want anyone following me Im not a leader All I ever wanted is to fight for a Lord I believed in The good lords are dead and the rest are monsters
You told Lord Royce we were going to the Fingers
I did
But were heading west
We are
If he wanted to betray us he already would have
Lord Royce may be as honorable as he thinks he is but hes not alone in that castle Do you trust all those knights and ladies stable boys and serving girls
No Do you trust the carriage driver or the knights escorting us
No But I pay them well and theyve seen what happens to men who disappoint me
So where are we going To a land where you trust everyone
So a land so far from here even Cersei Lannister cant get her hands on you
It was such a deep deep shock to us all Your father was a force to be reckoned with He truly was I wouldnt presume to claim to have known him as such
But just being in his presence was enough to make it so clear just how formidable a person you were dealing with What a what a force to be reckoned with
Thank you so much for your kind words
Deepest condolences your grace This tragedy I never trusted Varys I often warned
Your grace
Cousin Lancel I hardly recognized you
My deepest sympathies
I apologize for my sons appearance
Uncle its quite alright
They call themselves sparrows Bloody fanatics Religion has its place of course but at a certain point They never would have come to the capital when Tywin was alive
Im sure hell grow out of it Whatever it is Excuse me
Of course
Your wounds from the Blackwater seem to have healed
It wasnt my wounds that needed healing
What can I do for you
You can forgive me
What could you possibly have done to warrant my forgiveness
I led you into the darkness
I doubt youve ever led anyone anywhere
I tempted you into our unnatural relations And of course there was the king His boar hunt His wine
I dont know what youre talking about
Im a different person now I found peace in the light of the Seven You can too They watch over all of us ready to dole out mercy or justice Their world is at hand I will pray for your fathers soul
The day Tywin Lannisters soul needs your help
It looks like Dorne
No it doesnt
It does Thats the Sunspear bit right there And thats where the mountains are And over here is Sunsnake Stonespear
Sandstone
Yes Yes Sandstone Just there
Fine
Its Dorne
We should go there I think we would have a lovely time
Judging by my experience that would be wonderful Dorne Highgarden Anywhere but here
Were late for dinner as it is
Youre very respectful
Im very hungry
Whats your name
Olyvar my lady
Im afraid my brother is keeping the king waiting Olyvar
Perhaps you might consider being a bit more discreet
Why They all know about me anyway Everybody knows everything about everyone Whats the point in trying to keep a secret in a place like this
In any event you shouldnt keep your intended waiting
My intended Please Tywins dead That means no one can force Cersei to marry me
Lucky you
Unlucky you
You think I want that woman married to my brother
If she doesnt marry me she doesnt go to Highgarden Which means she stays in Kings Landing Which means youre trapped here with Cersei Lannister as your motherbylaw
Perhaps
Perhaps
Perhaps
Eunuch the spider the master of whisperers
Imp halfman
There are faster ways to kill yourself
Not for a coward
You are many things my friend but not a coward
You never told me why you set me free
Your brother asked me to
You could have said no
Refuse the Kingslayer A dangerous proposition
Not as dangerous as releasing me You risked your life your position everything Why Youre not family you owe me nothing
I didnt do it for you I did it for the Seven Kingdoms
A drunken dwarf will never be the savior of the Seven Kingdoms
I dont believe in saviors I believe men of talent have a role to play in the war to come
Youre going to have to find another soldier Im done with Westeros and Westeros is done with me
You have many admirable qualities selfpity is not one of them Any fool with a bit of luck can find himself born into power But earning it for yourself that takes work
Im not wellsuited for work
I think you are You have your fathers instinct for politics and you have compassion
Compassion Yes I killed my lover with my bare hands I shot my own father with a crossbow
I never said you were perfect
What is it you want exactly
Peace Prosperity A land where the powerful do not prey on the powerless
Where the castles are made of gingerbread and the moats are filled with blackberry wine The powerful have always preyed on the powerless thats how they became powerful in the first place
Perhaps And perhaps weve grown so used to horror we assume theres no other way If you sat on the Iron Throne would you spread misery throughout the land
I will never sit on the Iron Throne
No you wont But you could help another climb those steps and take that seat The Seven Kingdoms need someone stronger than Tommen but gentler than Stannis A monarch who can intimidate the high lord and inspire the people A ruler loved by millions with a powerful army and the right family name
Good luck finding him
Who said anything about him You have a choice my friend You can stay here at Ilyrios palace and drink yourself to death or you can ride with me to Mereen meet Daenerys Targaryen and decide if the world is worth fighting for
Can I drink myself to death on the road to Meereen
When did the Unsullied start patrolling the streets of Meereen Looks like your friends havent been behaving themselves
The mission to Yunkai was a resounding success The Wise Masters of Yunkai have agreed to cede power to a council of elders made up of both the freedmen and the former slaveholders All matters of consequence will be brought to you for review
Good
They did ask for some concessions
Concessions
Politics is the art of compromise your grace
Im not a politician Im a queen
Forgive me Youre right of course Still its easier to rule happy subjects than angry ones
I dont expect the Wise Masters to be happy Slavery made them rich I ended slavery
They do not ask for the return of slavery They ask for the reopening of the fighting pits
The fighting pits Where slaves fought slaves to the death
In the new world that youve brought to us free men would fight free men
The pitfighters that you liberated plead for this opportunity Bring some here and ask them yourself
No fighting pits
Opening them would show the people of Yunkai and Meereen that you respect their traditions
I do not respect the tradition of human cockfighting
If you
How many times must I say no before you understand
Whatever he wants from me hes not going to get it If he really believes Im going to reopen the fighting pits
You should reopen the fighting pits
What
My mother was a whore I told you that She liked to drink pear brandy The older she got the less she made selling her body the more she wanted to drink So one day when I was 12 she sold me to a slaver she fucked the night before
Why
I was a bad child I wasnt big but I was quick And I loved to fight So they sold me to a man in Tolos who trained fighters for the pits I had my first match when I was 16
You were sold into slavery forced to fight to the death for the amusement of the masters and youre defending the fighting pits
Im only here because of those pits I learned to fight like a Dothraki screamer a Norvoshi priest a Westerosi knight Soon I was famous 10000 men and women screamed my name when I stepped into the pit I made so much money for my master he set me free when I died I joined the Second Sons and then I met you
Youre the queen Everyones too afraid of you to speak truth Everyone but me Youve made thousands of enemies all across the world As soon as they see weakness theyll attack Show your strength here now
Thats why I have the Unsullied patrolling the streets
Anyone with a chest full of gold can buy an army of Unsullied Youre not the Mother of Unsullied Youre the Mother of Dragons
I dont want another childs bones dropped at my feet No ones seen Drogon in weeks For all I know hes flown halfway across the world I cant control them anymore
A dragon queen with no dragons is not a queen
Viserion Rhaegal
Easy Easy Easy
So here we are
Here we are
When we first met you were my prisoner And now for our last meeting
This doesnt have to be our last meeting
No but it will be
You know what Stannis wants
He wants me to bend the knee And he wants the free folk to fight for him Ill give him this much hes bold
Shouldnt a king be bold
Oh aye I respect him If he gets what he wants I expect hell be a better ruler than the fools sitting on the Iron Throne the last hundred years But Ill never serve him
You told me you werent here to conquer You told me your people have bled enough
Thats right But I dont want them bleeding for Stannis Baratheon either
You spent your life convincing 90 clans to come together for the first time in history Thenns and Hornfoots the iceriver clans even the giants A lifes work uniting them You didnt do it for power You didnt do it for glory You brought them together to save them because none of them will survive the winter not if theyre north of the wall Isnt their survival more important than your pride
Pride Fuck my pride This isnt about that
Then bend the knee and save your people
They followed me because they respected me Because they believed in me The moment I kneel for a Southern king thats all gone
And how many tens of thousands are out there right now How many women How many children And you wont go out and rescue them because why Youre afraid of looking afraid
Oh I am afraid No shame in that How will they do it Beheading Hanging
Theyll burn you alive
Bad way to go Ill be honest with you I dont want to die And burnt to death I dont want people to remember me like that Scorched and screaming But its better than betraying everything I believe
And what happens to your people You preserve your dignity and die standing and theyll sing songs about you Youd rather burn than kneel The great hero Until winter comes and the white walkers come for us all and theres no one left to sing
Youre a good lad Truly you are But if you cant understand why I wont enlist my people in a foreigners war theres no point explaining
I think youre making a terrible mistake
The freedom to make my own mistakes was all I ever wanted
Mance Rayder youve been called the King Beyond the Wall Westeros only has one king Bend the knee I promise you mercy
Kneel and live
This was my home for many years I wish you good fortune in the wars to come
Man or woman young or old lord or peasant our choices are the same We choose light or we choose darkness We choose good or we choose evil We choose the true god or the false
In the old times whenever Braavos stood in danger the titan would step with fire in his eyes Hed wade into the sea and smash the enemies
Hes just a statue
Dont be afraid Hes announcing our arrival
Im not afraid
The House of Black and White this is where youll find the man you seek
Here I leave you
Thank you for bringing me
Any man of Braavos would have done the same Valar morghulis
Valar dohaeris
Hello Valar Morghulis
Jaqen Hghar gave me this
No one here by that name
Please I crossed the Narrow Sea I have nowhere else to go
You have everywhere else to go
But wait
Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant Cersei Walder Frey The Mountain Meryn Trant
The Mountain Meryn Trant
Must be good food if its crowded
Ale Ale
Before we left a maester gave you a raven scroll
You are becoming an observant young lady
My mother used to say dark wings dark words
An old saying Inaccurate in this case
So it was good news
My marriage proposal has been accepted
I thought you still mourn the death of my beloved Aunt Lysa
Ale
Ill have some
My lady
What is it
Sansa Stark Dont look
You sure
Shes dyed her hair but its her Shes sitting with Petyr Baelish
Littlefinger
A bunch of knights with him BRIENNE Bunch Whats a bunch 100 6 20
10 I think Too many My lady I dont think this is the right
Ready the horses
We only have one horse
Find more
Do you like the taste
I dont see what all the fuss is about Why do men love it so much
It gives some men courage
Does it give you courage
Thats far enough
Lord Baelish Lady Sansa my name is Brienne of Tarth
Weve met With Renly Baratheon What did he say about you He said Youre a loyalty comes free of charge Someone appears to have paid quite a bit for it since then
Lady Sansa before your mothers death I was her sworn sword I gave my word I would find you and protect you I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new
Please Lady Brienne No need for such formality You are Catelyn Starks sworn sword
I was
Strange I knew Cat from the time we were children She never mentioned you
It was after Renlys murder
Ah yes You were accused of killing him
I tried to save him
But you were accused
By men who didnt see what happened
Then what did happen
He was murdered by a shadow A shadow with a face of Stannis Baratheon
A shadow With a face This woman swore to protect Renly she failed She swore to protect your mother she failed Why would I want somebody with your history of failure guiding Lady Sansa
Why should you have any say in her affairs
Because I am her uncle I married her Aunt Lysa shortly before my beloveds untimely death Were family now and youre an outsider Forgive me Lady Brienne but experiences made me wary of outsiders
Lady Sansa if we can have a word alone
No
Please my lady If I could explain
I saw you at Joffreys wedding bowing to the king
Neither of us wanted to be there Sometimes we dont have a choice
And sometimes we do You should leave
We dont want our new friend wandering the countryside alone The roads of these parts arent safe Why dont you stay
He asked you to stay
After her
Podrick
Stop stop stop Thats a good boy
I guess that means youre unarmed
Down Podrick down
Podrick
Yes my lady
You can stand now
Yes my lady Sansa Stark
Wary of strangers as she should me I saw her riding on the East Trail with Littlefinger Well follow them
My lady if those Stark girls refused your service maybe youre released from your vow
I swore to their mother Id protect those girls
If they dont want your protection
Do you think shes safe from Littlefinger
No my lady
Get your horse
A summons from the queen
There are only two like it in the world the one Im wearing and the one I gave to Myrcella
Its a threat
Of course its a threat Our daughters in Dorne surrounded by people who hate our family Its a threat
No note
They blame us for the death of Oberyn and his sister and every other tragedy thats befallen their cursed country I will burn their cities to the ground if they touch her
Softer
What
Not so loud
Our daughters in danger and youre worried Im speaking too loudly
The world cant know knows shes our daughter
Then dont call her your daughter Youve never been a father to her
If I was the father to any of my children theyd be stoned in the streets
And what has your caution brought Our eldest child murdered at his own wedding Our only daughter shipped off to Dorne Our baby boy sent to marry that smirking whore from Highgarden
Ill make things better
You never made anything better
Im going to Dorne Ill bring our daughter home
You cant just ask Prince Doran to give her back Shes promised his son
Im not going to ask him anything
You go there with an army its an act of war
No army Do you know where theyre keeping her
Oberyn mentioned the Water Gardens
Ill find her Is there anything else your grace
Youre going to Dorne A onehanded man Alone
I never said I was going alone
No sunflowers I dont like yellow Roses are very nice definitely roses And music I adore music But no flutes I hate flutes We can have a harp if you like but no flutes Then theres the food Food is the most important thing dont you agree Were going to need pigeon pies Thats what they eat in the capital dont they
Dont they
Dont who
People eat pigeon pie in the capital
They certainly do my dear They certainly do
Its a fine place isnt it A fine place I never thought Id end up settling down in a place like this
You wont
Pardon
We wont get to live at Stokeworth When Mother dies my sister gets the castle because shes older
Oh
She hates me She calls me mean names and sometimes even still she pulls my hair when Mother isnt looking
You know what I think I think youre a good person And your sister is a mean person
She is
Ive been all over the world And if theres one thing Ive learned its that meanness comes around People like your sister they always get whats coming to them eventually One way or another
Whos that
Jaime fucking Lannister
Ser Jaime
Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
I was very sorry to hear about your father
Thank you
This is my betrothed Lollys
A pleasure
Run along love
Beautiful bride youve chosen When were you planning on getting married
Just get on with it
On with what
What youre here for Theres no way this little visit could possibly mean anything good for me
Its very good for you
Lollys will be marrying Ser Wyllis Bracken
Mmm
We made a deal your sister and I
I would have advised against that
How is this good for me
Cause youre going to come with me and help me with something important And when we return Im going to give you a much better girl and a much better castle
Return from where
As far south as south goes
My future queen
The prince does not wish to be disturbed
Remove myself from my path or Ill take that long axe and shove it
Captain Let her pass
Your brother was murdered and you sit here at the Water Gardens staring at the sky and doing nothing
Oberyn was slain during a trial by combat By law that is not murder
Your brother
You dont have to remind me He was my brother long before he was anything to you
What will you do about his death
I will bury him I will mourn for him
You would have me go to war
You would have me go to war
The whole country would have you go to war
Then we are lucky the whole country does not decide
The Sand Snakes are with me They have the love of their people They will avenge your father while you sit here in your chair doing nothing
Oberyn is dead And this Lannister girl skips about the Water Gardens eating our food breathing our air How many of your brothers and sisters do they have to kill Let me have her Let me send her to Cersei one finger at a time
I loved my brother And you made him very happy For that you will always have a place in my heart But we do not mutilate little girls for vengeance Not here Not while I rule
And how long will that be
The Unsullied are too conspicuous
Anyone can see you coming from a mile off Of course you havent found any Sons of the Harpy You havent have you
My Second Sons on the other hand they drink they whore fight in the streets they blend in They overhear things in taverns follow people from the taverns to nice quiet alleys break a few fingers overhear a few more things Before you know it
No one here We go
In a hurry Youre afraid
Unsullied fear nothing
Right Thats your problem You understood fear once long ago but youve forgotten what it means Someone whos forgotten fear has forgotten how to hide
Fear is useful that way
Sons of the Harpy they want to put a collar back on my neck On all of our necks Please Your Grace you must kill him
It would send a message
I think you should exercise restraint Your Grace
Why
For one thing he may have valuable information
The Son of the Harpy has no more valuable information
How do you know that
Because I questioned him
And the information you did get he is young and poor
He is born free
Why should he want to bring back slavery What did it do for him
Perhaps the only thing that gave him pride was knowing that there was someone lower than he was
They pay him Great families afraid to do a thing They pay poor man to do it for them
And how do you know this
Everyone knows this
I dont know it and Im the head of a great family
We do not know what this man did or didnt do Give him a trial at least A fair trial Show all of the citizens of Meereen that you are better than those who would depose Teach them a better way
I do not know the place from where Old Ser comes Things maybe are different there I hope But here in Meereen before Daenerys Stormborn they own us So we learn much about them or we do not live long They teach me what they are Mercy
these mean nothing to them All they understand is blood
Thank you all for your counsel
Your Grace a word please I beg you
About what
About your father About the Mad King
The Mad King Youre here to remind me of my enemies lies Consider me reminded
Your Grace I served in his Kingsguard I was at his side from the first Your enemies did not lie
Go on
When the people rose in revolt against him your father set their towns and castles aflame He murdered sons in front of their fathers He burned men alive with Wildfire and laughed as they screamed And his efforts to stamp out dissent led to rebellion that killed every Targaryen except two
Im not my father
No Your Grace Thank the gods But the Mad King gave his enemies the justice he thought they deserved And each time it made him feel powerful and right Until the very end
I will not have the Son of the Harpy executed without a fair trial
Your Grace
Theres a bug
Yes best be careful You might accidentally consume some solid food
When I agreed to come with you did I misrepresent my intentions Besides what is there for me to do inside this fucking box
You dont like it
I want to take a walk
You cant Cersei has offered a lordship to the man who brings her your head
She ought to offer her cunt Best part of her for the best part of me Well I suppose a box is as good a place for me as anywhere
Are we really going to spend the entire road to Volantis talking about the futility of everything
Youre right No point The road to Volantis You said we were going to Meereen Whats in Volantis
The road to Meereen
And what do you hope to find at the end of the road to Meereen
I told you A ruler
Weve already got a ruler Everywhere has already got a ruler Every pile of shit on the side of every road has someones banner hanging from it
You were quite good you know At ruling During your brief tenure as Hand
I didnt rule I was a servant
Still a man of talent
Managed to kill a lot of people
Yes but showed great promise in other areas as well
She wanted me to leave Kings Landing She begged me I wouldnt go
Why
Cause I liked it Power Even as a servant
People follow leaders And they will never follow us They find us repulsive
I find us repulsive
And we find them repulsive which is why we surround ourselves with large comfortable boxes to keep them away And yet no matter what we do people like you and me are never really satisfied inside the box Not for long
Youre right Lets go for a walk
No
How many dwarves are there in the world Is Cersei going to kill them all
Not him
Are you trying to deceive your Queen Shall I throw them in a cell Your Grace
That wont be necessary I dont want to dissuade the other hunters Mistakes will be made
Thank you Your Grace Thank you
Take the head
Pardon me Your Grace I would take it if you dont mind It could prove useful for my work
Very good
Over there will be fine
You heard the man Over there
Youre the Hand of the King
No Uncle Clearly it would not be appropriate for a woman to assume that role Im merely advising my son until he comes of age and chooses a Hand for himself
Your Grace I would be willing to serve provisionally as the Kings Hand until he becomes old enough
Youre a good man Lord Tyrell but I dont imagine youll have the time In addition to being Master of Ships the king has appointed you Master of Coin
Oh Your Grace
He called your experience and wisdom in financial matters unparalleled He said he would be honored to have you represent the crowns interests in the same
The honor is all mine Your Grace
Your Grace in the past on several occasions a Grand Maester has served as the Kings Hand
ing has named Qyburn the new Master of Whisperers
Your Grace him This man This embarrassment to the Citadel Your Grace what qualifications can he possibly have for this post
The qualification of loyalty Grand Maester Thats far more than the eunuch ever had Far more than many ever have
I must say I cannot see
Uncle Kevan in light of your position as commander of the Lannister armies it would please the king if you would serve as his Master of War No man living better deserves the title
That is kind of you to say I would like to hear it from the king himself
The king is very busy at this moment
He should be here learning what it means to rule
He is learning On this occasion in his capacity as ruler hes asked me to speak on his behalf
I returned to the capital to pay my respects to my brother And to you And to serve the king I did not return to the capital to serve as your puppet To watch you stack the small council with sycophants Sending your own brother away so he wouldnt be
My brother has left the capital to lead a sensitive diplomatic mission
What mission
That is not your concern as Master of War
I do not recognize your authority to dictate what is and is not my concern You are the Queen Mother Nothing more
You would abandon your king in his time of need
If he wants to send for me I will be waiting for him At Casterly Rock
Come on You know this one It looks like an animal
Snake Snake S Its an S
Right very good
Hmm Did you know that the youngest Lord Commander in history Osric Stark was elected at the age of 10
I know S
Youll learn I promise I taught Ser Davos and old people are terrible at learning new things
Well youre a wonderful teacher Very patient
I only said that the more time you spend practicing the faster youll be able to read
Thats alright Were doing just fine Im sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about
How old were you when you learned to read
Three
Three Who taught you your mother
No Old Maester Cressen did I had a lot of time to practice My mother kept me inside because
What do you call it in the South what happened to your face
Greyscale What do you call it north of the Wall
I dont know But two of my sisters had it They both died How did they cure you
I dont remember I was a baby Lots of people came and tried I think Whatever they did it went away What happened to your sisters
My father made them move out of the keep into the huts outside None of us were allowed to go near them But we heard them Especially at night They started to sound not like themselves
Did you ever see them
Only once at the end They were covered with it Their faces their arms They acted like animals My father had to drag them out to the woods on a rope
What did he do to them in the woods
Mother
Leave us
Your Grace
You need to stay away from that girl
Why
Shes a wildling
Her names Gilly Shes nice Im teaching her to read
Shes a wildling Your father defeated their people He executed her king for treason They could strike at him by striking at you
Gilly wouldnt do that
You have no idea what people will do All your books and you still dont know
I ordered Mance Rayder burnt at the stake You prevented that order from being carried out You showed mercy to Mance Rayder A kings word is law Perhaps you should ask Ser Davos how much mercy I show to lawbreakers Show too much kindness people wont fear you If people dont fear you they dont follow you
With respect Your Grace the free folk will never follow you no matter what you do Youre the man who burned their king alive
Who then You
No Only one of their own
Do you know this wretched girl Lyanna Mormont
The Lord Commanders niece
Lady of Bear Island and a child of 10 I asked her to commit her house to my cause thats her response
Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark
That amuses you
I apologize Your Grace Northerners can be a bit like the free folk Loyal to their own
I know My brother Robert went on often and loudly about how difficult it was to control them even with your fathers help
Tonight the Nights Watch elect a new Lord Commander Ser Alliser Thorne is going to win
Most likely
Unpleasant man He thinks youre a traitor Whats your life going to be like on the Wall with Thorne in command
Unpleasant I expect
Your bravery made him look weak Hell punish you for it I dont punish men for bravery I reward them
I dont doubt it Your Grace But Im a brother of the Nights Watch Ive pledged them my life my honor my sword I dont know what I have left to give you
You can give me the North
I cant Even if I wanted to Im a bastard A Snow
Kneel before me Lay your sword at my feet Pledge me your service and youll rise again as Jon Stark Lord of Winterfell
Hell make you a Stark with the stroke of a pen
Its the first thing I ever remember wanting Id daydream that my father would ask the king and just like that I would never be the bastard of Winterfell again
You deserve this You do I couldnt be happier for you
Im going to refuse him
But youd be Lord of Winterfell
I swore a vow to the Nights Watch If I dont take my own word seriously what sort of Lord of Winterfell would I be
Crowded Youd think we were serving venison stew
Does anyone wish to speak for candidates before we cast our tokens for the 998th Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
Ser Alliser Thorne is not just a knight hes a man of true nobility He was acting commander when the Wall came under attack and led us to victory against the wildlings
Hear hear
Hes a veteran of 100 battles and has been a defender of the Watch and the Wall almost all of his life Hes the only true choice
Is there anyone else
Ser Denys Mallister joined the Watch as a boy and has served loyally longer than any other ranger Through 10 winters he served As commander of the Shadow Tower he kept the wildlings away We could do no better
If theres no one else we will begin the voting The triangular tokens count for Ser Alliser Thorne The square tokens for Ser Denys Mallister Each brother will
Maester Aemon
Samwell Tarly Go on
Sam the Slayer
Another wildling lover just like his friend Jon Snow Hows your lady love Slayer
Her name is Gilly Brother Slynt knows her quite well They cowered together in the larder during the battle for the Wall
Lies
A wildling girl a baby and Lord Janos I found him there when the battle was over in a puddle of his own making
Whilst Lord Janos was hiding with the women and children Jon Snow was leading
Ser Alliser fought bravely it is true And when he was wounded it is Jon who saved us He took charge of the walls defense He killed the Magnar of the Thenns He went North to deal with Mance Rayder knowing it almost certainly meant his own death Before that he led the mission to avenge Lord Commander Mormont Mormont himself chose Jon to be his steward He saw something in Jon and now weve all seen it too He may be young but hes the commander we turned to when the night was darkest
I cant argue with any of that But who does Jon Snow want to command Nights Watch or the wildlings Everyone knows he loved a wildling girl and spoke with Mance Rayder many times What would have happened in that tent between those two old friends if Stanniss army hadnt come along We all saw him put the KingbeyondtheWall out of his misery Do you want to choose a man who has fought the wildlings all his life or a man who makes love to them
It is time
It appears to be a tie Maester
Jon Snow Jon Snow Jon Snow Jon Snow
You You
What have you got there
I said
Turn around and go Turn around and go
Thats a nice little sword Worth 100 pieces a sword like that
Nothings worth anything to dead men
Quickly go go
Who are you Why were they scared of you
You lost this
You said there was no Jaqen Hghar here
There isnt A man is not Jaqen Hghar
Well who are you then
No one And that is who a girl must become
She doesnt belong here And no matter how many of your traitors call her Mhysa  she will never be your mother
Why
For you Mhysa You wanted the Harpy dead but your hands were tied I set you free as you did all of us
He was our prisoner awaiting trial You had no right
He would rather rip your city apart than see slaves lifted from the dirt
There are no more slaves There are no more Masters
Then who lives in the Pyramids Who wears gold masks and murders your children When Grey Worm came to us I was the first to take up the knife for you I remember the look on my fathers face as I struck down his Master who had traded his infant son for a dog My father died in the fighting If we allow the Sons of the Harpy to return us to chains he never lived
The Harpys life was not yours to take Once the Masters were the law
and now you are the law
The law is the law Take him
Mhysa Myhsa
She should have cut off the traitors head in the Great Pyramid and been done with it
Which is what I keep telling her to do to you
You opened your gates to me because I promised you freedom and justice One cannot exist without the other
Brother Brother
Mhysa please Forgive me
A citizen of Meereen was awaiting trial and this man murdered him The punishment is death
Mercy Mercy
Mhysa
Mhysa
Ill stand guard outside your door tonight Your Grace
We all guard tonight
Leave me
Valar morghulis
Valar dohaeris
Ive been sweeping this floor for days
Good
I didnt come here to sweep floors
No Why come then
You said that I could be your apprentice You said youd teach me how to a Faceless Man
A man teaches a girl Valar dohaeris All men must serve Faceless men most of all
I want to serve
A girl wants to serve herself Here we serve the ManyFaced God to serve well A girl must become noone
Which one is the ManyFaced God I see the Stranger I see the Drowned God I see the Weirwood Face
There is only one god A girl knows his name And all men know his gift
Where are they taking him
Queen Margaery Queen Margaery Queen Margaery MARGAERY
I am hishers and shehe is mine From this day until the end of my days
Did I hurt you
No You were lovely
It all happened so fast
Yes
I was scared maybe I hurt you
No no no Youre very sweet The sweetest king who ever lived
This is what I want to do all day every day for the rest of my life
Wouldnt that be glorious Shouldnt we rest a little while Just to catch our breath theres no rush is there
Of course not Are you hungry Shall I have them bring you some cake or pomegranate juice
No Im fine I just want you all to myself I want to know everything there is to know about King Tommen First of His Name
King Tommen It still sounds strange to me Does Queen Margaery sound strange to you
So strange Husband
Wife Sometimes it feels odd Im the king Ive married the most beautiful woman in the world  and its all because my brother died
I understand But its not your fault you know that dont you You mustnt feel guilty
I dont feel guilty Thats whats odd
Do you like to sail
I love to sail
I do too
I think were going to be very happy you and I
I do too
Living in a tower so high it touches the clouds Of course my grandmother couldnt wait to go home The capital is not for everyone I suppose Does your mother like it here
I dont think so She told me never to trust anyone in Kings Landing
Its so wonderful to have her watching over you A lioness guiding her cub
Well but Im a man now
You are And the king But youll always be her babyboy
I suppose
I adore how she has always been so generous with me so kind And the horror shes had to injure Losing her husband her eldest child and her father Its no wonder shes so protective of you Shell never let you out of her sight
You look very much in love The first days of marriage are often so blissful Shes certainly very pretty isnt she Like a doll she smiles quite a lot Do you think shes intelligent I cant quite tell Not that it matters
Do you ever miss Casterly Rock
Theres nothing for me in Casterly Rock
Thats where you grew up You always told me that you liked the people there better You said that Kings Landing smelled of horse dung and sour milk
Why are we speaking of Casterly Rock
The way that you talked about it I always thought that you missed it That you That it was your real home
This is my real home now Where my family lives
I want you to be happy mother
I know that I know you do my sweet boy
But wouldnt you be happier in Casterly Rock
I said Darling surely 4 times is enough are you trying to set a new record And he said Well what is the record Im sure we can break it
Mother Welcome
Dont you look lovely Marriage agrees with you
Can we bring you anything to eat or drink I wish we had some wine for you Its a bit early in the day for us
No no I I cant stay I just wanted to let you know if there is ever anything I can do for you
You are very sweet
Tommen seems quite taken with his new queen
I absolutely adore him You raised a gallant young man Im forever grateful
Good Good Im glad to hear youre happy
Ecstatic I really am Exhausted to be honest but what can I expect he is half lion half stag
Ill leave you to it then
Oh forgive me I havent been at Court for long I get so confused Whats the proper way to address you now Queen Mother or Dowager Queen
Theres no need for such formalities
In any event judging from the Kings enthusiasm the Queen Mother will be a Queen Grandmother soon
Wont that be a lovely day
Can you imagine the celebrations Theyll ring the bells all day and night
Remember Anything you need
We cant hold the North with terror alone
You cant hold the North if you let these lesser lords insult us
I sent you there to collect taxes not bodies
Lord Cerwyn refused to pay Said the Warden of the North would always be a Stark and hed be damned if he kissed a traitors boot
He left you no choice
I flayed him living along with his wife and brother Made his son watch
And
The new Lord Cerwyn paid his taxes
I have something important to tell you Stop eating and listen
We dont have enough men to hold the North if the other Houses rise up against us Do you understand that
Our pact with the Lannisters protects
I had a pact with Tywin Lannister and Tywin Lannister is dead The remaining Lannisters are a thousand miles away dealing with that fact Theyve never once in the history of the Seven Kingdoms sent their army this far north If you think they will for us youre a fool We become a great house by entering in alliances with other houses and parleying those alliances into greater power The best way to forge a lasting alliance isnt by peeling a mans skin off The best way is marriage Now that youre a Bolton by royal decree its time you married a suitable bride And as it happens I found the perfect girl to solidify our hold in the North
Thats Moat Cailin
Yes A bit shabby isnt it Youve been here before
On our way down to Kings Landing with my father and Arya and where are you taking me
Home
The Boltons have Winterfell The marriage proposal it wasnt for you
No
Roose Bolton murdered my brother He betrayed my family
He serves the Lannisters
For now
I wont go
Winterfell is your home
Not anymore
Always Youre a Stark Dyeing your hair doesnt change that Youre Sansa Stark The eldest surviving child of Ned and Catelyn Stark Your place is in the North
I cant marry him You cant make me Hes a traitor A murderer
Youre not marrying Roose Bolton No youll be marrying his son and heir Ramsay One day hell be Warden of the North and you will
No
Sansa
No you cant make me I will starve myself I will die before I have to go there
I wont force you to do anything Dont you know by now how much I care for you Say the word and we turn the horses round but listen to me Listen Youve been running all your life Terrible things happened to your family and you weep You sit alone in a darkened room mourning their fates Youve been a bystander to tragedy from the day they executed your father Stop being a bystander do you hear me Stop running Theres no justice in the world Not unless we make it You loved your family Avenge them
How do we get through there
We dont We go around
It sets miles out of the way Well lose sight of them
Doesnt matter I know where theyre going
Arent you getting a bit old to be a squire How did you end up squiring for the Imp
He hates that nickname
Well hes not here to complain about it is he
I squired for a knight name Ser Lorimer during the War of the Five Kings One night he had a bit too much to drink And he was famished so he borrowed a ham
He borrowed it
He wasnt a thief He was drunk and hungry and he wasnt thinking I was drunk too He gave me half the ham Next morning one of the guards saw him passed out under a wagon with the ham bone still in his hand They hanged the man afternoon They tied the noose for me too but Lord Tywin heard my family name was Payne So he pardoned me and sent me to Kings Landing to squire for his son
As punishment For both of you
It didnt seem that way Lord Tyrion was always very good to me
Yes all of your lords were very kind to you All except me Sorry you have to squire such a nasty person
Im not sorry Youre the best fighter Ive ever seen You beat The Hound Im proud to be your squire
Im sorry Im always snapping at you
If you wouldnt snap at me I wouldnt learn anything
You want to be a knight Pod
Yes
Starting tomorrow well train with the sword twice a day before we ride in the morning and after we camp for the evening And Im going to show you how to ride properly
Thank you
I cant knight you but I can teach you how to fight
I suppose thats more important
You werent a knight but you were a Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon werent you
I was
Lord Tyrion said he was a good man
He was
But how did you end up serving Renly
When I was a girl my father held a ball Im his only living child so he wants to make a good match for me He invited dozens of young lords to Tarth I didnt want to go but he dragged me to the ballroom And it was wonderful None of the boys noticed how mulish and tall I was The shoved each other and threatened to duel if they thought it was their turn to dance And whispered in my ear how they wanted to marry me and take me back to their castles My father smiled at me and I smiled at him Id never been so happy Till I saw a few of the boys sniggering And then they all started to laugh they couldnt keep the game going any longer They were toying with me Brienne the Beauty they called me Great joke And I realized I was the ugliest girl alive A great lumbering beast I tried to run away but Renly Baratheon took me in his arms Dont let them see your tears he told me Theyre nasty little shits The nasty little shits arent worth crying over He danced with me and none of the other boys could say a word And he was the kings brother after all
But wasnt he Lord Tyrion said he was
Yes Pod he liked men Im not an idiot He didnt love me he didnt want me he danced with me because he was kind and he wouldnt see me hurt He saved me from being a joke From that day until his last day And I couldnt save him in return Nothings more hateful than failing to protect the one you love One day I will avenge King Renly
But you said a shadow murdered him How do you fight a shadow
A shadow with the face of Stannis Baratheon I know it was Stannis I know it in my heart Stannis is a man not a shadow And a man can be killed
Lord Commander
Your Grace
Id like to speak alone
Olly is my steward now as I was Lord Commander Mormonts I want him to attend my meetings to learn from men with experience One day he might command
Very well Have you considered my offer
I have And I thank you for it You do me great honor All my life I wanted to be Jon Stark
Say the word and you will be
But I have to refuse you Im Lord Commander of the Nights Watch My place is here
Im giving you a chance to avenge your family To take back the castle where you grew up To rule the North
I wish I could fight beside you Believe me I do But I swore a sacred vow at the Godswood I pledged my life to the Nights Watch
Youre as stubborn as your father And as honorable
I can imagine no higher praise
I didnt mean it as praise Honor got your father killed But if your minds made up I wont try to persuade you
May I ask Your Grace how long you plan to stay at Castle Black
Are you bored of us already
You saved us from Mance Rayders army We will never forget that But its a question of survival The Nights Watch cant continue to feed your men and the wildling prisoners indefinitely Winter is coming
I know it We march on Winterfell within the fortnight Before the snows trap us here
And the wildlings
Theyd rather burn than fight for me so be it I leave their fate to you You could execute them thats the safest course Or you could see if this Tormund fellow is more willing to compromise than Mance ever was I assume the brothers of the Nights Watch would rather see the wildlings dead
Most of the brothers yes Theres little love for the free folk here
Youre the Lord Commander Your decision
You have many enemies in Castle Black Have you considered sending Alliser Thorne elsewhere Give him command of EastwatchbytheSea
I heard it was best to keep your enemies close
Whoever said that didnt have many enemies
He sees something in you Might not be apparent from his tone but its the truth He believes in you
Im sorry I disappointed him
The king is a complicated man But he wants whats right for the Seven Kingdoms
As long as hes ruling them
Hes the one true king He has the blood right to that throne
Ive sworn to stay clear of the politics of the Seven Kingdoms
Have you now How does the Nights Watch vow go again I bet youve got it memorized since you got here
Night gathers and now my watch begins
Not that bit the bit at the end
Im the sword in the darkness the watcher on the walls the shield that guards the realm of men I pledge my life
Wait thats enough The shield that guards the realm of men Thats what you swore to be Now Im not a learned man but the best way of helping the most people might not be sitting in a frozen castle at the edge of the world It just might mean wading in the muck getting your boots dirty and doing what needs to be doing
And what needs to be done
As long as the Boltons rule the North  the North will suffer Just one mans opinion
What do you want
Who are you
What
You who walk in here with a coin you never earned whose value you do not respect Who are you
No one
Ow Cunt
A lie a sad little lie Who are you
I told you Im no Do that again and
Who are you
Youre about to find out
What are you doing
We were only playing The game of faces
A girl is not ready
Clearly not
I am ready
For what For whatever you want To be a Faceless Man To be no one
Whose sword is that It belongs to Arya Stark Arya Starks sword Arya Starks clothes Arya Starks stolen silver A man wonders how is it that no one came to be surrounded by Arya Starks things
What do we do with them after we wash them
Open gates
Lady Sansa welcome
Lord Bolton
May I introduce my son  Ramsay Bolton
Its an honor to meet you my Lady
Ill bring you a bowl of hot water You must want to wash
Thank you
Welcome home Lady Stark The North remembers
Sam Maester Aemon
He apologizes for not being here Hes not feeling well
Take good care of him Brothers As you all know too well its long past time to dig a new latrine pit First Builder Yarwyck and I have decided to appoint a latrine captain to oversee this crucial task Brian Seems like a good job for a ginger
Ser Alliser You have more experience than any other soldier at Castle Black You proved your valour many times over while defending the Wall from the wildling attack I name you First Ranger
Lord Janos Im giving you command of Greyguard
Greyguard is a ruin
Yes the fort is in a sorry state Restore it as best you can First Builder Yarwyck can spare ten of his
I was charged with the defense of Kings Landing when you were soiling your swaddling clothes Keep your ruin
Alright alright Enough of that
You mistake me my Lord That was a command not an offer Pack your arms and armour say your farewells and ride for Greyguard
I will not go meekly off to freeze and die Give it to one of the fools who cast a stone for you I will not have it Do you hear me boy I will not have it
Are you refusing to obey my order
You can stick your order up your bastard arse
Take Lord Janos outside
Olly bring me my sword
You cannot do this Get your hands off me Scum all of you If the boy thinks he can frighten me hes mistaken yes very mistaken
A disgrace I have friends important friends in the capital Youll see
If you have any last words my Lord now is the time
I was wrong Youre the Lord Commander We all serve you Im sorry Not only for this for all Ive done and said I was wrong My Lord please mercy Mercy Ill go I will Please Im afraid Ive always been afraid
You have served us well my son
Thank you Father
Which of the Seven will you worship today
The Maiden
Where is the Maiden
And the Stranger
Two is extra you realize
Yes yes
What are you doing This establishment belong to Lord Petyr Baelish You cant
You have profaned our faith The faith of our fathers and forefathers
I am the High Septon of the
You are a sinner And you shall be punished
Sinner Sinner Sinner
Repent
Sinner Sinner Sinner Sinner Sinner Sinner
Shame on you
Sinner Sinner
Your Grace  Grandmaester Lord Tyrell  uh
It doesnt matter
As the High Septon of the Faith of the Seven I give voice to the will of the Gods and am their foremost servant in this world An insult to me is an insult to the Gods An assault on my person is an assault on our very religion
You were assaulted
I was by those fanatics who call themselves sparrows They humiliated me they they beat me they left me naked and bleeding on the cobblestones I am lucky to be alive
I heard this all began in Littlefingers brothel
High Septon this is a rather shocking thing to hear
I tend to both the highest born and the lowliest amongst us Even prostitutes may earn the mercy of the Mother
So you were administering to the needs of these devout prostitutes
A mans private affairs ought to stay private
What do you want from us High Septon
Justice I ask that you protect our Faith by arresting these criminals and throwing them in the black cells I ask that you execute their leader this socalled High Sparrow Hes a threat to everything we hold sacred If he goes unpunished
And where do I find this man This High Sparrow
I dont think this is a good idea Your Grace
Nonsense These are deeply religious people Where can I find the High Sparrow
Seven blessings
Thank you
Just a little more
Thank you ever so for the soup
A young man said I would find the High Sparrow back here Where is he
High Sparrow Sounds ridiculous doesnt it Like Lord Duckling or King Turtle So its meant to Were often stuck with the names our enemies give to us The notion that we are all equal in the eyes of Seven doesnt sit well with some so they belittle me
Seven blessings to you
Seven blessings to you my dear Its only a name quite an easy burden to wear Far easier than hers
Why no shoes
Because I gave them away to someone who needed them more We all do that It stops us from forgetting what we really are
Is that why you came to Kings Landing To remind everyone
Everyone I have a hard enough job reminding myself Oh I tell them no ones special And they think Im special for telling them so
Perhaps theyre right
It would be comforting to believe that wouldnt it The Gods sent you here to tempt me I hope not I had assumed youd only come here to arrest me For that incident with the High Septon
An unacceptable way to treat the chosen representative of the Gods in this world wouldnt you say
Hypocrisy is a boil Lancing a is never pleasant Although they could have been more careful with the blade
The High Septon came to speak to me today He doesnt want me to arrest you he wants me to execute you
I wouldnt presume to know your thoughts on the matter
My thoughts on the matter align with your own The High Septons behaviour was corrosive as was his attitude Having a man like that reside in the Sept eats away the Faith from the inside So now he resides in the Red Keeps dungeons instead The Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world If one collapses so does the other We must do everything necessary to protect one another
Your Grace
Send a raven with this message to Littlefinger in the Eyrie or wherever hes slithering about
At once Your Grace
Hows your work coming along
Very well
Youve made progress
More than Ive expected Still a way to go but
Very good Ill leave you to it then Make sure Littlefinger is clear on the meaning of the word immediately
Shh Easy friend
She really is lovely I hope I can make her happy
I hope so too Ive become quite fond of Lady Sansa during our travels together Shes suffered enough
Ill never hurt her You have my word
Ive heard very little about you Which makes you quite a rare thing as lords go
I havent been a lord very long I was a bastard
And youre not anymore Allow me a moment alone with Lord Baelish
Yes father And thank you Lord Baelish Im forever in your debt
He seems pleased
Shouldnt he be
I assure you shes still a virgin Tyrion never consummated the marriage By the law of the land shes no mans wife Inspect her if you must
I leave that to the brothel keeper Its her name I need not her virtue
Then I have delivered everything Ive promised
And you prepared for the consequences When the Lannisters hear Ive wed Sansa Stark to Ramsay
The Lannister name doesnt mean what it once did Tywin is dead He kept his house in power through sheer will Without him Jaime has one hand and no allies Tommen is a soft boy not a king to fear
The Queen will be enraged
Queen Margaery adores Sansa Cersei is Queen Mother a title whose importance wanes with each passing day
And yet she still has friends Men in important places whom she can ask for favours A message for you from Cersei Lannister A rider arrived from Eyrie shortly before dawn Apparently she thinks youre still in the Vale
A message for me you say Strange that the seal is broken
Im sure you understand my position Lord Baelish If you received word in the night from the Queen Mother it does make me question our new alliance The Lannisters made you one of the great lords of Westeros Yet here you are in the North undermining them Why gamble with your position
Every ambitious move is a gamble You gambled when you drove a dagger into Robb Starks heart It appears that your gamble paid off Youre Warden of the North
I had Tywin Lannister backing Who supports me now You
The Eyrie is mine The last time the lords of the Eyrie formed an alliance with the lords of the North they brought down the greatest dynasty this world has ever known Id like to borrow one of your birds Cersei will expect a reply
Id like to read the reply
I have to get out of this wheelhouse
Volantis is a large city
I have to get out of this wheelhouse
The likelihood of you being spotted here increases a hundredfold
Mm I have to get out of this wheelhouse
Im not sure how many new ways I can find of saying this
I will not be of any use to Daenerys Targaryen if I lose my mind I cant remember the last face I saw that wasnt yours
Its a perfectly good face
Im losing my mind
If anyone recognizes you youll lose more than that
Look we are thousands of miles from Westeros What am I One more drunk dwarf
Slaves
Yes The Volantene masters are very organized Flies for dung shovelers Hammers for builders Tears for whores Lest they forget
Lord cast your light upon us
Lord cast your light upon us
For the night is dark and full of terrors
We should keep moving
For the night is dark and full of terrors
I was once as you are now
Bought and sold  scourged and branded
The only red priest we had in Kings Landing was Thoros of Myr This ones much better looking
The Lord of Light hears your voice He hears the king as he hears the slave he hears the Stone Men in their misery
Stone men Good luck stopping this spread of grayscale with prayer Youd have better luck dancing away the plague
He has sent you a saviour From the fire she was reborn to remake the world The Dragon Queen
Were going to meet the Saviour You should have told me Who doesnt want to meet the Saviour
Come on Lets find a brothel
Its good luck to rub a dwarfs head
Its even better luck to suck a dwarfs cock
See We blend right in Just two more travellers mad with lust
Thank you
Curious hair
The mother of dragons
It appears youre not the only Targaryen supporter
Someone who inspires priests and whores is worth taking seriously
What makes you worth that much
Im magic
I bet you bloody are
Well  shes taken
Wherere you going
I need to speak to someone with hair
Hello
Hello
Youve got no drink
Youve got no money
Do I look like a man without money Never trust looks Until quite recently I was one of the richest men in the world But who needs wealth when you can make a woman laugh I always pay my debts Im well known for it
You like her They all like her They all want to fuck a queen
Thats because theyve never met a queen
Youre just saying that
You know how to spot a liar If I could pick any girl here I would pick you
Why
Because you have a skeptical mind
Alright then Im warning you Were gonna have to wash you first
Come on
Im Im sorry I cant
Of course you can Youre shy
Im not
Have another drink
Gladly but this I cant do Believe me no one is more shocked than I am I hope it passes What will I do in my spare time Ill go for a piss thats a start
No need to worry I was just Oh I thought you were someone else Shows almost over Im sure the girls inside will be happy to oblige
You made some kind of mistake Why dont you tell me what you think you are doing and
Is that Estermont
Tarth Ser Jaime The Sapphire Isle
Why are we on a merchant ship Why no Lannister sails
This ships sailing to Oldtown Well get off earlier not far from Sunspear Row ourselves to the Dornish shores in the night
You ever been to Dorne
No
I have The Dornish are crazy All they want to do is fight and fuck Fuck and fight
You should be happy to go back
Theres nothing like a good fight to get you in the mood for fucking And theres nothing like a fuckmad Dornish girl to clear your head for the next fight Its how the two work together And were gonna do a lot of fighting I am sure Well I am But I dont imagine well get to stick around for the rest Not after weve kidnapped their princess
We are not kidnapping their princess We are rescuing my niece bringing her back to the family
Your niece
Ive been doing this sort of thing a long time Im good at it
Thats why youre here
I know Why are you here Why not send 40 of me or an army Unlike most folks you actually got one
Because I dont want to start a war
That still doesnt explain why youre doing it
It has to be me
If Im putting something of a lit together a onehanded man  who happens to be one of the most recognizable faces in Westeros is not
It has to be me
You set your brother free didnt you I bet your sister didnt like that
Varys set him free
Well if you ever see the little fucker  give him my regards
He murdered my father If I ever see him Ill split him in two And then Ill give him your regards
The Iron Bank has called one tenth of the Crowns debts Given the expense of rebuilding the royal
How much can the Crown afford
With winter coming half what they ask Less
Youre the Master of Coin How do we pay them
Well House Tyrell could front the gold and the the Crown will pay us back in time or Ill have words with my daughter
Youve already given us too much No we must arrange better terms with the Iron Bank
Absolutely
In person
Me
We must send an envoy to the Iron Bank someone of importance to show these bankers our respect As the Kings Master of Coin I can think of no one more qualified
I will be honored Your Grace
ing has expressed concern about his fatherinlaws safety on this voyage Hes ordered Ser Meryn to personally lead your escort
My very own Kingsguard Please express
Safe travels Lord Tyrell
Of course of course Ill give your regards to the Titan of Braavos
The Small Council grows smaller and smaller
Not small enough
May I offer you some wine Your Holiness
No
The old High Septon would have asked the vintage
I could say that our minds are temples to the Seven and should be kept pure But the truth is  I dont like the taste
Hmm
How may I serve
All over Westeros we hear about septs being burned Silent sisters raped Bodies of holy men piled in the streets
Wars teach people to obey the sword not the Gods
Perhaps the Gods need a sword of their own In the days before the Targaryens the Faith Militant dispensed the justice of the Seven
Well the Faith Militant was disarmed more than two centuries ago
If I explain the holy purpose to my son the king I have no doubt he will sign a decree arming the believers you felt worthy
An army that defends the bodies and souls of the common people
An army and service to the Gods themselves And to you of course As the chosen representative of the Seven
An honor I never expected Or indeed ever wished for
Which is why you were chosen You and I both know how the world works Too often the wicked are the wealthiest beyond the reach of justice The king himself cannot always punish those who deserve it most
All sinners are equal before the Gods
What would you say if I told you we have a great sinner in our very midst Shielded by gold and privilege
May the Father judge him justly
Help me Help me
This is Lord Petyr Baelishs establishment
Cocksucker Boy fucker You barbaric filth Theres a special place in the Seventh Hell for your kind
Please please Ill pay Ill pay all of you
Yes you will Seize him
Seize him
Get your hands off of me
Ser Loras of House Tyrell you have broken the laws of Gods and men
Who do you think you are
Justice
Why is my brother in a cell
I I dont know I I didnt order it
We both know who did You told me she was returning to Casterly Rock
Are you saying my mother is behind this
Shes jealous youre not hers anymore Arresting my brother is her revenge
Arent you and mother getting along
Oh my sweet sweet King Do you have any affection for me at all
Of course I do Youre my Queen
I cant bear to think of my brother locked away in some grimy cell
Ill set him free for you
Do you promise
I demand that Ser Loras be freed now
Did I arrest him
Well no But you armed the Faith Militant You gave the High Sparrow an army
I did And your wife has every right to criticize Cant allow fanatics to arrest the Queens brother no matter his perversions
Then can I tell Margaery youll have Ser Loras released
I told you I am not holding Ser Loras Youre the King Im sure if you speak to the High Sparrow hell release the poor boy
Halt
His Holiness is praying He will not be disturbed
Give the order and well tear out this rebel
You mean kill them Here in the sept
Youll be sending them to meet the Gods that they love
Bastard
Youre an abomination
Youre born of sin
Filthy bastard
Well find another way
Abomination
My Queen
There was no way to free Ser Loras without violence
Youre the King of the Andals the Lord of the Seven Kingdoms the Protector of the Realm And you let a band of fanatics imprison your brother by law
Im going to speak to the High Sparrow
Are you When
I I dont know
You dont know
He was praying just now
I have to send word to Grandmother
Will you come back later
I need to be with my family Your Grace
Of course
You think highly of this boy
Good
Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
A bastard by some tavern slut
Perhaps but that wasnt Ned Starks way
I should have given you a son
Not your fault
Whose then I gave you nothing but weakness And deformity
Those scars mean nothing to the Lord of Light
My Lady
Her father is the Lords chosen King And her fathers blood runs through her veins
You march on Winterfell soon
We must To beat the snows
Once before you put your faith in Ser Davos and left me behind I hope you wont make that mistake again
I wont I need you
You only need faith my King
And you my Lady what do you need
To serve my Lord
Lord Ashford Lady Caulfield Lord Smallwood
Never even heard of these people
They havent heard of you either But we need men and they have some
And how many men does this Lord Mazin have to send us
More than Lord Wibberley
Not him
I know Im sorry but we need men and supplies And Roose Bolton is the Warden of The North
He murdered my brother
We swore to be the Watchers on the Wall We cant watch the Wall with 50 men And we cant get more men without help from the Warden of the North
Apologies my Lady
Lord Commander
How can I help you
Come with us when we ride south None of us know the castle as well as you do Its hidden tunnels its weaknesses its people Winterfell was your home once Dont you want to chase the rats out of it
Castle Black is my home now Nights Watch takes no part in the wars of the Seven Kingdoms
Theres only one war Life against death Come Let me show what youre fighting for
Youre gonna show me some vision in the fire Forgive me my Lady But I dont trust in visions
No visions No magic Just life
Do you feel my heart beating This power in you you resist it and thats your mistake Embrace it
The Lord of Light made us male and female Two parts of a greater whole We are joining this power Power to make life power to make light and power to cast shadows
I dont think Stannis would like that very much
Then we shouldnt tell him
I cant
Why
I swore a vow I loved another
The dead dont need lovers Only the living
I know But I still love her
You know nothing Jon Snow
Are you lonely
Just bored
My father used to tell me that boredom indicates a lack of inner resources
Were you bored a lot too
I know Castle Black is no place for a child but I
I like it I thought Id be left at home I know mother didnt want to bring me
Why do you say that
She told me I dont want to bring you
She shouldnt have said that
Are you ashamed of me father
When you were an infant  the Dornish trailer landed on Dragonstone His goods were junk except for one wooden doll Hed even sewn a dress on it in the colors of our House No doubt hed heard of your birth and assumed new fathers were easy targets I still remember how you smiled when I put that doll in your cradle  and you pressed it to your cheek By the time we burnt the doll it was too late I was told you would die Or worse the grayscale would go slow Let you grow just enough to know the world before taking it away from you Everyone advised me to send you to the ruins of Valyria to live out your short life with the Stone men before the sickness spread to the castle I told them all to go to hell I called in every maester on this side of the world Every healer every apothecary They stopped the disease and saved your life Because you did not belong across the world with the bloody Stone men You are the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon And you are my daughter
I thought I might find you here Your Aunt Lyanna
Father never talked about her Sometimes Id find him down here lighting the candles They say she was beautiful
I saw her once I was a boy living with your mothers family Lord Whent had a great tourney at Harrenhal Everyone was there The Mad King your father Robert Baratheon And Lyanna she was already promised to Robert You can imagine what it was like for me a boy from nowhere with nothing to his name watching these legendary men tilting at the lists The last two riders were Barristan Selmy and Rhaegar Targaryen When Rhaegar won everyone cheered for the prince I remember the girls laughing when he took off his helmet and they saw that silver hair How handsome he was Until he rode right past his wife Elia Martell and all the smiles died Ive never seen so many people so quiet He rode past his wife and he lay a crown of winter roses in Lyannas lap Blue as frost How many tens of thousands had to die because Rhaegar chose your aunt
Yes he chose her and then he kidnapped her and raped her
Come Lets speak somewhere the dead cant hear us
Dressed for riding
I am
Where are you going
Kings Landing
Kings Landing
Cersei sent for me We must not let her sniff out any trouble
You cant leave me here
I know how hard it is to live with people you despise believe me But it wont be for long
How do you know
Stannis Baratheon garrisons at Castle Black Hell march south to Kings Landing before the winter snows block his way But first he has to take Winterfell
You dont know that
I do Once he liberates these lands from the Boltons hell rally your fathers bannermen to his cause With the North behind him Stannis can finally take the Iron Throne
You think hell defeat the Boltons
He has a larger army Hes the finest military commander in Westeros A betting man would put his money on Stannis As it happens I am a betting man
And if youre right
Stannis takes Winterfell he rescues you from the most despised family in the North Grateful for your late fathers courageous support for his claim he names you Wardeness of the North
But I I wouldnt Wardeness of the North
You are the last surviving Stark He needs you
What if youre wrong What if Stannis never attacks Winterfell or he does and the Boltons defeat him
Then you will take this Bolton boy Ramsay and make him yours
I dont know how to do that
Of course you do Hes already fallen for you
His father frightens me
He should hes a dangerous man But even the most dangerous men can be outmaneuvered And youve learnt to maneuver from the very best I return before too long Youll be strong without me The North will be yours Do you believe me
I expect Ill be a married woman by the time you return
Breakfast
That would have been a shit way to die
As far as Ive seen theyre all shit ways to die
Aye But your lot like to give the singers a good ending
I dont care whats sung about me when Im dead
No Two knights off to rescue a princess Sounds like a good song to me
Sounds like all the rest
What about you What shit way would you choose
In my own keep drinking my own wine watching my sons grovel for my fortune
How disappointing I thought youd have something more exciting planned
Ive had an exciting life I want my death to be boring How do you want to go
In the arms of the woman I love
She want the same thing
Lets go
The captain to that ship What was he Braavosi
Pentoshi
And hes headed to Oldtown
As I said Why
Whats to stop him from docking down the coast and telling the locals that Jaime Lannisters in Dorne
A bag of gold
Im not sure you understand how much people hate your family in this part of the world
It was a heavy bag
And I bet he swore all kinds of oaths to get it But you wont be around if he breaks them
How many you count
Four
How many you think you can take
One if hes slow
Halt
Fucked in the arse Hiya Morning lads Glad we found you
Who are you
Cooper This is Darnell
Youre from Kings Landing
Accent gave me away Flea Bottom Whelped and whipped
Why are you here
Our ship capsized in the night We managed to swim ashore It was a near thing really
I thought the sharks would get us
There are no sharks in Dorne
I could have sworn those were shark fins
Dolphins maybe
Throw your swords in the sand
Boys theres no need for this Just point us in the right direction Well find our way home
Swords in the sand Now
That one should be slow enough
Nice move
Luck
You had a wonderful teacher
Always wanted a Dornish stallion Beasts can run a day and night without tiring Well ride to the Water Gardens with a nice breeze in our face
First we need to bury these bodies
Birds have to eat too
Corpses raise questions questions raise armies Were not here to start a war
Do you know how long it will take us to dig all those holes
I cant dig very well with one hand Not at all really
Nama
Nym Obara
Will it be war
Prince Doran will weep for your father but nothing else We must avenge Oberyn ourselves
Without Doran we have no army to march against the Lannisters
We dont need an army to start a war Queen Cersei loves her children and we have one of them
We may have a problem
A ships captain who found me in Planky Town claiming he had information to sell He told me he smuggled Jaime Lannister into Dorne
Hes come for Myrcella If he gets to her before we do we lose our only chance for revenge You must choose Dorans way and peace or my way and war
Im with you Always
Nym Obara
When I was a child  Oberyn came to take me to court Id never seen this man and yet he called himself my father My mother wept said I was too young and a girl Oberyn tossed his spear at my feet and said Girl or boy we fight our battles But the Gods let us choose our weapons My father pointed to the spear and then to my mothers tears
I made my choice long ago
Thank you Who are you
Your captor
Do you have wine
No
I cant sleep without wine
Then stay awake
Youre going the wrong way My sisters in Westeros Westeros is west Were heading east
Im not taking you to your sister
You said you were taking me to the Queen
I am Queen Daenerys Targaryen Shes the Queen I serve
What a waste of a good kidnapping So happens I was heading there myself
What business would you have with the Queen
Gold and glory Oh and hate If youve ever met my sister youd understand So now that its clear were on the same side A high born knight from the North of Westeros down on his luck in Essos Dragon epaulettes Bear sigil breast plate Youre Jorah Mormont I have to ask how exactly were you serving your Queen in a whore house half a world away Is it possible that you were running Why would you be running And why would she have sent you away Oh wait You were spying on her werent you Its all coming back to me I was drunk through most of the Small Council meetings but its all coming back You passed notes to Varyss little birds She found out didnt she Found out and exiled you And now you hope to win back her favor with a gift A risky scheme One might even say desperate Do you think Daenerys would execute me and pardon you Id say the reverse is just as likely
Everyone looks happy enough from up here What
I was thinking of all the times your brother made me go with him down from the Red Keep into the streets of Kings Landing
Why
He liked to walk among the people he liked to sing to them
He sang to them
Yes Rhaegar would take a spot on the Hook or the Street of Seeds and then hed sing Just like all the other minstrels
And what did you do
I made sure no one killed him And I collected the money Well he liked to see how much he could make
He was good
He was very good Viserys never told you
He told me Rhaegar was good at killing people
Rhaegar never liked killing He loved singing
And what did you do with the money
Well one time he gave it to the next minstrel down the street One time he gave it to an orphanage in Flea Bottom One time we got horribly drunk
Your Grace Hizdahr is here waiting in your audience chamber
How many others are there
Fifty a hundred
Will you be joining us Ser Barristan
I think I can protect you from Hizdahr Zo Loraq
I think I can protect me from Hizdahr Zo Loraq Go Ser Barristan Sing a song for me
Your Grace
All men must die But not all can die in glory
Glory
Why else do men fight Why did your ancestors cross the Narrow Sea and conquer the Seven Kingdoms So their names would live on Those who find victory in the fighting pits will never become kings but their names will live on Its the best chance theyll ever have
Is that what you used to tell men before you set them to butchering each other for sport
Your Grace today is the traditional start of the fighting season
I do not recognize this tradition
Traditions are the only thing that will hold this city your city together Without them former slaves and former masters have nothing in common Nothing but centuries of mistrust and resentment I cant promise this is the answer to all our problems but its a start
I am so sorry my queen He was a good man
Barristan the Bold they called him He crossed a continent to serve me He was a loyal friend And he died in an alley butchered by cowards who hide behind masks
We could pull back to the pyramid district secure it and use it as a base from which to operate Then we clean the city out neighborhood by neighborhood street by street until the rats have nowhere left to hide
I prefer your earlier suggestion Round up the leaders of each of Meereens great families and bring them to me
But Im the leader of my family
No Your Grace I had nothing to do with this Your Grace
Walk forward
You cannot do this
Another step
They will eat you if I tell them to They may eat you even if I dont Children Some say I should give up on them But a good mother never gives up on her children She disciplines them if she must
But she does not give up on them
Who is innocent Maybe all of you are  maybe none of you are Maybe  I should let the dragons decide
All men must die
Dont want to overfeed them Tomorrow perhaps
And though Daenerys maintains her grip on Slavers Bay forces rise against her from within and without She refuses to leave until the freedom of the former slaves is secure She sounds like quite a woman
And shes alone under siege no family to guide her or protect her Her last relation thousands of miles away useless dying
Dont say that Maester Aemon
A Targaryen alone in the world is a terrible thing
Maester Aemon
Lord Commander
Sam Id like to speak to the maester alone
How are you feeling
Oh like a hundredyearold man slowly freezing to death
I need your advice Theres something I want to do something I have to do But itll divide the Nights Watch Bitterly Half the men will hate me the moment I give the order
Half the men hate you already Lord Commander Do it
But you dont know what it is
That doesnt matter You do You will find little joy in your command But with luck you will find the strength to do what needs to be done Kill the boy Jon Snow Winter is almost upon us Kill the boy and let the man be born
Where are the rest of the free folk now Where have they gone Who leads them
They followed Mance They wont follow anyone else
What about you
Hard to lead when youre in chains
What if I unchained you
Why would you do that
Because you are not my enemy And Im not yours
You sure seemed like my enemy when you were killing my friends
For 8000 years the Nights Watch have sworn an oath to be the shield that guards the realms of men And for 8000 years weve fallen short of that oath You belong to the realms of men All of you
And now everything is going to change
It is
Why now
Because now  I am Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
What would you have me do  Lord Commander
Id have you go north of the Wall Gather the remaining free folk wherever they are and bring them back here Ill open the gates for them and let them through Ill find them lands to settle south of the Wall
They wont kneel for you and neither will I
I dont want them to kneel for me I want them to fight with me when the time comes
The day I ask my people to fight with the crows is the day my people cut my guts from my belly and make me eat them
And how many of your people cant fight The women the children the old the sick what happens to them Youre condemning them to death Worse than death because youre too proud to make peace Or maybe youre not proud Maybe youre just a coward
Easy thing to say to a man in chains
Your people need a leader And they need to get south of the Wall before its too late We dont have much time and they have less The walkers are coming and theyll hit your people first Im not asking you to make peace to save your skin Make peace to save your people
Most of them are at Hardhome You know where that is
Up on Storrolds Point I can give you 10 horses and nine other men You can get there in a week
Well need ships
Ill talk to King Stannis about lending you his fleet
All right then Youre coming with me Youre the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch They need to hear it from you They need to know the ships they are boarding wont be torched in the middle of the sea You come with me or I dont go
Youd bring wildlings here through our gates
Men women and children will die by the thousands if we do nothing
Let them die We got our own to worry about Less enemies for us
Fewer
What
Nothing
There is good farmland in the Gift Land that no one uses now A dozen abandoned villages
And why do you think the farmers abandoned those villages Because the wildlings raided them for years Cut them down Just like they did this boys people
Weve been fighting them all for thousands of years Theyve slaughtered villages Theyve slaughtered our brothers
And weve slaughtered theirs
I will follow you anywhere you know that But they killed Grenn And they killed Pyp They killed 50 of our brothers I cant forget that I cant forgive it
You were at the Fist of the First Men If we abandon them you know what they become We can learn to live with the wildlings or we can add them to the army of the dead Whatever they are now theyre better than that
Thank you Olly If you have something you want to say to me say it Its all right
You dont mean it do you Telling the wildlings you want to make peace Youre just doing it to trick them
Its not a trick
They burned my village They put an arrow through my fathers head right in front of me They butchered my mother everyone I ever knew
I know what its like to lose the people you love I know this is hard for you But winter is coming We know whats coming with it We cant face it alone
Will there be anything else you need Lord Commander
No
Shes far away from the Lannisters This is her home Maybe Lady Sansa is better off here
Better off with the Boltons who murdered her mother and brother Sansas in danger even if she doesnt realize it
Thank you Youve lived here a long time
Aye
Did you know Lord Eddard
I knew him and his father before him The Starks are gone now
Not all of them I know whos inside that castle
Everyone knows The Boltons
Im not talking about the Boltons I need to get a message to her To Sansa Stark
Who are you
Someone who swore to keep her safe
Swore to who
Her mother
Her mothers dead
That doesnt release me from an oath I served Lady Catelyn I serve her still Who do you serve
Come back here Myranda
I saw you staring at her
Im going to marry her That will involve looking at her from time to time
You said youd marry me
And I meant it When I was a bastard named Snow But Im a Bolton now What I want is no longer the primary consideration Im furthering a dynasty
Do you think shes pretty
Of course I do Im not blind
You think shes pretty too Im looking forward to our wedding night But dont worry Ill have plenty of time for you
Perhaps Ill marry too
Youre the kennel masters daughter Who are you going to marry the stable keepers son Youre mine Youre not going anywhere Unless I have to listen to more of your jealousy Jealousy bores me You remember what happens to people who bore me Youre not going to bore me are you Myranda
Never
Beg pardon my lady Ive come to refill the wash basin
Oh I dont need
You still have friends in the North If youre ever in trouble light a candle in the highest window of the broken tower

Thank you
Its good that she taught you It was a gift Now every time you wear something you made you can remember her
Id rather have a mother
I know Its not the same Still its good to remember Remember the way things were I almost forgot Theres something else to help you remember
Down there at the end
What is it
That would spoil the surprise Go ahead its perfectly safe You wont believe it when you see it
Theon

You smell particularly ripe this evening Pour me some wine
Do you have something to tell me
No my lord
Reek
She saw me

My lady we are all a family we northerners Our blood ties go back thousands of years So Id like to drink to our wedding May our happiness spread from Moat Cailin to the Last Hearth
To your wedding
To your wedding
It must be difficult for you being in a strange place
This isnt a strange place This is my home Its the people who are strange
Youre right Very strange More wine please
I heard you two had reunited A fitting place for it I like to imagine that the last time you spoke was in this very room Are you still angry with him after he what he did Dont worry The North remembers I punished him for it Hes not ironborn anymore Not Theon Greyjoy anymore Hes a new man A new person anyway Arent you Reek
Yes master
Thats his new name Reek
Why are you doing this
Because Reek has something to say to you Dont you Reek An apology Apologize to Lady Sansa for what you did Apologize for murdering her two brothers
Im sorry
Look at her Reek An apology doesnt mean anything if youre not looking the person in the eye
Im sorry
Sorry about what
For killing your brothers
There over and done with Doesnt everyone feel better I do That was getting very tense Whew You know what my lady What with him having murdered your brothers and the rest of your family gone Reek here is the nearest thing to living kin that you have left Reek You will give away the bride Someone has to What better person Good Good
Yes yes very good
Wonderful
Walda and I have some good news as well since were all together
Were going to have a baby
Im very happy for you
From the way shes carrying Maester Wolkan says it looks like a boy
How can you be sure
Sure of what
That shes pregnant I mean how can you tell
Maester Wolkan has assured us beyond all doubt
So how did you manage it
Manage what
Getting her pregnant
I imagine youre familiar with the procedure
Of course but how did you find it
You disgraced yourself at dinner parading that creature before the Stark girl
And if its a boy
Youre worried about your position
My position is quite clear Im your son until a better alternative comes along
Youve never asked me about your mother
Why would I She had me she died And here we are
She was a peasant girl Pretty in a common sort of way She was the millers wife Apparently they had married without my knowledge or consent So I had him hanged and I took her beneath the tree where he was swaying She fought me the whole time She was lucky I didnt hang her too A year later she came to my gates with a squalling baby in her arms A baby she claimed was mine I nearly had her whipped and the child thrown in the river But then I looked at you and I saw then what I see now You are my son Stannis Baratheon has an army at Castle Black But he wont stay for long He wants the Iron Throne and the road to Kings Landing comes right through Winterfell He means to take the North But the North is ours Its yours and mine Will you help me defeat him
Yes
Is this every book there is
Every book there is
In the world
Well no There are thousands and thousands of books out there This library is rather small actually
Where you grew up were there more books
My fathers not the most literate man They say the Citadel has the largest library in the world
Wheres that
The Citadel In Oldtown
Im sorry I dont know things
Gilly look at me You know how to do a hundred things I can never do You can build a fire with wet wood You can cook You can stitch a wound
I can wash the linens I can sweep the floor
Well
Why does the Citadel have the biggest library
Its where they train the maesters
Like Maester Aemon
I wanted to be one when I was young Instead I became a man of the Nights Watch Far more adventure up here anyway I wouldnt have met you
Ah Your Grace
Youre Samwell Tarly
I am Your Grace
Your father is Randyll Tarly He defeated my brother at the Battle of Ashford Only battle Robert ever lost I told him he shouldnt go so far west so soon but he never listened Fine soldier your father You dont look like a soldier But Im told you killed a white walker
I did Your Grace
How
With a dagger made of dragonglass
Dragonglass
What the maesters call obsidian
I know what it is We have it in Dragonstone Why would obsidian kill a walker
I dont know Ive been going through all the old manuscripts hoping to find something and all Ive learned is that the children of the forest used to hunt with dragonglass
The Lady Melisandre told me that death marches on the Wall
Ive seen it Your Grace
Seen what
The army of the dead And when they come
We have to know how to fight them Keep reading Samwell Tarly
Its time
Uh Your Grace Wouldnt it be better to wait When Jon Snow returns with the wildlings we could have thousands more men
If Jon Snow returns with the wildlings We cant wait that long We have the advantage more men more horses all fed and rested But every day we wait the odds shift in Boltons favor This could turn to winter at any moment We have to act now Give the order We march at sunrise
Ill choose a dozen men to stay and guard the queen and the princess
No need theyre coming with us
Its a tough road ahead Your Grace Wont they be safer
Here Half these watchmen are killers and rapists No they march with us
As you wish Your Grace
Do you think Father will let me go down into the crypt
Beg your pardon
At Winterfell All the Kings in the North are buried there Bran the Builder and King Dorren and
First things first Its a long march ahead And then we have to take the castle
Is there going to be a battle
Aye princess but you wont be anywhere near
Thats enough talk of battle Ser Davos Youll scare the child
Yes my queen
Im not scared
Well I am When the battle comes promise youll protect me
I promise
I hope you know what youre doing with these wildlings I need those ships
Youll get them back I swear it Have a safe journey Your Grace And thank you
Youre still too weak
How long have I been here
Three days
Ser Barristan
I failed him I failed my men I failed my queen
You failed no one You fought bravely Youll fight again Are you ashamed You were ambushed outnumbered There was no way you could have known
This is not why Wounded in war there is no shame for this I am ashamed because when the knife go in and I fall to the ground I am afraid
All men fear death
No not death I fear I never again see Missandei from the Island of Naath
Now you have given the Masters what they deserve
If I give everyone what they deserve Ill have no one left to rule Ser Barristan counseled mercy when I took this city right up to the morning he died Daario Naharis thinks I should kill the former Masters and let the rest of the city fend for itself What do you think
Your Grace I think that I am not fit to have an opinion on these matters
You are as fit as anyone I know You know why Im here And you know who will suffer the most if this all falls apart So what do you think
I can only tell you what I have seen Your Grace I have seen you listen to your counselors I have seen you lean on their experience when your own was lacking and weigh the choices they put before you And I have seen you ignore your counselors because there was a better choice One that only you could see
My my queen please do not do this
What about Valar Morghulis 
I did not want to die a coward Apparently I do not want to die at all
It takes courage to admit fear And to admit a mistake I came here to tell you that I was wrong I was wrong and you were right About tradition About bringing the people of this city together I will reopen the fighting pits To free men only Slavery will never return to Meereen not while I live
Yes my queen
And in order to forge a lasting bond with the Meereenese people I will marry the leader of an ancient family Thankfully a suitor is already on his knees
Dont worry Ill be fine Nothing broken I dont think Where are we now Not the Rhoyne Long sullen silences and an occasional punch in the face The Mormont way Lets start over I apologize for before My mouth sometimes runs away from me This doesnt have to be an unpleasant trip Were going to be spending a lot of time together on the way to Meereen
We are
What would make our time together truly enjoyable would be some wine
No wine
I am a person who drinks People who drink need to keep drinking Otherwise theyre not
I know where we are Youre taking us through Valyria
I am
Have you sailed this route before
No
Youre going to bring Daenerys a souvenir from her ancestral homeland in case Im not enough
I think youll be plenty
You know what they say The Doom still rules Valyria What about the demons and the flames Arent you afraid of the Doom
No But the pirates are
Oh
The Smoking Sea How many centuries before we learn how to build cities like this again Thousands of years the Valyrians were the best in the world at almost everything And then
And then they werent
And then they werent They held each other close and turned their backs upon the end The hills that split asunder and the black that ate the skies The flames that shot so high and hot that even dragons burned Would never be the final sights that fell upon their eyes A fly upon a wall the waves the sea wind whipped and churned 
The city of a thousand years and all that men had learned The Doom consumed it all alike and neither of them turned
I would clap
I suppose this is it then This is what remains
What was that
Stone Men Dont let them touch you
Get behind
Mormont cut me free Mormont
Mormont Mormont
Tyrion Tyrion Tyrion Tyrion Youre all right
Youre heavier than you look Did any of them touch you
You Ive seen greyscale before but nothing like that
I suppose thats why they send them there
Itd be kinder to put daggers in their hearts and be done with it Thank you for saving me Of course I wouldnt have needed saving if you hadnt kidnapped me in the first place So what now
We walk up the coast With luck well find a fishing village Maybe another boat
Without luck
Weve got a long walk ahead of us Ill get some wood for a fire Try to get some rest huh
What are they doing with the bodies
Get back to work
No Ive been here for weeks Im not scrubbing one more corpse until you tell me why Im doing it
You will know why
When
When its time Not before Get back to work
When do I get to play the game
Game
The game The game of faces
You tried already You failed
I didnt even know I was playing
Who are you
No one
Get back to work
Well who are you What are you doing here Howd you get here
Im from Westeros Just like you Daughter of a Lord Just like you Except I was an only child Heir to his fortune My mother died My father remarried and his new wife gave birth to a girl My stepmother didnt want any rivals for her precious daughter so she tried to kill me with poison I found out sought help from the Faceless Men and my father was widowed again Ive been serving them ever since
Was that true or a lie
What
Did you believe every word I said
Get back to work
Who are you
Who are you
Arya
And where did you come from
Westeros My family home is Winterfell Im the youngest daughter of a great lord Eddard Stark He died in battle
A lie
After he was executed I fled the capital Had to kill a stable boy Drove my sword through his back
A lie
I stabbed him in the gut I tried to find my mother and brother I never did They were murdered by Walder Frey An outlaw kidnapped me A man called Polliver
A lie
A man called the Hound Sandor Clegane He tried to sell me but was wounded in a fight He begged me to kill him but I wouldnt I left him in the mountains to die I wanted him to suffer I hated him
I hated him
I hated him
Thats not a lie
The girl lies To me To the Many Faced God To herself Does she truly want to be no one
Yes
Im not playing this stupid game anymore
We never stop playing
So those villages we were supposed to find We cant live on berries and roots
I can
Youre not hungry
Of course Im hungry
Youre an awful travelling companion do you know that Possibly the least charming man I have ever met
I am not your travelling companion
We are travelling together In each others company Therefore
Do you ever shut up
I sailed from Kings Landing to Pentos in a crate Without ever saying a word
Why
Never occurred to you to ask why until now You never wondered why Tyrion Lannister decided to visit a brothel in Volantis
Im sure youve visited many brothels in many cities
I killed my father He wanted to execute me for a crime I didnt commit And he was fucking the woman I loved
As miserable as you are Mormont at least your father was a good man
What do you know about my father
I met him I visited the Wall When I asked him about his men he knew all the stories every one of them He actually cared about the people in his command How did they put it in the Watch We shall never see his like again
You didnt know Im sorry I am
How
I only know what I heard
How
He was leading an expedition beyond the wall There was a mutiny He was murdered by his own men
We better keep moving
Valar morghulis
Valar dohaeris
I have nowhere else to go Ive taken her to every healer in Braavos Ive spent every penny I had She suffers every day of her life I just want it to end
It hurts
I know Dont be afraid I used to be like you I was sick I was dying But my father never gave up on me He loved me More than anything in the world just like your father loves you So he brought me here My father prayed to the many faced god And I drank the water from this fountain It healed me
Ive devoted my life to him now You dont want to hurt anymore Drink
Is the girl ready to give up her ears her nose her tongue her hopes and dreams her loves and hates all that makes a girl who she is forever
No The girl is not ready to become no one But she is ready to become someone else
Why Daenerys Why is she worth all this As I recall the Mormonts fought against the Targaryens during Roberts Rebellion
Do you believe in anything
I believe in many things
In something greater than ourselves I mean The Gods Destiny Do you believe theres a plan for this world
No
Neither did I I was a cynic just like you Then I saw a girl step into a great fire with three stone eggs When the fire burned out I thought Id find her blackened bones Instead I found her Daenerys Alive and unhurt Holding her baby dragons Have you ever heard baby dragons singing
No
Its hard to be a cynic after that
Doesnt mean shes going to be a great queen
No it doesnt
The Targaryens are famously insane What if she conquers the world Then what 1000 years of peace and prosperity
First we have to conquer the world
We Alright lets assume your dreams come true Shes ecstatic when you bring her this enemy dwarf She hacks off my head and restores your position You command her army sail to Westeros defeat all your enemies then watch as she climbs those steps and sits on the Iron Throne Hurrah long live the Queen Then what
Then she rules
So a woman who has not spent a single day of her adult life in Westeros becomes the ruler of Westeros Thats justice
She is the rightful heir
Why because her father who burned living men for amusement was the king
Shh Its a slave ship
Why is it anchored
They probably came ashore for
water
Got a lot of fight in you huh
Salt mines
That or a galley slave He looks strong enough
What about the dwarf
Worthless Cut his throat
Wait wait Wait wait wait lets discuss this
And then chop off his cock We can sell it for a fortune A dwarfs cock has magic powers
Wait wait wait wait You cant just hand a dried cock to a merchant and expect him to pay for it He has to know it came from a dwarf And how could he know unless he sees the dwarf
It will be a dwarfsized cock
Guess again
The dwarf lives until we find a cock merchant
Queen Daenerys has outlawed slavery
Were bound to Volantis not Slavers Bay Besides she reopened the fighting pits I never heard of free men fighting in the pits
The fighting puts in Mereen Youre in luck then youre about to be rich You are looking at one of the great warriors in the seven kingdoms
Him
Him Hes got to be 60 years old
Sure hes a bit long in the tooth a bit withered been in the sun too long We can all see that But he is a veteran of 100 battles They wrote songs about him
Is that true
He won the tournament at Lannisport unseating Ser Jaime Lannister himself
ingslayer
Jousting Youre talking about jousting A fancy game for fancy lads The men who fight at Mereen will swallow him whole
I killed a Dothraki blood rider in single combat
Liar
Its no lie His name was Qotho He was bloodrider to Khal Drogo Take me to Slavers Bay put a sword in my hand Ill prove my worth
Lord Baelish
Yes Lancel Lannister
Brother Lancel We abandoned our family names
Thats quite a family to abandon
The city has changed since you were here last We flooded the gutters with wine smashed the false idols and sent the godless on the run
Well done
Im here on urgent business for the Queen Mother Should I send word that Ill be delayed
Step carefully Lord Baelish Youll find that theres little tolerance for flesh peddlers in the new Kings Landing
We both peddle fantasies Brother Lancel Mine just happen to be entertaining
Do you think its wise your Grace arresting the heir to Highgarden
The Faith arrested the heir to Highgarden
Of course And the Faith were armed on your orders
ings orders Is the King to blame for Ser Loras perversion
House Tyrell wont tolerate these insults
House Tyrell wont tolerate it Im the insulted party Lord Baelish Ser Loras was promised to me instead he chose the company of boys
Ones choice of companion is a curious thing
Most curious Lysa Arryn for instance A sorrily repellent woman Forgive me I know youre still in mourning
Lysa was a good woman A kind woman
She was neither of those things we both know it Still I pity her son How fortunate that the young Lord of the Vale has a new father to counsel him
I know how hard it can be to lose both of your parents at such a young age
If war comes to Westeros will the Knights of the Veil fight for their king
Young Lord Robyn heeds my advice And I have always counseled loyalty to the throne
Good If theres nothing else
There is another matter your Grace Something so urgent I couldnt trust the words to a raven You once charged me with finding Arya Stark To my shame I failed you But I have found Sansa Stark Alive and well and home again In Winterfell
Thats not possible
My sources are well placed They tell me Roose Bolton plans to marry her to his son Ramsay a bastard recently legitimized by King Tommen
Roose Bolton is Warden of the North by the grace of my father
Indeed As reward for stabbing his own king in the heart
We were fools to trust a turncloak
Marrying his son to the last of the Starks gives him more legitimacy in the North than an alliance with a hated southern house
I will skin him and his bastard like that wretch on that bloody sigil
I would counsel patience your grace
Patience Sansa helped murder my son Roose Bolton is a traitor
Stannis Baratheon is also a traitor marching with his army on Winterfell Let Stannis and Roose battle let the enemies of the throne slaughter each other and when theyre done seize Winterfell from whichever thief survives
Winterfell is 1000 miles away from here The weather has already begun to turn
That is why it is critical to strike soon while the victor still licks his wounds Surely your Uncle Kevan could muster a force
My Uncle Kevan has all the courage of a kitchen mouse
Ser Jaime then
Jaime is away on a sensitive diplomatic mission Ive no idea when hell be back
Perhaps I can help nights of the Vale are some of the best fighters in Westeros trained to battle in the ice and the snow
Forgive me Lord Baelish you have a reputation as a money lender and brothel keeper not a military man
You wouldnt risk a single Lannister soldier or a single coin from the Royal Treasury What do you have to lose a brothel keeper
And if you succeed
Name me Warden of the North
Ill speak to the king this evening Have him issue a royal decree
Ill not rest until the lion flies over Winterfell
And Ill l know youre a man of your word when I see Sansa Starks head on a spike
As I said I live to serve
Im going to ask him tomorrow
What if he says no
He wont Youve waited long enough I want you to be my wife now What is it
Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it or do you
We cant Not yet
Why not
You know why not Someone will see
You are going to be my wife I am going to be your husband We are allowed to walk through the gardens together
How many other girls have you walked through these gardens
I like the way your eyes go squinty when youre jealous
They dont go squinty and you didnt answer the question
They make a lovely couple A Lannister and a Martell They have no idea how dangerous that is We must protect them
Yes my prince
You have not had to use that axe of yours in a very long time I hope you remember how
I remember how
The Dornishmans wife was as fair as the sun and her kisses were warmer than spring The Dornishmans blade it was made of black steel and its kiss was a terrible thing The Dornishmans wife would sing as she bathed in a voice that was sweet as a peach
Alright thats enough
Im coming to the best part
Were trying to blend in We dont want everyone in Dorne to hear your accent
This song really is all about the ending
It can wait Up there
Thats the Water Gardens
Once we got the princess then what
I like to improvise
That explains the golden hand
Unbowed unbent unbroken For Oberyn
For Oberyn
Well shes made herself at home
Myrcella
Uncle Jaime I dont understand what are you doing here
Lets speak in private
I am Trystane Martell
Trystane is my intended
Excellent Good to meet you
We werent expecting you Ser Jaime
Why dont you let them have some time alone son
Lets not do something stupid
No
That was something stupid
We have to go Myrcella now
You hurt him
Youll be fine I promise but we have to
Oh for fucks sake
Youre coming with me
I dont want to
I wasnt asking princess
Drop you weapons
I am Obara Sand Daughter of Oberyn Martell I fight for Dorne Who do you fight for
Drop your weapons
When you were whole it would have been a good fight
You fight pretty good for a little girl
Halt
Oh You can smell the shit from 5 miles away Well why are we stopped go on
Rumors and gossip thats all they got Its theater nothing more If they arrested all the pillow biters in Kings Landing thered be no room left in the dungeons for anyone else
Everyone knew about him and Renly
Renly Baratheon shagged half the stable boys in the Seven Kingdoms Everyone knew No one cared
But he was the kings brother
And Loras is the queens brother No no no no this is unacceptable
Cersei is behind this
Of course she is She wants to drag our names through the dirt Put us in our place Get some rest dear you look appalling Let me deal with Cersei Lannister
Your Grace I have travelled a long way
You must be exhausted
Put the pen down dear we all know you arent writing anything
Ah yes the famously tarttongued queen of thorns
And the famous tart Queen Cersei
Beg your pardon
I know youre behind this absurd incarceration of my grandson
If you apologize for that comment perhaps
Youll get your apology when I get Loras
I was as shocked as anyone when The Faith arrested Ser Loras I have no love for these fanatics But what can the queen mother do
Has the crown suddenly stopped needing the troops gold and wheat my house supplies
I assure you our alliance with House Tyrell remains
Do you expect the alliance to continue after youve thrown our future into prison
As I said i didnt imprison anyone As for your veiled threats
What veil
The LannisterTyrell alliance brought peace to a wartorn country Do you really want to see the Seven Kingdoms slide back into warfare
I didnt trust your father I didnt particularly like him But I respected him He was no fool He understood that sometimes we must work with our rivals rather than destroy them
House Lannister has no rival The High Septon has called for an inquest not a trial Just a small hearing to determine whether the charges against Loras have merit which Im sure they dont Loras will be freed our happy alliance will continue and well forget this unfortunate conversation ever happened Good day Lady Olenna
You are aware of the rumors concerning you and Renly
I dont pay attention to rumors
You were said to be despondent when he died Witnesses said that you refused to leave his bedside even as Stannis
He was my friend He was my king
Wasnt Joffrey your king He was anointed by the 7 not Renly
I was wrong to support Renlys claim I know that But I was forgiven by Joffrey I fought for him at the Battle of the Blackwater
Wearing Renlys armor
Why does it matter what I wore
Do you deny all of the charges against you Fornication buggery blasphemy
Of course I deny them
You never lay with Renly Baratheon
Never
Nor any other man
Never
That will be all Ser Loras
Well I think thats quite enough of that
Faith calls Queen Margaery forward
You call me forward
Yes We have some questions for you
I am the queen
You are And according to Law of the Seven neither kings nor queens are exempt from testimony at a holy inquest
How do you respond to these charges against your brother
They are lies
All of them
All of them
Queen Margaery in the presence of the gods do you swear that your brother is innocent of these charges against him to the best of your knowledge
Yes I swear it
Thank you your grace
Do you know this man
Yes very well He is Ser Loras Tyrell heir to Highgarden
How did you come to meet
I squired for him He took a liking to me He summoned me to his chamber the first day we met
And what occurred in his chamber
We engaged in intimate relations
You laid with him
That night and many others
Liar Hes a liar
Is there anyone else who can support your claim
Yes yes Queen Margaery She walked in on us once not long ago She didnt seem surprised
This testimony is an insult to a great house Why should The Faith or anyone else take the word of a squire over the heir to Highgarden
He has a birthmark your grace Quite high on his thigh winecolored and roughly the shape of Dorne
Liar
What are you doing Let us pass
The Faith is satisfied that there is enough evidence to bring a formal trial for Ser Loras and Queen Margaery
What
Bearing false witness before the gods is as grave a sin as any Take her
Tommen Tommen
You cant do this I am the queen Tommen Tommen I am your queen how dare you
What do you want
Lord Ramsay sent me to draw your bath my lady You want to be clean and fresh for your new husband dont you
Youre so beautiful But if you need to keep him happy Ramsay gets bored easily You dont want to end up like Well like the others
What others
I shouldnt gossip Its good to see the red again No point in hiding anymore
What others
Lets see There was Kiera The blacksmiths daughter She was tall Like you Lovely figure But she talked and talked and talked and Ramsay got tired of that Then there was Violet She had gorgeous blond hair But she got pregnant and well that was boring Then Tamsay Such a sweet girl Of course sweet girls get a bit dull after a while dont they Ramsay let me come with him on that hunt
Hunt
Mm Have you ever seen a body after the dogs have been at it Not so pretty But its your wedding day why am I talking about such things
What was your name again
Myranda
And how long have you loved him Myranda Did you imagine that he would be with you forever is that it Then I came along and ruined it I am Sansa Stark of Winterfell This is my home and you cant frighten me
Are you done with your bath my lady
Go I can finish on my own
Yes

No
Lord Ramsay he said Im to take your arm
Im not touching you
Please Hell punish me
Do you think I care what he does to you
Who comes before the Old Gods this night
Sansa of the House Stark comes here to be wed A woman grown trueborn and noble She comes to beg the blessings of the gods Who comes to claim her
Ramsay of House Bolton Heir to the Dreadfort and Winterfell Who gives her
Theon of House Greyjoy Who was who was her fathers ward
Lady Sansa will you take this man

Are you pleased my lady
Good I want you to be happy My father said youre still a virgin
Yes
Why Why are you still a virgin Afraid of dwarves
Lord Tyrion was kind he was gentle he never touched me
Youre not lying to me
No my lord
Lying to your husband on his wedding night that would be a very bad way to start a marriage We are man and wife now we should be honest with each other dont you think
Yes sir
Good Now take off your clothes
Oh no no no You stay here Reek You watch Do I need to ask a second time I hate asking a second time
Reek I told you to watch
First Ranger you have command of Castle Black
Lord Commander it is my duty to tell you I believe this mission to be reckless foolhardy and an insult to all of the Brothers that have died fighting the wildlings
As always thank you for your honesty
Safe travels Lord Commander
Thank you Sam
Oh and
Its Dragonglass Its what I used to kill the White Walker I hope you dont need them
Me too
There he is That laugh Egg Egg laughed like that One of the first things I remember about him
His little brother Aegon He became king
And before that he was a jolly fellow Like this one
Get him south Gillyflower Before its too late
Theon wait
Not Theon my lady Reek
Help me
Youre his wife now
Do what he says Do what he says or hell hurt you
He already hurts me every night All day Im locked in this room and every night he comes It cant be worse
It can It can always be worse
What did he do to you
Please
You betrayed my family
Im sorry Im sorry
You have to help me
Hell see us You dont know him
My family still has friends in the North All I have to do is give a signal and theyll rescue me Climb to the top of the Broken Tower light this candle and put it in the window Promise me Theon
Reek my lady Reek
Your name is Theon Greyjoy Last surviving son of Balon Greyjoy Lord of the Iron Islands do you hear me Theon Promise me
Yes Reek
Egg Egg Mothers looking for you Egg
Get some sleep Sam Youll have to speak for him tomorrow
You dont know that
Get some sleep Ill watch over him
Ill stay too Hes always been good to me I cant leave him now
Egg Egg I dreamed that I was old
His name was Aemon Targaryen He came to us from Kings Landing a Maester of the Citadel chained and sworn And a sworn brother of the Nights Watch ever faithful No man was wiser or gentler or kinder At the Wall a dozen Lord Commanders came and went during his years of service but he was always there to counsel them He was the blood of the dragon but now his fire has gone out And now his watch has ended
And now his watch has ended
Youre losing all your friends Tarly
My beautiful wife
When my father told me we were marrying I half expected a fat bearded beast Do you know how pleased I was when I saw you Youve made me very happy
Our scouts report that Stannis Baratheon rides for Winterfell Hes a respected commander His troops are loyal and battle tested Hes hired thousands of foreign sell swords to bolster his army But this storm was a stroke of luck for us northerners Our people are used to fighting in frost His armys out there now suffering in the snow One day Ill be Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North Youll be my Lady and Wardeness
But isnt your step mother pregnant
What of it
What happens if she has a boy
Then Ill have a baby brother
But hell be the heir
Im Lord Boltons eldest son
But youre a bastard a true born will always have the stronger claim
Ive been naturalized by a royal decree of
Tommen Baratheon Another bastard
Bastards can rise high in the world Like your halfbrother Jon Snow Born The Bastard of Winterfell now the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch
You didnt know Yes hes done very well for himself Ah I near forgot why I asked you to join me Come my lady
Your Northern friend Reek told me you wanted to leave
Why Winterfell is your home and I am your husband
Tough old bird Everyone talks when I start beating them But this one Her heart gave out before I got to her face We do breed them tough in the North Bring my wife back to her chamber Its far too cold out here for a lady You should hold on to your candles The nights are so long now
40 horses died in the night Well lose more come sunset Were running out of food We cant open the supply line until the snow clears
What else
The Stormcrows rode off last night
500 men
Sell swords loyal to nothing but gold
We still have a hard march to Wintefell and we wont be marching anywhere in this weather
And
This isnt our time we should head back to Castle Black when the snow clears
I retreated from Kings Landing Ser Davos If I retreat again I become ing Who Ran
Your Grace
Winter is coming Those arent just the Stark words its a fact If we march back to Castle Black we winter at Castle Black And who can say how many years this winter will last
Its better to wait for the right time than to risk everything
This is the right time and I will risk everything Because if I dont weve lost We march to victory or we march to defeat but we go forward only forward
Your Grace
Ive trusted in your visions in your prophecies for years
You saw it yourself my king when you stared into the flames A great battle in the snow
I dont know what I saw
You do know Trust yourself
And you do you trust yourself
I trust in the Lord
Are you sure
I have seen myself walk along the battlements of Wintefell I have seen the flayed men banners lowered to the ground
But sometimes sacrifices must be made to ensure victory I have shown you the power of kings blood The Usurper Robb Stark The Usurper Joffrey Baratheon
We dont have Roberts bastard here
No we have someone better and your blood runs through her veins
Have you lost your mind
Do you doubt me still After all that youve seen
There must be another way Leeches or something
There is only one way You must become king before the Long Night begins Only you can lead the living against the dead All your life has led us to this moment To this decision
Shes my daughter
Get out
The beauty from beyond The Wall
Where are you going huh Arent we better looking than the fat man
The question is is she pretty down south in the real world or is she pretty because shes the only girl here
Even in White Harbor Id want a kiss
Come on love give us a kiss
Leave me alone
If you were my girl I wouldnt leave you alone
One little kiss
Come on give him a kiss
A man gets lonely guarding the Wall
Theres no need to be rude
We just want a little affection
Get your hands off her Brother Derryk Brother Brand I believe you both have guard duty tonight
Sam the Slayer Are you gonna slay me with that sword
Look at his hands shaking
Gilly go on Get back to your room and lock the door
Im warning you
Come on Come on
You lying sack of shit Killed a White Walker eh You fatass fuck Come on get up Hes your hero Hes a hog
Leave him alone
Stubborn little wilding bitch arent ya
Sam Sam Sam
Alright Hold still
I said get your hands off her
Youre gonna get yourself killed
Roll over Jon Snows not here to save you
I killed a White Walker I killed a Thenn Ill take my chances with you
Sam
Im alright
Youre not
Just a bit woozy
The next time you see something like that you leave it alone
I will not They wouldve I dont know what they would have done
I know they would have killed you if Ghost hadnt come
No They were tiring out I had them in the palm of my hand
Dont be stupid Sam youre not a fighter
What kind of man would I be if I ran away when I saw someone hurting you
Just promise me that whatever happens youll take care of little Sam
Of course I will And Ill take care of you too
I need more water
Stay Please
Am I hurting you
Are you sure
Oh Oh my
A rare find for the fighting pits my friends Not your usual street tough old drunken pirate This ones a Westerosi knight from an ancient house trained in sword and lance he fought beside the Stag King Robert on the far side of the Narrow Sea He was first from the breach during the siege of Pyke slaughtering 50 men with his flaming sword He killed the great Khal Drogo in single combat Betrayed by his woman he sold himself into slavery to repay his debts Bidding begins at 12 gold honors
13 Do I have 14
15 15 golds honors Do I have 16
20
Sold
Wait You have to buy me as well
Why
Were a team Im a great fighter too
Hes funny You have to give him that
Alright Hes funny
Thank you my Lord Thank you
Yes
My Lord if I may Ive heard Mereens become a free city You might run into trouble if you try to fight slaves in the fighting pits Now if you were to fight free men who were paid a wage
Heres your wages funny man Itll last the rest of your life
How long before the king of Mereen comes to claim my pillow
Dont be ridiculous My marriage to Hizdahr is political I think hes smart enough to understand that
I think the Sons of the Harpy have stopped killing because their leader was made king
Are you jealous
Do you think Im petty enough to speak ill of a man just because he represents competition
I do
Youre right My motivations are entirely impure
Doesnt make me wrong
You told me yourself I cant fight enemies within and without So when enemies from without come knocking I need the city of Mereen behind me I have no choice
Everyone has a choice Even slaves have a choice Death or slavery
So what else can I do
Marry me instead
Even if I wanted to do such an inadviseable thing I couldnt
Why not Youre our queen you can do as you like
No I can
Then you are the only person in Mereen whos not free
I know Im here to serve my queen and not to give advice but can I make one more suggestion
Of course
On the day of the Great Games gather all the great masters and wise masters and worthy masters you can find and slaughter them all
I am a queen Not a butcher
All rulers are either butchers or meat
You there Where would I find the High Septon or High Sparrow or whatever bloody fool name hes got
Its not as good a name as Queen of Thorns Ill admit
You should have the decency to stand when you talk to a lady
You should have the decency to kneel before the gods
Dont spar with me little fellow
For me its the knees You
Hips
Huh
A man of the people is that your game Its an old game dull and unconvincing A man of the people who does Cerseis dirty work for her
The people always do the dirty work
Spare me the homilies I can smell a fraud from a mile away
A useful talent
Im here for my grandson and granddaughter
Your grandson and granddaughter swore sacred vows and lied The Father judges us all Sons of high lords sons of fishermen If you break his laws you will be punished
Dont you walk away from me
You dont give commands here Lady Olenna
What is it you want Gold Ill make you the richest septon who ever lived
What then
I imagine this is strange for you Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on slitting in and out But Im telling you a simple truth I serve the gods The gods demand justice
How do they communicate their demands By raven or horse
By the holy text The seven pointed star If you dont have one in your library Ill give you my own
Ive read the seven pointed star
Then youll remember the passages concerning buggery and perjury Your grandchildren will be punished in the same manner as anyone who breaks the sacred laws
Half the men women and children in this foul city break the sacred laws You live among murderers thieves and rapists And yet you punish Loras for shagging and Margaery for defending her brother
Yes The Gods laws must be applied to all equally
If its equality you want then so be it When House Tyrell stops sending our crops to the capital everyone here will starve And Ill make sure the hungry know who to blame
Have you ever served the field Lady Olenna Have you ever reaped the grain Has anyone in House Tyrell A lifetime of wealth and power has left you blind in one eye You are the few We are the many And when the many stop fearing the few
Lady Olenna
Starving yourself wont make things any better for her my love
Shes in a prison cell and theres nothing I can do I am the king The queen is in prison and theres nothing I can do
No matter who you are no matter how strong you are sooner or later youll face circumstances beyond your control Events you couldnt possibly have anticipated or prevented even if you had You cannot blame yourself for fate Your father your brother your grandfather I was Queen of the Seven Kingdoms and what could I do Hold them as they left this world Kissed their heads after theyd gone
Ill call in the army Ill take back the sept and kill every last one of them Ill start a war if I have to
You know as well as I do who the first casualty in that war would be
I love her I love her I cant help her
We must be strong for those we love We cannot give in to despair
I will speak to the high sparrow There must be something
Let me speak to him on your behalf The king cannot dirty sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic
Your happiness is all I want in this world
I know
No you dont You cant possibly Not until you have children of your own I would do anything for you Anything to keep you from harm I would burn cities to the ground That is all that matters You and your sister From the moment you came into this world my boy My only boy
Prince Doran hopes this satisfies your concerns about the princesss wellbeing
You looked different when I left You had more hair
And more hands Hows Trystane
Hell be alright
Im sorry for that It wasnt supposed to happen that way
Why is it happening at all
Your mothers worried about you Threats have been made Dorne is too dangerous for you Ive come to take you home
This is my home this has been my home for years I didnt want to come here but she told me to I did what she said I did my duty and now shes forcing me to go back
Its for your own good These are complicated matters
Its not complicated at all its simple I love Trystane Im going to marry him and were staying right here
I dont understand
Of course you dont You dont know me
Brothers oh brothers my days here are done the Dornishmans taken my life Bur what does it matter for all men must die and Ive tasted the Dornishmans wife Yes Ive tasted the Dornishmans wife
Hes got a good voice
Were lucky hes a singer If he were a fighter we might have been in trouble
Its against my code to hurt a woman
Its amazing how many men we beat seem to have this code
I wouldnt say you beat me
Hows your arm
Wonderful Wouldnt feel right to leave Dorne without a new scar
You think youre leaving Dorne
No great hurry Dornish women are the most beautiful women in the world
Thank you
I said Dornish women I didnt say you
Im not the most beautiful woman youve ever seen
Ive seen quite a few women in all the Seven Kingdoms
Name one more beautiful than I am
Well now in Kings Landing there was an absolutely gorgeous
There was a what In Kings Landing you were saying
Was I
There was a woman more beautiful than I am
Was there My memorys not what it was earlier
Hows your arm now
You seem concerned with it You must really like me
And how about your head
My head You dont even wanna know whats going on in
Your nose is bleeding
Its nothing Its the dry air
My dagger was coated with a special ointment from Asshei They call it the Long Farewell It takes time to work but if a single drop makes contact with the skin death
The only antidote Whos the most beautiful woman in the world
Sorry Who
You
Dont drop it
I think youre very handsome as well
Im sorry about the locale
No youre not
It felt like the safest place
Not for your clientele clearly
It was an establishment like no other The sheer range of appetites catered to desires that didnt exist until we invented them
Youve always been rather impressed with yourself havent you
The past is the past The future is all thats worth discussing The future of House Tyrell
Dont pretend to have any concern for my house my grandchildren or me I should have known youd return to the capital once things started going wrong
I promise you
I promise you Lord Baelish that our fates are joined Together we murdered a king And if my house should fall I would have nothing to hide And if i should meet with some accident here at this broken little flesh market theyll never even find whats left of you So do you deny a part in all of this
Cersei summoned me to Kings Landing I dared not refuse her
And what did she want
A piece of info that she know that I had Neither silence nor lies were an option But I have other information of which she is unaware And as you say our interests are aligned I have a gift for you
What kind of gift
The same kind I gave Cersei A handsome young man
Many worthy fighters have died trying to make it to the Great Games When most of you worthless scum join them in death this afternoon it will represent a significant rise in your station But if you happen to triumph here you will fight at the great pit of Daznak itself in front of the queen So whatever happens the gods have smiled upon you today Today is the day your lives actually start to mean something
You and you you you two you you and you
Valar morghulis
Valar dohaeris
Prepare yourselves
Sitting through the great games will be bad enough
For generations in the days leading up to the great games it has been customary for our ruler to make the rounds to the lower pits to pay the fighters there the honor of her presence
Move yourselves
Your Grace Your Future Grace You honor us all
We fight and die for your glory O glorious queen
We fight and die for your glory O glorious queen
I think Ive seen enough
Your Grace its a tradition for the queen to stay until the victor has emerged
Ive sacrificed more than enough for your traditions
What are you doing
Get him out of my sight
Khaleesi please I just need a moment of your time I brought you a gift
Its true He has
Who are you
I am the gift Its a pleasure to meet you Your Grace My name is Tyrion Lannister
This is horrible Unacceptable Are they feeding you enough at least I brought you this Venison Its quite good I had it myself for supper only last night We did everything we could from the moment they took your brother Tommen even went to the sept himself to confront the high sparrow but I fear The Faith has left reason behind
I know you did this
We are making every effort on your behalf I swear to you by all the seven gods
Lies come easily to you Everyone knows that But innocence decency concern Youre not very good at those Im afraid Perhaps thats why your son was so eager to cast you aside for me
Youre upset Youre not thinking clearly Ill visit again when youve had a chance to calm down
I dont want to see you again
I do hope you change your mind about that Ive been told men often go mad in the Black Cells below the Red Keep but I suppose your isolation will end once your trial begins
Leave
Yes Im afraid I must My son needs me now more than ever
Get out you hateful bitch
Sleep well sister
Thank you You saw her
Yes
And
Her accommodations seem sufficient What happens to her now
Well she and her brother are both being held under fair suspicion A trial will be held for each of them to determine if they are guilty of any acts that might constitute a violation of the tenants of the faith
Who will stand judge
Seven septons As it was in all trials before the Targaryens
Will you be one of them
I will
If one or both of them were to confess before the trial
Then they will be at The Mothers mercy
What does The Mothers mercy entail
It depends on the situation The acts themselves the degree of contrition
Thank you High Septon for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven
Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in Kings Landing
I think I may have heard at one point
Baelor built his sept around it But men worshipped here long before him
Who carved this altar do you know
Im afraid i dont
No one does Theres no name on it Or anywhere else in the chapel The people who built this place didnt inflict their vanity on the people who came after them The way Baelor did with that great gilded monstrosity out there Their faith was clean Strip away the gold and the ornaments knock down the statues and the pillars and this is what remains Something simple solid and true The Tyrells finery will be stripped away Their lives knocked down their true hearts laid bare for all to see And so it will be for all of us high and low alike What will we find when we strip away your finery
A young man came to us not long ago broken in body and spirit He had so much to strip away so much weighing him down But piece by piece he unburdened himself Let go of vanity pride sin now his soul is so light he will float through the Seven Heaves like a bird
And he has much to say about you
Move Let me go immediately
You will order her to let me go I am the queen I am the queen Have you lost your mind Let me go You filthy I am the queen Let me go
Your Grace I want to say
You will not speak How do I know you are who you say you are
If only I were otherwise
If you are Tyrion Lannister why shouldnt I kill you To pay your family back for what it did to mine
You want revenge against the Lannisters I killed my mother Joanna Lannister the day I was born I killed my father Tywin Lannister with a bow to the heart I am the greatest Lannister killer of our time
So I should welcome you into my service because you murdered members of your own family
Into your service Your Grace we have only just met Its too soon to know if you deserve my service
If youd rather return to the fighting pits just say the word
When I was a young man I heard a story about a baby born during the worst storm in living memory She had no wealth no lands no army only a name and a handful of supporters most of whom probably thought they could use that name to benefit themselves They kept her alive moving her from place to place often hours ahead of the men who had been sent to kill her She was eventually sold off to some warlord on the edge of the world and that appeared to be that And then a few years later the most well informed person I knew told me that this girl without wealth lands or armies had somehow acquired all 3 in a very short span of time along with three dragons He thought she was our best last chance to build a better world I thought you were worth meeting at the very least
And why are you worth meeting Why should I spend my time listening to you
Because you can not build a better world on your own You have no one at your side who understands that land you want to rule The strengths and the weaknesses of the houses that will either support or oppose you
I have a very large army and very large dragons
Killing and politics arent always the same thing When I served as Hand of the King I did quite well with the latter considering the king in question preferred torturing animals to leading his people I could do an even better job advising a ruler worth the name
So you want to advise me Very well What would you have me do with him I swore I would kill him if he ever returned
I know
Why should the people trust a queen who cant keep her promises
Whomever Ser Jorah was when he started informing on you he is no longer that man I cant remember seeing the same man as devoted to anything as he is to serving you He claims he would kill for you and die for you and nothing I have witnessed gives me reason to doubt him And yet he did betray you
Did he have an opportunity to confess his betrayals
Yes many opportunities
And did he
No Not until forced to do so
He worships you He is in love with you I think But he did not trust you with the truth an unpleasant truth to be sure but one of great significance to you He did not trust that you would be wise enough to forgive him
So I should kill him
A ruler who kills those that are devoted to her is not a ruler that inspires devotion And youre going to need to inspire devotion and lots of it if youre ever going to rule across the Narrow Sea But you cannot have him by your side when you do
Remove Ser Jorah from the city
Confess
My son Let me speak to
Confess I meant it
My face will be the last thing you see before
My name is Lana Im an orphan When I was 8 I begged enough money to buy my first bucket of oysters and I sold that bucket and made enough money to buy 2 more
Iit took a while but I finally saved enough to buy myself an oyster cart Now every morning I make my way down to the canals I pass the fish mongers and the bakers I usually see Lhara my first customer of the day on my way home Then I turn left onto Moonsinger Lane
Left onto Ragman Lane where I do most of my trade
Lana is very impressive Very industrious She will make a fine servant for the Many Faced God
How will she serve him
She will no longer turn left onto Ragman Lane She will turn right and go to Ragman Harbor
What will she do there
She will see
See what
How can a man tell a girl this If he knew what she would see there would be no reason to send her
Oysters clams and cockles
Oysters clams and cockles Oysters clams and cockles
Your oysters fresh
Best in the city
You wouldnt lie to an old man would you
Very nice Give me 4 With vinegar
Its my 18th voyage Ive returned from all of them without a scratch on me
Cant do it
Please I have 3 children Without me here take it you have to I have 3 children what will they do Please you have to Please You dont understand
The man is a gambler He wages that his sailors ship will make it to its destination It is a strange wager for the captain He only wins if he loses his life
So why would a captain make the wager in the first place
A girl tells a man that she has seen
If the captain dies the thin man pays his family a lot of money
But perhaps the gambler loses his bet and decides that he doesnt have to pay after all A destitute woman and her small child what can they do to such a man if he keeps their money for himself To whom can they turn for recourse
The Many Faced God You said you didnt know what I would see at the docks
A man had no idea what she would see and what she would not A girl named Lana will return to the docks She will watch the gambler She will come to know as much about him as she knows about herself
And then what
A gift for the Thin Man
She is not ready
Perhaps she is perhaps shes not
And if shes not
It is all the same to the Many Faced God
The trial will take place The High Sparrow will be presenting a substantial case against you
The charges
Fornication treason incest the murder of King Robert
All lies
Of course Your Grace My concern is that The Faith does not adhere to the same standards of proof as the crown And I hope youll excuse me for saying it but belief is so often the death of reason
I wish youd said it sooner Any word from Jaime
Im afraid not Your Grace Grand Maester Pycelle has summoned your Uncle Kevan back from Casterly Rock to serve as Hand of the King He now presides over the small council
Tell him I need to speak to him
I implored him to visit you but he would not
What about my son the king If you can visit me then surely the king
Your arrest and Queen Margaerys arrest the king has not taken well He remains in his chambers his servants often find his food in the hall Left untouched
You need to talk to him you need to talk to my son to come and see me come and see his mother
I tried my grace he wouldnt see me He wouldnt see anyone
I cant stay here
There is a way Your Grace A way out
Confess To the High Sparrow I wont I made him I rose him up from nothing I will not kneel before some barefooted commoner and beg his forgiveness
Goodbye my queen The work continues
Why Why Theon
Not Theon There is no Theon Reek
Reek Why did you tell him Reek
I was helping you You were trying to escape there is no escape Not ever Theon Greyjoy tried to escape The master knew He knows everything He hunted him he caught him he strapped him to a cross and cut away piece after piece until there was no Theon left
Good If it werent for you Id still have a family If I could do to you what Ramsay did to you right here right now I would
I deserved everything I deserve to be Reek I did terrible things Turned on Robb Captured Winterfell Killed those boys
They werent those boys they were Bran and Rickon They were your brothers youd know them since they were born
They werent They were only
Only what
I cant
Tell me
I cant not unless the master says
Tell me they werent what
They werent SANSA Tell me why Bran and Rickon should be dead while you still breathe the air Tell me to my face Theon tell me that they werent your brothers
They werent Bran and Rickon I couldnt find them It was two farm boys I killed them and burned them so no one would know
You didnt 
Do you know where they went Bran and Rickon
I cant talk to you anymore
Theon you have to tell me do you have any idea where Bran and Rickon
Not Theon Reek
Our scouts tells us hes got no more than 6000 men More than half of them are mounted however
And how high can Stannis horses jump Our walls have been full repaired our walls have been reinforced We have enough food for six months We are more prepared for a siege than they could have ever been All we have to do is wait for them to freeze starve and mutiny
You disagree
Stannis isnt from the North You are father I think youre missing an opportunity to show the people of the North how House Bolton treats southern invaders
And what do you recommend
That we not sit and wait to let Stannis to decide what type of fight this is going to be That we hit first and hit hard and leave a feast for the crows
A smart commander does not surrender a defensive advantage As long as we stay behind these walls they cant touch us Not to mention that the snow is so deep that we couldnt get an army through if we wanted to
I dont need an army I need 20 good men
So have you decided yet Whether Im worthy of your service
Have you decided yet whether youre going to have me killed
Its probably my safest option
I can see why you would think so Its what your father would have done
And what would your father do
My father Who publicly sentenced me to death Id say his thoughts on having me killed were abundantly clear
Is that why you killed him
Some day if you decide not to execute me Ill tell you all about why I killed my father And on that day should it ever come well need more wine than this
I know what my father was What he did I know the Mad King earned his name
So here we sit two terrible children of two terrible fathers
Im terrible
Ive heard stories
Why did you travel to the other side of the world to meet someone terrible
To see if you were the right kind of terrible
Which kind is that
The kind that prevents your people from being even more so
I did reopen the fighting pits Under my rule murder will once again become entertainment
Yes that was wise And you agreed to marry someone you loathed for the greater good Very impressive My own sister married someone she loathed as well though not by choice and certainly not for the greater good Gods forbid She ended up having him killed
Perhaps it wont come to that
Its not impossible that Varys was right about you after all
Varys King Roberts spy master
Yes He was the one who convinced me to come find you He was my travelling companion before Ser Jorah seized that role for himself
Jorah sent my secrets to Varys For 20 years the spider oversaw the campaign to find and kill me
He did what he had to do to survive He did a lot of other things that he didnt have to do I suspect hes the main reason you werent slaughtered in your crib
But you trust him
Yes oddly He might be the only person in the world that I trust Besides my brother
The brother who killed my father
Thats the one
Perhaps I will have you killed after all
Your queenly prerogative I had given up on life until Varys convinced me you might be worth living for You chop off my head Well my final days were interesting
Im not going to kill you
No Banish me
No
So if Im not going to be murdered and Im not going to be banished
Youre going to advise me While you can still speak in complete sentences
Advise you on what
How to get what I want
The Iron Throne Perhaps you should try wanting something else
If I want jokes Ill get myself a proper fool
Im not entirely joking Theres more to the world than Westeros after all How many hundreds of thousands of lives have you changed for the better here Perhaps this is where you belong Where you can do the most good
I fought so that no child born into Slavers Bay would ever know what it was like to be bought or sold I will continue that fight here and beyond But this is not my home
And when you get back to your home who supports you
The common people
Lets be generous and assume thats going to happen Here in Slavers Bay you had the support of the common people and only the common people What was that like ruling without the rich House Targaryen is gone not a single person who shares your blood is alive to support you The Starks are gone as well our two terrible fathers saw to that The remaining Lannisters wont back you not ever Stannis Baratheon wont back you either his entire claim to the Throne depends on the illegitimacy of yours That leaves the Tyrells Not impossible but not enough
Lannister Targaryen Baratheon Stark Tyrell Theyre all just spokes on a wheel This ones on top then that ones on top and on and on it spins crushing the people on the ground
Its a beautiful dream Stopping the wheel Youre not the first person to have dreamt it
Im not going to stop the wheel Im going to break the wheel
You said whoever wins would fight at the Great Pit in front of the queen I won
You struck me
Ive been flogged if it makes you happy Im the best youve got If I win at the Great Pit how much can you sell me for
Youre a free man you could have gone anywhere why did you come back
Let me fight for her and I belong to you
Thirsty Confess
Ill get out of here you realize Before long
Confess
I can make you a wealthy woman A lady of the court
Confess
I can make sure you die in the most hideous way imaginable and all I do is sit here imagining ways for you to die
Does it hurt
No
Good
How are you
Im not the one who got punched and kicked in the face
You know what I mean
Im good
Are you scared
A little
Me too
Whos there
Olly
Come in
I heard what happened
Not to worry Men brawl from time to time Its only natural
Figured you were hungry
Youre a good lad
Wanted to ask you something If youve got the time
I need to check on baby Sam
Now then How can I help
Its about the Lord Commander
Yes
Hes going up to Hardhome to save all them wildlings Wildlings killed my mom and dad They killed everyone in my village
Weve been fighting them for years
This wasnt a fight We were farmers and they slaughtered us So whys he saving them
Wildlings are people just like us There are good ones and bad ones
The one hes travelling with the one with the red beard he led the raid on my village
Olly
How can he trust him
Ive seen the army of the dead Ive seen the white walkers and theyre coming for us for all the living And when its time well need every last man we can find
But what if we let the wildings through the gates and they cut our throats while we sleep
Jons taking a risk but he has to We dont stand a chance otherwise Sometimes a man has to make hard choices choices that might look wrong to others but you know are right in the long run
You believe that
With all my heart
Try not to worry Olly Ive been worrying about Jon for years He always comes back
You trust me Jon Snow
Does that make me a fool
We are fools together now
Lord of Bones Been a long time
Last time I saw you the little crow was your prisoner The other way around now What happened
War
You call that a war The greatest army the North has ever seen cut to pieces by a southern king
We should gather the elders find somewhere quiet to talk
You dont give the orders here
Im not giving an order
Why arent you in chains
Hes not my prisoner
What is he
Were allies
You fucking traitor You fight for the crows now
I dont fight for the crows
Were not here to fight Were here to talk
Is that right You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking Tormund And when youre done talking do you get down on your knees and suck his cock
Gather the elders and lets talk
My names Jon Snow Im Lord Commander of the Nights Watch Were not friends Weve never been friends We wont become friends today This isnt about friendship This is about survival This is about putting a 700 foot wall between you and whats out there
You built that wall to keep us out
Since when do the crows give 2 shits if we live
In normal times we wouldnt But these arent normal times The white walkers dont care if a mans Free Folk or Crow Were all the same to them Meat to their army But together we can beat them
Beat the white walkers Good luck with that Run from them maybe
Its not a trick Its a gift for those who join us
Dragonglass A man of the Nights Watch used one of these daggers to kill a walker
You saw this
No But I trust the man
There are old stories about Dragonglass
There are old stories about ice spiders big as hounds
And with the things weve seen you dont believe them
Come with me and Ill share these weapons
Come with you where
There are good lands south of the wall The Nights Watch will allow you through the tunnel and allow your people to farm those lands
I knew Mance Rayder He never wanted a war with the Nights Watch he wanted a new life for his people For you Were prepared to give you that new life
If 
If you swear you join us when the real war begins
Where is Mance
He died
How
I put an arrow through his heart
I say we send the Lord Commander back to Castle Black with no eyes
None of you saw Mance die I did The Southern King who broke our army Stannis wanted to burn him alive to send him a message Jon Snow defied that cunts orders His arrow was mercy What it did took courage and thats what we need today the courage to make peace with men weve been fighting for generations
I lost my father my uncle and 2 brothers fighting the damn crows
Im not asking you to forget your dead Ill never forget mine I lost 50 brothers the night that Mance attacked the wall But Im asking you to think about your children now Theyll never have children of their own if we dont band together The Long Night is coming and the dead come with it No clan can stop them The free folk cant stop them The Nights Watch cant stop them And all the southern kings cant stop them Only together all of us and even then it might not be enough but at least then well give the fuckers a fight
You vouch for this man Tormund
Hes prettier than both my daughters but he knows how to fight Hes young but he knows how to lead He didnt have to come to Hardhome He came because he needs us And we need him
My ancestors would spit on me if I broke bread with a crow
So would mine but fuck em theyre dead Ill never trust a man in black But I trust you Tormund If you say this is the way were with you
This is the way
Im with Tormund We stay here were dead men At least with King Crow theres a chance
Tormund
Keep that new life you want to give us Keep your glass King Crow Soon as you get on his ships theyre gonna slit your throats and dump your bodies to the bottom of the Shivering Sea Thats our enemy That has always been our enemy
I fucking hate Thenns
How many are with us 5000
Im not good at counting
Were leaving too many behind
The free folk are stubborn You know how long it took Mance to band them together 20 fucking years
And he knew them better than I ever will
Theyre running out of food and theres nothing to hunt Theyll come around
Johnna is gonna look after you Shes in charge you listen to her
I wanna go with you
I need to get the old folks on the boats Im right behind you I promise Go on
Lokh kif rukh
Shut the gate
Shut the gate
Wait Open the gate Let us in Help us Please open it
Ready your arrows
Get in line Get in line
Hold the line Hold the line NIGHT
Lord Commander
Get them to the ship and come back for me
But youll never make it
Now
You should be on one of those boats
So should you  My little girl has gone on Theyre gonna let them pass the wall even if youre not there 
You have my word Ive given orders
Dont think youre gonna be there to enforce those orders
If they get through everyone dies
Nights Watch with me Move Move Move
The Dragonglass
Youre with me lad Now
Get the glass
The Dragonglass
Fuck the glass Were gonna die here
Go Go Go
Wun Wun to the sea
Lets go now Now
A band of 20 men maybe less They were in and out before anyone spotted them burnt our food stores to the ground all our siege weapons were destroyed dozens of tents were
Horses
Were still getting a count but hundreds are dead
20 men rode into our camp without a single guard sounding the alarm
The northerners know more about their land than we ever will
Put last nights guards in chains either they fell asleep or they were conspiring with the enemy Find out the truth and then hang them
Unless theres a thaw we cant press forward to Winterfell and we dont have enough food to get us back to Castle Black
Were not returning to Castle Black
Forgive me Your Grace I never claimed to be an expert in military matters But if we cant march forward and we wont march back
Have the dead horses butchered for meat
Open the gates
It was a failure
It wasnt
I went to save them I failed
You didnt fail him or him or her Every one of them is alive because of you and no one else
I dont think that facts lost on them
You have a good heart Jon Snow It will get us all killed
You sent for me Your Grace
Find you some healthy horses and a few good men to guard you Im sending you back to Castle Black Tell the Lord Commander to send food supplies fresh horses in return when I take the throne Ill make sure the Nights Watch has all the men it requires He can guard all 19 castles if he so wishes
Your Grace youve named me your Hand
Yes
ings Hand should never abandon the King especially in a time of war
Youre not abandoning me youre obeying a command
A boy with a scroll could deliver this message
And if Jon Snow refuses a boy with a scroll what does the boy say I didnt name you hand for your expertise in military matters ride for Castle Black dont come back empty handed
Your Grace perhaps Queen and Princess Shireen could accompany me
My family stays with me
At least let me take Shireen A siege is no place for a little girl
My family stays with me
Whats this one now
A True Telling by Grand Maester Munkun
Well that sounds like a proper story
Ser Byron Swann wanted to kill the dragon Vhagar He polished his shield for a week til the steel was like a mirror Then he crouched behind it and crept forward hoping the dragon would only see his own reflection
But the dragon only saw a dumb man holding a mirrored shield
And burnt him to a crisp
Thus ending the dragonslaying career of Ser Byron Swann I made you something Princess
Do you like it
Hes beautiful
Thank you
Youre very welcome
Will you make me a doe too so that he can have company
Of course I will
But why am I getting a present
Because you deserve it My son was always on me trying to teach me to read Gods I was stubborn about it Made it this far without reading seemed to me I could make it to the grave I wish I had listened to them This is my own poor way of saying thank you for teaching me to be a grown up Ill be gone for a few days Princess Ill want to hear all about the dance of dragons when Im back
Youll just have to read it yourself
Prince Doran
Forgive us we started without you Please sit
Princess Myrcella
Uncle
What a lovely dress
You dont like it
You must be cold
Not at all The Dornish climate agrees with me
Prince Trystane Hows your jaw
A fleabite
What are you doing in Dorne
Looking out for the safety of my niece the princess Myrcella
And rather than send a raven or speak to me directly you decided to enter my country in secret and abduct our guest by force
We received a threatening message The princesss necklace in the jaws of a viper
That necklace was stolen from my room
Ah Excellent The last meal before the beheading
We cant behead you Many in Dorne want war But Ive seen war Ive seen the bodies piled on the battlefields Ive seen the orphans starving in the cities I dont want to lead my people into that hell
No you want to break bread with the Lannisters
And that is precisely what we are doing Let us drink to Tommen the first of his name the King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms
King Tommen insists on his sisters return to the capital
Im afraid he does
I cannot disobey my Kings command She will return with you to Kings Landing And my son Prince Trystane will accompany you both If the alliance between Dorne and the Iron Throne is to continue their engagement must stand
I accept
One more thing My brother was named to the small council before his death Your father understood the importance of keeping Dorne in the loop With Oberyn gone Trystane will take his place on the small council
You have my word
The word of a Kingslayer
No wonder you cant stand You have no spine
You are mother to four of my nieces girls I love very much For their sake I hope you live a long life Talk to me that way again and you wont
May I inquire into the fate of my man
Tell me Ser Jaime in Kings Landing how do they punish a commoner who strikes a prince
He said it was just a fleabite The fault is mine Bronn is merely a soldier following my orders If anyone should be punished its me
Prince Trystane must learn judgement if hes to rule one day Ill let him decide
I have learned the value of mercy from my father I will set your man free
Youre a good man
On one condition
Why do we play Im better than you Ill always be better than you Have I ever missed once I dont think I cant recall You must love humiliation or pain Which do you love most Humiliation or pain That one hurt didnt it You going to cry Give up little sister
Youre going to miss
I never miss
You will Youre thinking too much Now youre nervous What if shes right
Luck
Now its my turn
Youre too slow Youve always been too slow
Am I going to be happy at the end of this walk
Youll find out very soon
Say it one more time handsome Who am I
The most beautiful woman in the world
And thats the truth
Slut
Prince Doran Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
I didnt realize there were knights of the Blackwater
Only the one
I believe youve already met Prince Trystane
Prince Sorry about the other day
Prince Trystane here is a man of mercy Hes agreed to grant you your freedom
Im glad to hear it The pie looks good
There was one condition
Perhaps some soup instead
Oysters clams and cockels Oysters clams and cockels Oysters clams and cockels Oysters clams and cock
How much for your little clam
Oysters clams and cockels Oysters clams and cockels
Come on
Some oysters girl Im talking to you Girl Are you deaf Girl
Lord Tyrell On behalf of the Iron Bank may I be the first to welcome you to the free city of Braavos I hope your journey was trouble free
Bit of chop the last few days but nothing too awful Good to see the old chap is still guarding the Harbor
And how goes the harvest in the Reach
Vintnors say this might be the best year for red grapes in half a century If we come to a satisfactory arrangement Ill be sure to send the Arbors finest your way
Im afraid I dont partake
Some consider usury distasteful dishonorable Pure nonsense of course
Im glad we see eyetoeye on this matter
Did you know that at one point Maegor the third tried to outlaw it in the Seven Kingdoms Wanted to arrest anyone caught charging interest and cut off both their hands
Most unfortunate for the glovers
If a man charges low interest on a loan then he has nothing to gain and everything to lose so why charge him Whereas a reward makes a man willing to gamble
We are not gamblers here at the Iron Bank Lord Tyrell
You are the worlds best gamblers And all those bets you won built this
Im afraid I still have a good deal of work to do
Oh nonsense Works over Do you sing
I dont have that gift
Its not a gift its a skill anyone can learn it So give me a kiss by the Long Canall and give me two kisses in Salty Town for we are going to die tomorrow The bareheaded beggar the king with his crown
I thought that old shit would never stop singing
It wasnt bad though
The Tyrells can all rot in hell treasonous cunts They were going to make that boyfucker Renly king
This is the place lads The sleekest little minks in Braavos
Youre buying
Oh Im buying But I never was good at sharing
Sell your fish somewhere else
Oh let her in Brusco Im hungry Come here sweetness
They say oysters get the juices flowing Well take half a dozen
Three coppers
Heres a silver because the lady likes you
Too old
Brea
Too old
I have just the one Anara our most expensive girl but well worth it I assure you
Too old
Do you have what I want or not
Of course Of course
Fresh Come on the lads are hungry
Nothing better for you cock stand than fresh oysters
Ill have one
Who let this girl in Shoo shoo
Good
Ill tell you when were done
Youll have a fresh one for me tomorrow
Of course
Ill have you whipped girl Go on
Valaar morghulis
And
The Thin Man wasnt hungry today
Perhaps thats why the man is thin
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
A girl has work to do
Your rebellion is over You can swear your allegiance to me now or you can die
I believe in second chances I dont believe in third chances
You write like a 7 year old
Your maester kindly agreed to copy it over for me
He didnt try to make you pay
Then maybe hes changed The Queen will be thrilled to know youll be bringing her daughter home
She will
You love her very much dont you
Of course shes my niece
I wasnt talking about her
You think I disapprove Why Because people disapprove of that sort of thing where you are from They disapproved of Oberyn and me where you are from Here no one blinked an eye 100 years ago no one would have blinked an eye at you if you had been named Targaryen Its always changing who were supposed to love and who were notThe only thing that stays the same is that we want who we want
I know your daughter had no part in the terrible thing that happened to the man I loved Perhaps even you were innocent of that
Father Arent you cold
No What are you reading
The Dance of Dragons
Whats it about
Its the story of the fight between Rhaenyra Targaryen and her halfbrother Aegon for control of the Seven Kingdoms Both of them thought they belonged on the Iron Throne When people started for declaring for one of them or the other their fight divided the kingdom in two Brothers fought brothers Dragons fought dragons By the time it was over thousands were dead And it was a disaster for the Targaryens as well They never truly recovered
The dance of dragons Why is that a dance
Thats just what they call it
Doesnt make much sense
I think its poetic
If you had to choose between Rhaenyra and Aegon who would you have chosen
I wouldnt have chosen either Its all the choosing sides that made things so horrible
Sometimes a person has to choose Sometimes the world forces his hand If a man knows what he is and remains true to himself the choice is not choice at all He must fulfill his destiny and become who he is meant to be However much he may hate it
Its alright father
You dont even know what Im talking about
It doesnt matter I want to help you Is there any way I can help
Yes there is
Good I want to Im the Princess Shireen of House Baratheon and Im your daughter
Forgive me
Wheres my father I want to see my father
It will all be over soon Princess
Wheres my father No you cant do this father where are you
Let me see my father Where are you please
Its what the Lord wants Its a good thing A great thing
The year is now my Lord For you we offer up this girl that you may cleanse her with your fire and that its light may lead our way
If we dont act then well all starve here all of us but if we make this sacrifice
Accept this token of our faith my lord and lead us from the darkness Lord of Light show us the way
Mother please mother Mother please mother
I cant
Theres no other way She has Kings blood
Lord of Light protect us for the night is dark and full of terrors
Mother dont do this please Please help Dont do this Please father Mother help
No
Where have you been
Just making sure everythings in order
Free citizens of Meereen By the blessings of the Graces and her majesty the Queen welcome to the Great Games
My queen our first contest
the strong or the quick
I fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen
I fight and die for your glory oh glorious queen
Theyre waiting for you Clap your hands
That one the smaller man no question thats where you should put your money
The smaller man it is
Im not putting my money anywhere
Kings and queens never bet on the games Perhaps you should go find someone who does
People used to bet against me when I fought in the pits He would have bet against me Common novice mistake
I have spent much of my life in Meereen and in my experience larger men do triumph over smaller man far more often than not
Has your experience ever involved any actual fighting You yourself have you ever tried to kill a man that was trying to kill you
Whenever I got into the pit against a beast like that one the crowd saw me all skin and bone back then then they saw a pile of angry muscles ready to murder me They couldnt get their money out fast enough But the pile of angry muscles never had any muscles here or here And the big men were always too slow to stop my dagger from going where their muscles werent Yes whenever I saw a beast like that one standing across from me making his beast faces I knew I could rest easy
You dont approve
Theres always been more than enough death in the world for my taste I can do without it in my leisure time
Fair enough yet its an unpleasant question but what great thing has ever been accomplished without killing or cruelty
Its easy to confuse what is with what ought to be Especially when what is has worked in your favor
Im not talking about myself Im talking about the necessary conditions of greatness
That is greatness
That is a vital part of the great city of Meereen Which has existed long before you arrived and will remain standing long after we have returned to the dirt
My father would have liked you
We ask again who will triumph
One day your great city will return to the dirt as well
At your command
If need be
A Meereenese champion
How many people will die to make this happen
If it comes to that they would have died for a good reason
Those men think theyre dying for a good reason
Someone elses reason
So your reasons are true and theirs are false They dont know their own minds but you do
Well said youre an eloquent man Doesnt mean youre wrong In my experience eloquent men are right every bit as often as imbeciles
or a Westerosi Knight
I fight and die for your glory oh glorious Queen
Your Grace
Shut your mouth
You can end this
She cannot
You can
Protect your queen
Your Grace Your Grace come with me I know a way out I know a way
Stay close
This way
The other side follow me
Protect your queen
Drogon
The Lord of Light has made good on his promise my king His fires have melted the snows away The way ahead is clear
We ride for Winterfell
And you will take it The Lord has shown me Bolton banners burning You will receive what is yours by right
Your Grace
Prepare to form up
Your Grace
Tell me
The men Many deserted before dawn
How many
Nearly half All the sellswords with all the horses
Your Grace
Speak up It cant be worse than mutiny
Cut her down
Your Grace The Lady Melisandre was just seen riding out of camp
Get the men into marching formation On to Winterfell
He raised his hands And they all stood up at once Tens of thousands of them the biggest army in the world
So what are you gonna do
Im gonna hope they dont learn how to climb the wall
But the Dragonglass
No ones ever getting that back now It wouldnt have mattered anyway unless we had a mountain of it
But you killed a White Walker
With Longclaw I saw them shatter steel axes like they were glass But Longclaw
Hes made of Valyrian steel How many Valyrian steel swords are left in the Seven Kingdoms
Not enough The first Lord Commander in history to sacrifice the lives of sworn Brothers to save the lives of Wildlings Hows it feel to be friends with the most hated man in Castle Black
You were friends with me when I first got here And I wasnt winning any elections back then
Heres to us then Long may they sneer
What
I wanted to ask you something To ask something of you Send me Gilly and the baby to Oldtown so I can become a Maester Thats what Im meant to be not this
I need you here Sam If you leave whos left to give me advice I trust
Well theres Edd
Ill be more use to you as a Maester More use to everyone now that Maester Aemons gone The Citadel has the worlds greatest library Ill learn about history strategy healing And other things Things that will help when they come
If Gilly stays here then shell die And the baby that she named after me will die And Ill end up dying too trying to protect them Which means that the last thing that Ill see in this world will be the look in her eyes when I fail them Id rather see a thousand White Walkers than see that
Thank you
You know that The Citadel will make you swear off women too
Theyll bloody try
Sam
What
Sam
Youve just been beaten half to death How did you
Very carefully
Im glad the end of the worlds working out for someone
Ill come back
To your return
To my return
My lady Stannis Stannis Baratheon is coming His whole army
How do you know its Stannis
Hes carrying his flaming heart banners From the Blackwater Ill never forget it
Trench here Another one 300 yards from the castle wall Hurry them along And send out a foraging party immediately The siege begins at sunrise
Theres not going to be a siege Your Grace Stannis leans onto a tree and groans
Bolton has women fighting for him
I do not fight for the Boltons Im Brienne of Tarth I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon I was there when he was murdered by a shadow with your face You murdered him With blood magic
I did
In the name of Renly of House Baratheon First of his Name Rightful King of the Andals and the First Men Lord of the Seven Kingdoms and Protector of the Realm I Brienne of Tarth sentence you to die Do you have any last words
Go on do your duty
Looks like were done here
I surrender I surrender
And I accept your surrender
Lets head back My wife must be lonely
My lady I have come to escort you back to your chamber
Go with her Please
I know what Ramsay is I know what hell do to me If Im going to die let it happen while theres some of me left
Die Who said anything about dying You cant die yet Your father was Warden of the North and Ramsay needs you Though I suppose he doesnt need all of you Just the parts hell use to make his heir Until youve given him a boy or two and hes finished using them Hes got incredible plans for those parts So Shall we wait for him to come back or shall we begin now
Youre leaving it to me Good Lets begin
Stop Stop
Open the gates
Hes coming back
I can see I have my work cut out for meYou two Out
You were the first person on my list you know For killing Syrio Forel remember him Probably not Ive gotten a few of the others The Many Faced God stole a few more for me Im glad he left me you Do you know who I am
I cant hear you
You know who I am Im Arya Stark
Do you know who you are
Youre no one Youre nothing
A girl has taken a life The wrong life
I was right about her
You were
Youre not ready Not at all
That mans life wasnt yours to take A girl stole from the Many Faced God Now a debt is owed
Only death can pay for life
No No No you dont die Dont die
Why are you crying
He was my friend
No he wasnt Didnt you listen to him
He was no one
But if youre Whos this
No one at all Just as a girl should have been before she took a face from the hall
The faces are for no one
You are still someone
And to someone
the faces are as good as poison
I cant see
Whats happening Whats happening
I wish you a safe journey home
Thank you
Forgive me child I wish you all the happiness in the world
Maybe Ill come visit you sometime
Maybe Ill come visit you
Dont wait too long Ive a noble woman to marry back home
You want a good girl but you need the bad pussy
Whenever youre ready My Lord
Try not to lose it this time
Ill never take it off again
I know you didnt want to leave Dorne But Im glad youre coming home Your mothers desperate to see you And Im glad Trystanes coming with us He seems like a nice boy Youre lucky Arranged marriages are rarely so so well arranged
Do you think mother will like him
If she sees youre happy Im sure she will
And you really believe that
Have you ever known your mother to like anyone aside from her children
She likes you
Im not so sure about that Listen Theres something Ive wanted to tell you Something I should have told you long ago So Now that youve seen more of the world youve learned how complicated things can be People can be The Lannisters and the Martells have hated each other for years but youve fallen in love with Trystane It was an accident really I mean what were the chances You happen to fall in love with the man you were assigned to marry My point is we dont choose whom we love We just Its beyond our control I sound like an idiot
No you dont
What Im trying to say What Im trying and failing to say
I know what youre trying to say
No Im afraid you dont
I do
I know About you and mother I think a part of me always knew And Im glad Im glad that youre my father
Myrcella
Myrcella
Myrcella Myrcella
You love her dont you How could you not Of course its hopeless for the both of you Sellsword from the fighting pits a disgraced knight Neither one of you is fit consort for a queen But we always want the wrong woman
Does he always talk so much
Jorah the Andal
Torgo Nudho
You should not be here
No but he is
Our queen ordered him exiled from city
Our queen would be dead if not for him
Its true And I would be dead if not for the little man
Dwarf I believe thats the word Apologies My Valyrian is a bit nostril
A bit rusty
Rusty Thank you
I am sorry Sorry I am not there to fight for my queen
You missed a good scrap
None of that matters now The longer we sit here bantering the longer Daenerys is out there in the wilderness
Hes right The dragon headed north If were going to find her thats where were to go
We Youre a Lannister The Queen intends to remove your family from power
And I intend to help her do it
Youve been here for how many days now Ive fought for her for years Since she was little more than a child
You betrayed her
Careful now
And she exiled you twice I believe
The second time thanks to you
Dont blame me for your crimes Mormont
Hes right The Queen exiled Jorah And hes right Jorah saved her life Perhaps she feels differently about him now Perhaps not The only way well know is if we ask her
Fine fine I suppose he can join us Just as long as he promises not to kill me in my sleep
If I ever kill you your eyes will be wide open
Forgive me but why would we bring you
Pardon me
Have you ever tracked animals in the wilderness
Not precisely but I have other skills thatd be very useful
Can you fight
I have fought I dont claim to be a great warrior
Are you good on a horse
Middling
So mainly you talk
And drink Ive survived so far
Which I respect But you would not help us on this expedition You would help us here in Meereen though None of us have any experience governing a city except for him You want to prove your value to the queen Prove it right here in Meereen
Hes a foreign dwarf that barely speaks the language Why would the Meereenese listen to him
They wouldnt They will listen to Grey Worm
Ill come with you Ill find our queen
You are not strong enough to go anywhere
I am
He is hes the toughest man with no balls Ive ever met But you still cant go The people believe in you They know you speak for the queen
Its true Only the Unsullied can keep the peace in Meereen If you leave half the city will consume the other half
And Missandei Our queen trusts no one more than Missandei Certainly not me The queens closest confidant the commander of the Unsullied and the foreign dwarf with the scarred face Good fortune my friends Meereen is ancient and glorious Try not to ruin her Looks like its you and me Jorah the Andal Lets find some good horses We have so much to talk about
Hello old friend
I thought we were so happy together until you abandoned me
I suppose theres no point in asking how you found me
The birds sing in the west the birds sing in the east If one knows how to listen They tell me youve already found favor with the Mother of Dragons
Well she didnt execute me so thats a promising start Now the heroes are off to find her and Im stuck here trying to placate a city on the brink of civil war Any advice for an old comrade
Information is the key You need to learn your enemies strengths and strategies You need to learn which of your friends are not your friends
If only I knew someone with a vast network of spies
If only A grand old city choking on violence corruption and deceit Who could possibly have any experience managing such a massive ungainly beast
I did miss you
Oh I know
We have to go home
My poor sweet thing Does it hurt We have to go home Drogon Can you take me back to Meereen
How far did you carry me
Drogon we need to return My people need me
Well theres no food At the very least you can hunt us some supper
Confess Confess
I have sinned I see that now How could I have been so blind for so long I want to be clean again I want absolution The Crone came to me with her lamp raised high and with its holy light
You wish to make a confession
Once Ive confessed will I be free
Your Grace will be dealt with according to her sins
The Mother have mercy then I lay with a man outside the bonds of marriage I confess
Name him
Lancel Lannister
Your cousin And the Kings squire
I was lonely and afraid
You had a husband
A husband of whoring every chance he got
His sins do not pardon your own
May the gods forgive me
Other men
No
No others
No
Speaking falsehoods before the Gods is a great crime You understand this
I do
There are those who say your children were not fathered by King Robert That they are bastards born of incest and adultery
A lie A lie from the lips of Stannis Baratheon He wants the Throne but his brothers children stand in his way so he claims they are not his brothers The filth There is not one shred of truth to it I deny it
Good But these are terrible charges And the realm must know the truth of them If Your Grace has given honest testimony your trial will prove your innocence
Trial I have confessed
To a single sin Others you have denied Your trial will separate the truths from the falsehoods
I bow to the wisdom of your High Holiness But if I might beg for just one drop of the Mothers mercy I havent seen my son I dont know how long its been I need to see him Please
You have taken the first step on a path back to righteousness In light of this I will permit you to return to the Red Keep
Thank you Thank you
The Mother is merciful It is her you should thank
I will I will I swear it day and night
Good
Am I free to go
After your atonement
My atonement
A sinner comes before you Cersei of House Lannister mother to his Grace King Tommen widow to his Grace King Robert She has committed the acts of falsehood and fornication She has confessed her sins and begged for forgiveness To demonstrate her repentance she will cast aside all pride all artifice and present herself as the gods made her to you The good people of the city She comes before you with a solemn heart Shorn of secrets Naked before the eyes of gods and men To make her walk of atonement
Shame Shame Shame
Bitch Whore All hail her royal tits
Ive had half as many cocks as the queen
Suck me off Suck me off you bitch
Your Grace Its good to have you back Come Well take you inside I need to have a look at those feet
May I have the honor of presenting the newest member of the Kingsguard
If it please Your Grace hes taken a holy vow of silence He has sworn that he will not speak until all his Graces enemies are dead and the evil has been driven from the realm
He came to your aid Stannis Now he needs you
We dont have enough men to make any difference
The wildlings will make a difference
The wildlings wont ever fight for Stannis I told you before
You saved their bloody lives If theyre going to live in the Seven Kingdoms safe behind our wall they ought to fight for the damn place
Its not their fight
Stannis
Shireen The princess
Lord Commander Its one of the wildlings you brought back Says he knows your Uncle Benjen Says hes still alive
Are you sure hes talking about Benjen
Says he was first Ranger Said he knows where to find him
Man says he saw your uncle at Hardhome the last full moon
He could be lying
Could be There are ways to find out
Where is he
Over there
For the Watch
For the Watch
For the Watch
For the Watch
For the Watch
Olly
Its the Lord Commander
Help me get him inside
Thorne did this
How many of your brothers do you think you can trust
Trust The men in this room
Does the wolf know you
We need all the help we can get
Ser Davos
I saw him in the flames fighting at Winterfell
I cant speak for the flames but hes gone
He was our Lord Commander
He never should have been
You all know why youre here Jon Snow is dead NIGHT
Who killed him
I did
And Bowen Marsh and Othell Yarwyck and the other officers in this castle NIGHT
Murderers NIGHT
Traitors
Youre right
Weve committed treason all of us Jon Snow was my Lord Commander I had no love for him That was no secret But I never once disobeyed an order Loyalty is the foundation on which the Nights Watch is built and the Watch means everything to me I have given my life we have all given our lives to the Nights Watch Jon Snow was going to destroy the Nights Watch He let the wildlings through our gates as no Lord Commander has ever done before He gave them the very land on which they reaved and raped and murdered Lord Commander Snow did what he thought was right Ive no doubt about that And what he thought was right would have been the end of us He thrust a terrible choice upon us and we made it
Hell have seen we didnt come Thorne will have made it official by now Castle Black is his
I dont care whos sitting at the high table Jon was my friend and those fuckers butchered him Now we return the favor
We dont have the numbers
We have a direwolf
Its not enough I didnt know Lord Commander Snow for long but I have to believe he wouldnt have wanted his friends to die for nothing
If you were planning to see tomorrow you picked the wrong room We all die today I say we do our best to take Thorne with us when we go
We need to fight but we dont need to die Not if we have help NIGHT
Whos gonna help us
Youre not the only ones who owe your lives to Jon Snow
Bolt the door Dont let anyone in Ill be back as soon as I can
She was 11 the first time I saw her
The kennelmasters daughter She smelled of dog I wasnt much older but everybody was already afraid of me You certainly were
Myranda wasnt though What could I do to her that those hounds couldnt She was fearless There was nothing she wouldnt do
Your pain will be paid for a thousand times over I wish you could be here to watch
Shall I have a grave dug for her my lord Or would you rather the men build a pyre
Buried burned
This is good meat Feed it to the hounds
Your command of the cavalry was impressive Thanks to you the false king Stannis Baratheon is dead Do you know who struck the killing blow
No
A shame Id reward the man Still a great victory Do you feel like a victor
I rebelled against the crown to arrange your marriage to Sansa Stark Do you think that burning wagons in the night and mowing down tired outnumbered Baratheons is the same as facing a prepared and provisioned Lannister army
No
A reckoning will come We need the North to face it The entire North They wont back us without Sansa Stark We no longer have Sansa Stark You played your games with her You played your games with the heir to the Iron Islands and now theyre both gone
I have a team of men after them with some of my best hounds They wont get far
Im glad to hear it Without Sansa you wont be able to produce an heir And without an heir well
lets hope the maesters are right and Lady Walders carrying a boy
We cant stop
We have to cross here
I cant
Its the only way to throw off the hounds
But its too cold I cant I wont make it Ill die
Ive seen what his hounds do to a person This way is better
Over here Come on
Sansa Sansa
Stay here Ill lure them away
No I wont make it without you
You will Go north only north Jon is Lord Commander at Castle Black Hell help you
Where is Lady Bolton
Dead
Liar
She broke her leg jumping from the ramparts I left her to die in the snow
I cant wait to see what parts Ramsay cuts off you this time dy woman
Lady Sansa I offer my services once again I will shield your back and keep your council and give my life for yours if need be I swear it by the old gods and the new
And I vow that you shall always have a place by my hearth and
Meat and mead at my table
Meat and mead at my table And I pledge to ask no service of you that might bring you dishonor I swear it by the old gods and the new Arise
Your Grace Im sorry to disturb you A ship from Dorne has sailed into the harbor
Myrcella
Do you remember the first time you saw a dead body
Mother
All I could think about when she died was what would happen to her now Every day every night what does Mama look like now Has she started to bloat Has her skin turned black Have her lips peeled back from her teeth
I think about locking Myrcella in a crypt
I think about her beautiful little face starting to collapse
Shh shh Dont think about it
I have to I have to Its not right she has to suffer alone
Shes not suffering Shes gone No one can hurt her anymore
She was good From her first breath she was so sweet I dont know where she came from She was nothing like me No meanness no jealous just good
I know
I thought if I could make something so good so pure maybe Im not a monster
Listen listen to me She was my daughter and I failed her
No I knew this would happen The witch told me years ago She promised me three children She promised me theyd die And gold their shrouds Everything she said came true You couldnt have stopped it Its prophecy Its fate
You dont believe that
Of course I do You told me yourself when Father died You said we had to stay together You said people would try to tear us apart take whats ours That was a prophecy too I didnt listen to you and everything you said came true
The Seven Hells brim with the souls of saintly men They scream in agony and their shame is so great they do not feel the flames for now they see if not for a single sin they concealed they were saved
Id like to see my brother
Confess
Please How is he At least tell me that
Confess
I am the queen and I demand to see my brother
Sinners dont make commands They make confessions
Septa Unella
Our other guests need you
There
Septa Unella can be overzealous at times Ill speak with her
My brother can you tell me how he is
It isnt Ser Loras that brings me here Your husband misses you dearly The love between a man and wife is sacred It reflects the love the gods have for all of us But sin leads us away from the sacred And only confession can purge sin
I have nothing to confess
So you believe you are pure Perfect Wholly without sin
None of us are
You have started down the path But you have many miles to go
I always envied Oberyn He lived He truly lived Sailed around the world Fought men from every country Lay with the most beautiful women alive
And men
And men He experienced everything while I sat here in Dorne trying my best to keep my people alive and well fed But that is life We each have our roles
Oberyn was born to be an adventurer And I was born to rule
The gods are not fools You would have been a lousy adventurer And Oberyn pfft he would have been a terrible ruler
Your mother is a brilliant woman you know that
Prince Doran
The Princess Myrcella
When was the last time you left this palace You dont know your own people Their disgust for you Elia Martell raped and murdered and you did nothing Oberyn martell butchered and you did nothing Youre not a Dornishman Youre not our prince
My son Trystane
Your son is weak just like you And weak men will never rule Dorne again
I told you Im not hungry
Were not here to feed you
Were here to kill you
You want her to do it or me
We are family I dont want to hurt you
Her or me
Good
Smart boy
Youre a greedy bitch you know that
Were never going to fix whats wrong with this city from the top of an 800foot pyramid
Well be fine Were dressed like common merchants
You walk like a rich person
Youve spent a lot of time studying the way rich people walk
You walk as though the paving stones were your personal property I used to steal from people like you when I was a boy
Its a good thing youre not a boy anymore because you have no cock
For your baby To eat
She thinks you want to eat her baby
His Valyrian is terrible He only wants to give you money so your baby can eat
Mhysa means mother in Valyrian
I know what mhysa means
Who wrote it
Hard to know Our queen is not as popular in Meereen as she used to be
The Sons of the Harpy
Very possibly Daenerys Targaryen took away their most valuable property told them human beings werent even property to begin with You can see why theyre unhappy Of course it could also be the freed men
For the night is dark and full of terrors
The Lord of Light sent the Mother of Dragons to you and those who love the darkness chased her away
Many of the former slaves feel that Daenerys has abandoned them
She did fly away on a dragon and not come back
How will you respond Will you wring your hands while you wait for the Mother of Dragons to return Or will you you take up her flames yourselves Will you fight for your own salvation now that Queen Daenerys is not here to fight for you
Its a problem
Fear has brought Meereen to a standstill Whoever you are wherever you go someone in this city wants to murder you We cant fight an enemy we dont know
The Sons of the Harpy planned their attack in the fighting pits very carefully which means they take orders from someone
And have you started looking for that someone
My little birds have already taken wing Soon theyll return singing songs of men in gold masks
Well we wont be sailing to Westeros anytime soon
Goat
Ram
You think our friend got him
Dont know anything else that can melt a rams horn
Were on the right path then
Perhaps shes tired of being queen I dont think she likes it very much
Shes too smart to like it
Maybe shes flown somewhere else somewhere far away from men like us
Ive been all over the world Theres no escaping men like us
Theres no escaping her eh You keep coming back Why
You know why
isnt it frustrating wanting someone who doesnt want you back
Of course it is
Youre a romantic I admire that Sometimes I look at you and I think So thats what Ill be like when I grow old
If you grow old
If I grow old I hope I do I want to see what the world looks like when shes done conquering it
So do I
Huh an army
Not an army A horde
Dothraki
They have her
Maybe she saw a ghost My friends mother saw a ghost and her hair turned white
Pink people are afraid of the sun It burns their skin This one stands too long in the sun and her hair goes white
You think shes got white pussy hair too You ever been with a girl with white pussy hair
Only when I was fucking your grandma
Ill ask Khal Moro for a night with you What do you think
Pretty eyes but shes an idiot
She doesnt have to be smart to get fucked in the ass
I like to talk when Im finished Otherwise we might as well be dogs
For you my Khal The whitehaired girl we found in the hills
Look at those lips blood of my blood
Blueeyed women are witches
It is known
Cut off her head before she casts a spell on you
Even if I was blind Id hear my wives say Cut off her head and Id know this woman was beautiful Im glad Im not blind Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time what is better than that
Killing another Khal
Yes killing another Khal
Conquering a city and taking her people as slaves and taking her idols back to Vaes Dothrak
Breaking a wild horse forcing it to submit to your will
Seeing a beautiful woman naked for the first time is among the five best things in life
Do not touch me
I am Daenerys Stormborn of the House Targaryen the First of Her Name the Unburnt Queen of Meereen Queen of the Andals and the Rhoynar of the First Men Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons
You are nobody the millionth of your name Queen of Nothing slave of Khal Moro Tonight I will lie with you and if the Great Stallion is kind you will give me a son Do you understand
I will not lie with you And I will bear no children for you or anyone else Not until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east
I told you she was a witch Cut off her head
I like her She has spirit
I was wife of Khal Drogo son of Khal Bharbo
Khal Drogo is dead
I know I burnt his body
Forgive me I did not know It is forbidden to lie with a Khals widow No one will touch you You have my word
If you will escort me back to Meereen I will see that your khalasar is given a thousand horses as a sign of my gratitude
When a Khal dies there is only one place for his Khaleesi
Vaes Dothrak The Temple of the Dosh Khaleen
To live out her days with the widows of dead Khals It is known
Thank you
Are you listening blind girl Do you hear them talking Do any of them talk to you No So sad
Stand and fight blind girl
I cant see
Thats your problem not mine
See you tomorrow
Ser Davos we have no cause to fight We are both anointed knights

Boys Ive been running from men like that ll my life In my learned opinion we open that door NIGHT
And theyll slaughter us all NIGHT
They want to come in theyre gonna come in
Aye but we dont need to make it easy for them NIGHT
Edd is our only chance NIGHT
Its a sad fucking statement if Dolorous Edd is our only chance
Theres always the Red Woman NIGHT

They were all so happy THREE
So were you once

Would you get out of here Were sparring
Who are you gonna spar with when Ned goes off to the Eyrie
I dont know
What about him
Wylis come here
Hodor
But hes got giants blood
And youve got training Sounds like a fair match to me
Benjen always lifts his chin when hes about to charge
And lowers it when hes going to dodge my lady
Hodor talks
You leave the fighting to the little lords Wylis Come along now Its no place for you
Oh Nan look at the size of him If he ever learned to fight hed be unstoppable
Well hes never going to learn to fight because hes a stable boy So leave him be THREE
It is time to go
Please a little longer
You finally show me something I care about and then you drag me away THREE
It is beautiful beneath the sea but if you stay too long youll drown
I wasnt drowning I was home
Wylis
Hodor
I saw you as a boy You could talk What happened
Hodor
Wheres Meera
Hodor
You shouldnt be here Its not safe outside the cave
Its not safe anywhere
I saw that Hodor wasnt always Hodor
Hodor
His real name is Wylis And he could talk and fight and and then 
Whats wrong
The ThreeEyed Raven says theres a war coming
And were going to fight it in there
Brandon Stark needs you
For what I sit in there and I watch him have his visions and nothing ever happens
He isnt going to stay there forever And out there he needs you
Its time Ser Davos Open the door and the men inside can rejoin their brothers in peace Well even set the wolf free north of the Wall where it belongs Nobody needs to die tonight
Ive never been much of a fighter
Apologies for what youre about to see
Come on
Attack
Fight you cowards
You fucking traitor
The only traitors here are the ones who shoved their knives into their Lord Commanders heart
For thousands of years the Nights Watch has held Castle Black against the Wildlings
Until you
Throw them into the cells where they belong
Took a lot of knives Ill have my men get the wood for a fire Bodies to burn
Right so there she is high and mighty Queen Cersei tits and ass jiggling in the breeze
All of a sudden she looks my way Gives me a little smile like Well So all right you know Ive never been shy and Im blessed down south so I put it right out Shes never seen anything like it I mean shes used to her brother and from what I hear Jaime Lannisters half an inch shy of an inch She sees it and I swear to the gods she licks her lips Well you all know me You know I wouldnt lie about this
Get out of my way KING
Kings orders Your Grace
What are the kings orders KING
He would like you to remain in the Red Keep Your Grace for your own protection
Youre barring me from attending my own daughters funeral KING
Forgive me Your Grace by the kings command I cannot let you pass
I would like to speak to my son KING
He has left the Red Keep Your Grace
She grew up
Almost
Have we caught Prince Trystanes killers I expect it was Mother
Your mother wouldnt do that
Yes she would
Are you angry with her
Of course not
Then why didnt you let her come She has every right to be here
They told me she wouldnt be allowed in the sept If she had tried 
Theyre not putting your mother in a cell ever again Not while Im here Why havent you gone to see her Everything she endured she did it for you
Dont you think I know that Im sorry But I cant
Why not
When the Faith Militant seized her and Margaery what did I do When they paraded her through the streets like a whore what did I do
We all fail sometimes
The king is supposed to be the Protector of the Realm If I cant even protect my own wife or my own mother what good am I
Go and see your mother and ask her to forgive you
Your Grace Lord Commander
I want to see my wife
The gods wait for Queen Margaery to confess her crimes and seek their mercy The king must wait as well
Go and see your mother Tommen
Youre a bold man
On the contrary I fear a great deal The Father the Mother the Warrior
Do you know why we use these stones To remind us not to fear death We close our eyes on this world and open them on the next
You must long for the next life
In truth I fear that too
You imprisoned and humiliated my sister
Your sister sought the gods mercy and atoned for her sin
What about my sins
I broke a sacred oath and stabbed my king in the back I killed my own cousin When the gods judged my brother guilty I helped him escape their justice What atonement do I deserve
You would spill blood in this holy place
Oh the gods wont mind Theyve spilled more blood than the rest of us combined
Go on then I deserve it We all do We are weak vain creatures We live only by the Mothers mercy
They should be closer if you mean for them to save you
I dont Theyd never reach me before you struck
Ive fought against worse odds
No doubt many of us would fall But who are we hmm We have no names no family Every one of us is poor and powerless And yet together we can overthrow an empire
Mother
Did they put her in the red gown or the gold
Gold
Good It was always her color
Im sorry for keeping you here I shouldnt have but I was I didnt want to lose you again
I understand Im glad to see you
I know I should have come sooner I wanted to I was wrong
Its all right
No it isnt
I should have executed all of them I should have pulled down the sept onto the High Sparrows head before I let them do that to you as you would have for me You raised me to be strong and I wasnt But I want to be Help me
Always
If I lost my cock Id drink all the time
Meaning no offense He makes dwarf jokes I make eunuch jokes
I do not make dwarf jokes
You think them
So the fleet Its been burned
We are searching for the men who burned the ships but nobody saw anything
Surely theres some good news lurking somewhere
Astapor and Yunkai have stopped asking us for aid
Perhaps they can tell us their secret
The Masters have retaken both cities Outside of Meereen the whole of Slavers Bay has returned to the slavers
What about the dragons We have two of them here beneath the pyramid
They are not eating They havent touched any food since Queen Daenerys left
Daenerys is the dragon queen Cant very well let the dragons starve thats obvious
If a dragon does not want to eat how do you force him to eat
Dragons do not do well in captivity
How do you know this
Thats what I do I drink and I know things
The dragons Aegon used to conquer Westeros ranged over hundreds of miles Then Daeneryss ancestors started chaining them up in pens A few generations later the last dragons were no larger than cats They must be unchained or theyll waste away Missandei how many times were you in the company of these dragons
Many times
And did they ever harm you
Never
Dragons are intelligent More intelligent than men according to some maesters They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies I am their friend
Do they know that
They will Its time they had their supper
Im friends with your mother Im here to help Dont eat the help
When I was a child an uncle asked what gift I wanted for my name day I begged him for one of you It wouldnt even have to be a big dragon I told him It could be little like me
Everyone laughed like it was the funniest thing they had ever heard Then my father told me the last dragon had died a century ago I cried myself to sleep that night
But here you are
Next time I have an idea like that punch me in the face
Whats your name
Whats your name
No one
I dont believe that
You dont believe that
Who are you
No one
If a girl says her name a man will let her sleep under a roof tonight
A girl has no name
If a girl says her name a man will feed her tonight
A girl has no name
If a girl says her name a man will give her eyes back
A girl has no name
Come
Leave it A girl is not a beggar anymore
He came upon the bodies on our way here
Half a dozen men Your best hunters
They obviously had help
I didnt think lady Sansa killed them all by herself Thank you for this report Lord Kastark
We know where shes going Her brothers at Castle Black
Ned Starks last surviving son
Jon Snow is a bastard not a Stark
So was I Father
Your hold on the North will never be secure as long as a Stark can walk through that door
Castle Black isnt defended on the southern side And the few men left are barely men at all Farm boys and thieves With a small force we could storm the castle kill Jon Snow 
Murder the Lord Commander of the Nights Watch Youd unite every house in the North against us
We dont need every house in the North The Umbers the Manderlys and the Karstarks command more soldiers than all the other houses combined With their support none could challenge us
The Starks lost my house the day King Rob cut off my fathers head Its time for new blood in the North
If you acquire a reputation as a mad dog youll be treated as a mad dog Taken out back and slaughtered for pig feed
My lords Lady Walda has given birth A boy Redcheeked and healthy
My congratulations Lord Bolton
Congratulations Father I look forward to meeting my new brother
Youll always be my firstborn
Thank you for saying that It means a great deal to me
Maester Wolkan send ravens to all the Northern houses Roose Bolton is dead Poisoned by our enemies

Its cold out here Ramsay I need to feed him
Ramsay where is your father Ramsay Where is Lord Bolton
I am Lord Bolton
Ramsay Ramsay please Ill leave Winterfell Ill go back to the Riverlands Please Ramsay Hes your brother
I prefer being an only child
I saw her with a man I dont think he hurt her She didnt want to leave him he didnt want to leave her
You dont know which way she went
I spent three days looking for her She disappeared
How did she look
She looked good She wasnt exactly dressed like a lady
No she wouldnt be
What happened at Winterfell
I shouldve gone with you while I had the chance
It was a difficult choice my lady
Weve all had to make difficult choices
We shouldnt be lighting fires Its not safe He wont stop hunting us
We just have to make it to Castle Black Once were with Jon Ramsay wont be able to touch us
Jon will have me killed the moment I step through the gate
I wont let him Ill tell him the truth about Bran and Rickon
And the truth about the farm boys I killed in their place The truth about Ser Rodrik who I beheaded
And the truth about Rob who I betrayed
When you take the black all your crimes are forgiven
I dont want to be forgiven I can never make amends to your family for all the things that Ive done Theyll keep you safer than I ever could
Youre not coming with us
I would have taken you all the way to the Wall I would have died to get you there
May I take one of the horses
Where will you go
Home
The Glovers have retaken Deepwood Motte
And the Ironborn who held it
They died fighting to a man
What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die
But they did and our invasion died with them Deepwood Motte was our last stronghold on the mainland
They we will take more
Why For more pinecones and rocks
Because I order it
We can defeat anyone at sea but well never hold lands and castles against mainland armies
Not if our captains defy my orders abandon their posts and sacrifice our men on foolish mission
I wont apologize for trying to rescue Theon
Then where is he
Where is your kingdom We took those castles because the northerners marched off to war That war is over The last time we provoked them too far I watched from that window as they breached our walls and knocked down our towers I lost two brothers that day
And I lost three sons The War of the Five Kings they call it Well the other four are dead When you rule the Iron Islands you can wage all the peace you wan But for now shut your mouth and obey or I will make another heir who will
Let me pass You fool move aside for your king
Havent I always brother
I thought youd be rotting under some foreign sea by now
What is dead may never die
Has the custom changed since Ive been gone Arent you supposed to repeat the words
You can mock our god without my help
I dont mock the Drowned God I am the Drowned God From Oldtown to Qarth when men see my sails they pray
Youre old brother Youve had your time Now let another rule
I heard you lost your mind during the storm on the Jade Sea They tied you to the mast to keep you from jumping overboard
They did
And when the storm passed you cut out their tongues
I needed silence
What kind of an Ironborn loses his senses during a storm
I am the storm brother The first storm and the last And youre in my way
Lord take your servant Balon back beneath the waves Feed the creatures of your kingdom on his flesh Pull his bones down to your depths to rest beside his ancestors and his children
What is dead may never die
Im going to find out who did this Im going to feed them to the sharks while they live I swear it by the Salt Throne
The Salt Throne is not yours to swear upon not unless the kingsmoot chooses you
My father wouldve wanted me to rule
Your father does not get to choose The law is clear Perhaps youll win Perhaps youll be the first woman in history to rule the Ironborn And perhaps not
Come in
Im sorry my lady I didnt mean to interrupt
You interrupt nothing
I assume you know why Im here
I will after you tell me
Its about the Lord Commander
The former Lord Commander
Does he have to be
What are you asking
Do you know of any magic that could help him Bring him back
If you want to help him leave him be
Can it be done
There are some with his power
How
I dont know
Have you seen it done
I met a man who came back from the dead but the priest who did it It shouldnt have been possible
But it was It could be now
Not for me
Not for you I saw you drink poison that shouldve killed you I saw you give birth to a demon made of shadows
Everything I believed the great victory I saw in the flames all of it was a lie
You were right all along The Lord never spoke to me
Fuck him then Fuck all of them Im not a devout man obviously Seven Gods drowned gods tree gods its all the same
Im not asking the Lord of Light for helpIm asking the woman who showed me that miracles exist
I never had this gift
Have you ever tried
Easy easy Easy
What do you remember
They stabbed me Olly he put a knife in my heart I shouldnt be here
The lady brought you back
Afterwards after they stabbed you after you died where did you go What did you see
Nothing There was nothing at all
The Lord let you come back for a reason Stannis was not the prince who was promised but someone has to be
Could you give us a moment
You were dead And now youre not Thats completely fucking mad seems to me I can only imagine how it seems to you
I did what I thought was right And I got murdered for it And now Im back Why
I dont know Maybe well never know What does it matter You go on You fight for as long as you can You clean up as much of the shit as you can
I dont know how to do that I thought I did but I failed
Good Now go fail again
They think youre some kind of god The man who returned from the dead
Im not a god
I know that
I saw your pecker What kind of god would have a pecker that small
Your eyes are still brown Is that still you in there
I think so Hold off on burning my body for now
Thats funny You sure thats still you in there
You all right
Yes Yes Im fine
Did I ever tell you I used to think the sea was called the see because it was nothing but water as far as the eye could see
I dont think so
Sea see Theyre spelled different but they sound the same
Yeah they do
It was before I learned how to read obviously
Sam are you going to be sick
Wont be long Well be in the south soon Im excited to see Oldtown Captain says its the most beautiful city in Westeros Are you going to vomit again
No No no no The Citadel doesnt admit women There wont be a place for you there or for Little Sam
I stayed at Castle Black Theres no women allowed there
The Citadel isnt Castle Black I dont have a Jon Snow or a Maester Aemon to help me bend the rules
Ill stay in Oldtown then
By yourself With a baby and no money
So if were not going to Oldtown where are you taking me

Id never do that to the father of my son
Thats my father THREE
The man beside him is Howland Reed Meeras father
Ser Arthur Dayne THREE
The Sword of the Morning
Father said he was the best swordsman he ever saw
Lord Stark
I looked for you on the Trident
We werent there
Your friend the usurper would lie beneath the ground if we had been
The Mad King is dead Rhaegar lies beneath the ground Why werent you there to protect your prince
Our prince wanted us here
Wheres my sister
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come
And now it begins
No Now it ends
Hes better than my father THREE
Far better
But Father beat him THREE

He heard me THREE
Maybe Maybe he heard the wind
He heard me THREE
The past is already written The ink is dry
Whats in that tower I want to go back there THREE
Ive told you many times stay too long where you dont belong and you will never return
Why do I want to return So I can be a cripple again So I can talk to an old man in a tree THREE
You think I wanted to sit here for 1000 years watching the world from a distance as the roots grew through me
So why did you THREE
I was waiting for you
I dont want to be you THREE
I dont blame you You wont be here forever You wont be an old man in a tree But before you leave you must learn
Learn what THREE
Everything
Hey Great Khaleesi Move your ass
Welcome home Khaleesi
Go
What are you doing Take your hands off me I will have your heads
You have made a mistake One you will regret I am the wife of the Great Khal
We know who you are I remember you eating the stallions heart Why didnt you come to us after Khal Drogo died
Because I am Daenerys Stormborn the Breaker of Chains the Queen of Meereen and the Mother of Dragons My place is not here with you
You were the wife of the Great Khal You thought he would conquer the world with you at his side He didnt I was the wife of the Great Khal Khal Savo I thought he would conquer the world with me at his side Youre young We were all young once But we all understand the way things are You will learn as well if you are fortunate enough to stay with us
Where else would I go Every khaleesi becomes Dosh Khaleen
Yes Immediately after the death of their khal But you went out into the world That is forbidden All the khalasars have returned for the Khalar Vezhven They will decide which cities will be sacked and which tribes will be enslaved And now they must decide what to do with Khal Drogos silverhaired widow With luck your place will be here with us Mother of Dragons It is the best you can hope for now
I dont know how you stand it in all that leather
If we could have the room
You look lovely today my dear You really do How you climbed all those steps without breaking a sweat
If youre going to torture me just call them back and get on with it
I am not a torturer
Though it so often is what people deserve
And it does provide answers But theyre usually the wrong answers My job is to find the right answers Do you know how I do that I do it by making people happy Id like to make you happy Vala Thats your name isnt it Vala
Thats all right I know who you are and what youve done Youve done a lot Youve sacrificed your body for a cause which is more than most people do And youve helped the Sons of the Harpy murder the Unsullied and the Second Sons
The Unsullied and the Second Songs are foreign soldiers brought here by a foreign queen to destroy our city and our history
I understand Well that makes perfect sense from your perspective I have a different perspective of course I think its important that you try to see things from my perspective just as I will try to see them from yours Because that is the only way that I can make you and Dom happy That is how you pronounce it Dom Im afraid I dont really speak the language Such a handsome boy Those big brown eyes Good luck keeping the ladies away
Yes youre a true liberator arent you You wont torture me youll just threaten my son
Children are blameless I have never hurt them Your boy is in no immediate danger this I swear to you But between us dear you did conspire to kill the queens soldiers We both know the penalty for that crime How will poor Dom get on without his mother And with his breathing problem
If I tell you anything theyll kill me So either you kill me or they do
Yes from your perspective this is a problem There is a third option though A ship leaving tomorrow for Pentos Ive already booked passage for a woman and her young son Ill even throw in a bag of silver to help you start again
Though Im afraid well have to ask one of our leatherclad friends back in to carry it Far too heavy for me The boat sails at dawn You need to decide now A new life for you and Dom or
What should we do while we wait To pass the time what should we do What should we talk about
You speak 19 languages You must occasionally use some of them to talk about things
You two you spend a great deal of time together What would you be talking about if I werent here
Patrol When I am going on patrol with the Unsullied What we see on patrol Who we captured on patrol
Thats good Thats very good
But thats a report I was thinking more of a conversation A wise man once said the truth history of the world is the history of great conversation in elegant rooms
Who said this
Me Just now All right no conversations Lets play a game
You dont play games either one of you ever
Games are for children
My master Kraznys would sometimes make us play games
There thats a start
Only the girls
Oh no no no Not that of course not that Innocent games fun games drinking games
We do not drink
Until you do
Alright No drinking We can play without drinking Its a wonderful game I invented it Heres how it works I make a statement about your past If Im wrong I drink And if Im right Maybe we cant play without drinking
Oh you took your time
Sorry I was busy learning who funds the Sons of the Harpy Some things you cant rush
You found out
The good masters of Astapor And the wise masters of Yunkai With help from their friends in Volantis
You see You dont even have to worry about the local rebellion We only have to worry about the three rich foreign cities paying for it
We conquered Asatapor and Yunkai once We will do it again and execute the Masters
If the Unsullied march off to reconquer Asatapor and Yunkai who remain to defend the free people of Meereen
If we do not fight them how can we stop them
We cannot The Masters only speak one language They spoke it to me for many years I know it better than my mother tongue If we want them to hear us we must speak it back to them May it be the last thing they ever hear
You may be right
So we will fight them
Possibly
Possibly
Its a conversation
Tell me can the little birds get a message to the good Masters of Astapor the wise Masters of Yunkai the benevolent enslavers of Volantis
Of course Man can be fickle but birds always trust
Your eye looks much better Arthur Hows your mothers jaw
Better
And your father
No ones seen him
And no one will That worked out rather nicely
Will Lord Varys ever come back
I dont think so Do you miss him
He was nice
He called us his little birds He gave us sweets
Its funny you should mention that Guess what I happened to find today Candied plums from Dorne
Now remember if any of your friends like sweets or need help they can always come to me All I need in return are whispers
No need to be afraid This is Ser Gregor Hes friends with all my friends
Run along now
Varyss little birds
Your little birds now your Grace
What did you do to him exactly I havent been able to get a clear answer
Oh a number of things
Does he understand what were saying I mean to the extent that he ever understood complete sentences in the first place
He understands well enough
So tell him to march into the sept and crush the High Sparrows head like a melon
The High Sparrow has hundreds of Faith Militant surrounding him Ser Gregor will cant face them all And he wont have to Hell only have to face one
Has the Faith leveled official charges yet
Not yet
That is one trial by combat I look forward to watching
Dont stop at the city I want little birds in Dorne in Highgarden in the North If someone is planning on making our losses their gains I want to hear it If someone is laughing at the queen who walk naked through the streets covered in shit I want to hear I want to know who they are I want to where they are
As bad as Lord Varys was Varys was Qyburn is worse I told them all I told them Hes arrogant dangerous You dont get thrown out of the Citadel without good reason And no one listened to my advice so here we are
And what hes done to Gregor Clegane is an abomination We never sanctioned this this experiment And I for one think it would be in our best interest to have the beast dest 
Can I help you
Why are you here
My mother
I was invited my dear o help deal with several troublesome issues such as the queens imprisonment
Thank you for bringing it up Its well past time we addressed the abuses I endured
Margaery is the queen You are not the queen because youre not married to the king I do appreciate these things can get a bit confusing in your family
This is a Small Council meeting You have no position on the Small Council
Im Lord Commander of the Kingsguard The Lord Commander of the Kingsguard does have a position on the Small Council
Grand Maester Pycelle would you sanction that statement
Well um I would say Ser Gerold Hightower had a seat on the Mad Kings council Of course that was the Mad King King Robert saw things differently
What about Myrcellas death Uncle Do you consider the murder of your own blood a troublesome issue
The same women who murdered Myrcella have overthrown House Martell and taken control of Dorne Weve got a lot to discuss All of us together
And seeing as you cannot make us leave we best get on with it
No we cannot make you leave And you cannot make us stay Not unless youre gonna have that thing murder us all
Oh your Grace
My mother would like to see her daughters final resting place
Oh Im sorry your Grace Thats not possible Not yet
When will it be possible
When shes fully atoned for her sins
Youve cut off her hair and marched her naked through the streets in front of the whole city That wasnt a full atonement
No She must stand trial before seven septons so we can learn the true extant of her sins
I want you to let her see Myrcellas resting place
I am the king
You are
And what does that mean to you
It means a great deal to me The crown and the faith are the twin pillars of the world Do you know who told me that Your mother
My mother who is unclean My mother who still needs to atone after all youve put her through
How do you think the Mother Above first came to us How did men and women first come to feel the Mothers presence It was through their own mothers There is a great deal of falsehood in Cersei you know that But when she speaks of you the Mothers love outshines it all Her love for you is more real than anything else in this world Because it doesnt come from this world But you know that Youve felt it Youve seen her when she talks to you
Yes
Its a great gift One I never had Envy One more thing for me to atone for
You Grace may I Do you mind Its my knees
Of course
When your mother made her walk of atonement she did it to get back to you
I still dont understand why you want to put her through any more than shes already endured
Its not what I want Its what the gods want They make their will known to us and its up to us to either accept or reject it
Please
If were to be just and good then we accept it all of us even kings A true leader avails himself of the wisest council he can And no one is wiser than the gods
My grandfather once said something similar Except for the part about the gods
The gods worked through him whether he knew it or not As they work through your mother Theres so much good in all of us The best we can do is to help each other bring it out
Who are you
No one
Who were you before you came here
Arya Stark
Tell me about Arya Starks family
Her father was Eddard Stark Her mother was Catelyn Stark She had one sister Sansa and four brothers
Three brothers
Rob Bran Rickon And a halfbrother Jon
And where are they now
They may be dead for all a girl knows
Tell me about The Hound
Also dead
Arya Stark left him to die He was on her list
He was not on her list anymore Shed taken him off it
Why Didnt she want him dead any longer
She did and she did not
She sounds confused
Yes she was
Who else was on Arya Starks funny little list
Cersei Lannister Gregor Clegane Walder Frey
Thats a short list That cant be everyone you want to kill
Are you sure youre not forgetting someone
Which name would you like a girl to speak
If a girl tells me her name I will give her eyes back
A girl has no name
Come
If a girl is truly no one she has nothing to fear
Who are you
No one
The Umbers are a famously loyal house
Famously loyal to the Starks
And you Lord Karstark Your people share blood with the Starks dont they But here we are Times change
When my father became Warden of the North your house refused to pledge their banners
Your father was a cunt
My beloved father the Warden 
Your father was a cunt and thats why you killed him I mightve done the same to my father if he hadnt have done me the favor of dying on his own
My father was poisoned by our enemies
Mmm
Why have you come to Winterfell Lord Umber
The bastard Jon Snow led an army of wildlings past the Wall Were farther north than any of you fuckers Wildlings come down we always have to fight them first I like fighting wildlings been doing it all my life But there are too many of them for us to beat back alone
So now youve come seeking help
We need to help each other The colder it gets the farther South those goat fuckers will roam Wont take them long to get here
You think a horde of wildlings can take Winterfell
If they get Jon Snow leading them maybe He knows this place better than we ever will
Pledge your banners to House Bolton Swear loyalty to me as Warden of the North and we will fight together to destroy the bastard and all his wildling friends
Im not kissing your fucking hand
Traditionally a bannerman kneels before his lord
Im not doing that either
Why would I trust a man who wont honor tradition
Your father honored tradition Knelt for Robb Stark Called him King of the North Was Robb Stark right to trust your father
Then it appears were at a bit of an impasse
Fuck kneeling and fuck oaths Ive got a gift for you
A girl I hope I prefer redheads
A girl aye A wild one
I like them wild
And the boy nice and young The way Karstark likes them
Whos this
Rickon Stark
How do I know thats Rickon Stark
Welcome home Lord Stark
Its time
If you have any last words now is the time
You shouldnt be alive Its not right
Neither was killing me
My mothers still living at White Harbor Could you write her Tell her I died fighting the wildings
I had a choice Lord Commander Betray you or betray the Nights Watch You brought an army of wildlings into our lands An army of muderers and raiders If I had to do it all over knowing where Id end up I pray Id make the right choice again
Im sure you would Ser Alliser
I fought I lost Now I rest But you Lord Snow youll be fighting their battles forever
We should burn the bodies
You should
What do you want me to do with this
Wear it Burn it Whatever you want You have Castle Black
Where you gonna go
South
What are you gonna do
Get warm
I was with you at Hardhome We saw whats out there We know its coming here How can you leave us now
I did everything I could You know that
You swore a vow
Aye I pledged my life to the Nights Watch I gave my life
For all nights to come
They killed me Edd My own brothers You want me to stay here after that
Riders approaching
Open the gate
This is good soup Do you remember those kidney pies Old Nan used to make
With the peas and onions
Mmm
We never should have left Winterfell
Dont you wish we could go back to the day we left I want to scream at myself Dont go you idiot
How could we know
I spent a lot of time thinking about what as ass I was to you I wish I could change everything
We were children
I was awful just admit it
You were occasionally awful Im sure I cant have been great fun Always sulking in the corner while the rest of you played
Can you forgive me
Theres nothing to forgive
Forgive me
All right All right I forgive you
Youd think after thousands of years the Nights Watch would have learned how to make a good ale
Where will you go
Where will we go If I dont watch over you Fathers ghost will come back and murder me
Where will we go
I cant stay here not after what happened
Theres only one place we can go Home
Should we tell the Boltons to pack up and leave
Well take it back from them
I dont have an army
How many wildlings did you save
They didnt come here to serve me
They owe you their lives
You think theyll be safe here if Roose Bolton remains Warden of the North
Sansa
Winterfell is our home Its ours and Aryas and Brans and Rickons Wherever they are it belongs to our family We have to fight for it
Im tired of fighting
Its all Ive done since I left home Ive killed brothers of the Nights Watch Ive killed wildlings Ive killed men that I admire I hanged a boy younger than Bran I fought and I lost
If we dont take back the North well never be safe I want you to help me But Ill do it myself if I have to
My lady
Ser Davos
Will you stay here at Castle Black
I will do as Jon Snow commands
You serve Jon Snow now
Hes the prince that was promised
Forgive me my lady I thought that was Stannis
What happened down there
There was a battle Stannis was defeated
And Shireen What happened to the princess
I saw what happened I saw Stannis forces defeated in the field
My lady Im Ser Davos Seaworth
Weve met before I was Kingsguard to Renly Baratheon Before Renly was assassinated with bloodmagic
Thats in the past now
Yes its in the past It doesnt mean I forget Or forgive He admitted it you know
Who did
Stannis Just before I executed him
The Defender of the Vale
Uncle Petyr
My lord Come and see
I missed your name day Go on
A falcon
A gyrfalcon The greatest and rarest of birds
Last time I saw you Baelish you told me you were taking Sansa Stark home with you to the Fingers
Indeed I was
And yet not long ago we received reports that she has been married to Ramsay Bolton in Winterfell
On our way to the Fingers we were set upon by a large force of Bolton men Seemed to know exactly when we were traveling and exactly whom we were transporting
Do you take me for a fool
Tell me Lord Royce how many people knew of my travel plans with Sansa Stark I shared my intentions with you and no one else
Slander a man in his own home you might find yourself crossing swords with him
Your home is the Vale The Lord of the Vale stands before us And only his judgment concerns me
Shall we throw him through the Moon Door
My lord My lord I have always been faithful to House Arryn To your father to your mother and now to you
Do you believe him Uncle Petyr
Lord Royce has served the Vale well Hes enjoyed a distinguished military career If we could trust his absolute loyalty he would make a capable commander in the wars to come
You can trust my absolute loyalty my lord
I think he deserves one more chance What do you say
Fine
I bring good news My friends in the North tell me Sansa has escaped Winterfell I expect shes headed to Castle Black where her brother serves as Lord Commander But she wont be safe there not with the Boltons after her
Shes my cousin We should help her
That was my instinct as well
Our lord has spoken Gather the Knights of the Vale The time has come to join the fray
You invite the enemy into our city
I did As a clever man once told me We make peace with our enemies not our friends
I dont make peace with the queens enemies I kill the queens enemies
Yes thats the military approach And how has that worked here in Meereen I represent the diplomatic approach
Our queen tried to make peace with the Masters and they tried to murder her TYRION We enter these negotiations with open eyes Trust me My own recent experience with slavery has taught me the horrors of that institution
How many days were you a slave
Long enough to know
Not long enough to understand
I bought this dwarf for a single gold honor And somehow youve risen to the top of the Great Pyramid of Meereen Its most impressive
And now you speak for the Good Masters of AstaporHeres to reversals of fortune
We came here to meet the queen and instead were greeted by a dwarf and a eunuch
Lets make this simple shall we Tell me what you want
We want you to leave Slavers Bay Take your dragons and your mercenaries and go
Queen Daenerys wont stay in Meereen forever Her path takes her westward
When we last met I offered her ships so she could return to Westeros where she belongs She refused them
She refused them because hundreds of thousands of men women and children still lived in chains
As they have since the dawn of time
Not anymore
You think youre a free man now You still follow orders Just because your master has silver hair and tits doesnt mean shes not a master
Friends friends friends please
There have always been those with wealth and power and those with nothing That is the way of the world Im not here to change the way of the world
Slavery is the way of our world
You dont need slaves to make money There havent been slaves in Westeros for hundreds of years and I grew up richer than any of you But our queen recognizes that she erred by abolishing slavery without providing a new system to replace it So here is the queens proposal Slavery will never return to Meereen but she will give the other cities of Slavers Bay time to adjust to the new order
What does that mean
Instead of abolishing slavery overnight we will give you seven years to end the practice
Slaveholders will be compensated for their losses of course at fair prices In exchange you will cut off your support for the Sons of the Harpy
We do not support the Sons of the Harpy
Fine fine but you will cut it off all the same I do hope you accept my friends You will not receive a better offer
Let us sail on the tide of freedom instead of being drowned by it And as a parting gift to our honored guests
Give freedom a chance See if it doesnt taste every bit as good as what came before
My friends Large sorry you wait so fat time
Perhaps I should translate for you
We speak the Common Tongue
Excellent
You met with the slavers today
I did
Our brothers and sister died fighting these scum Now you invite them to our city and drink wine with them
I imagine this room was built so the rulers could intimidate the ruled
But I am not your ruler Im not the Breaker of Chains Im not the Unburnt And I am certainly not the Mother of Dragons
You are a stranger here So why do you represent Meereen in these talks with our enemies
Because our queen chose me as her advisor Until she returns from her travels 
When does she return
Soon You have my word
We dont know you We dont trust you We know Torgo Nudho We fight with him against the Masters We trust him
And that is exactly why Grey Worm took part in these negotiations As commander of the Unsullied he knows hot to defeat the slavers and he knows when it is time to make peace
You have made peace with the slavers
We offered terms
And you Grey Worm You want to drink wine with these men The men who tore us from our mothers arms and sold us at auction like cattle
I am a soldier not a politician But if there is a chance for peace a just peace we should take it
Missandei you know what these men are How can you trust them
I do not trust them I will never trust them
But as a wise man once said We make peace with our enemies not our friends
Do not use me for your lies
Those men respect you
They respect me because they know who I am They know I am loyal
As do I
I am loyal to my queen not you If you betray her work you are my enemy
I am not betraying her work I am trying to save her city
You promised the slavers they could keep slavery
For a short time
Seven years is not a short time for a slave
Youre right Slavery is a horror that should be ended at once War is a horror that should be ended at once I cant do both today
You are wrong to trust these men
I dont trust the Masters I trust their selfinterest Theyre trustworthy if theyre convinced that working with me is in their selfinterest
You dont know them You dont understand them We are not human in their eyes They look at me and see a weapon They look at her and see a whore
They look at me and they see a misshapen little beast Their contempt is their weakness Theyll underestimate us every time and we will use that to our advantage
You will not use them They will use you That is what they do
You all right Why dont you sit and catch your breath
Im fine
I dont think you could ride the dragon 20 years ago maybe
What
Our queen Shes wild you know Dont let her size fool you Its hard enough for me and Im a young man You I dont think your heart could take it
Must make you angry that our queen chose me
Makes me sad Youll disappoint her before long Shell move on
Well all disappoint her before long
We need each other right now After were done needing each other 
Oh I dont want to fight you Jorah the Andal What do I have to gain If I win Im the shit who killed an old man If I lose Im the shit who was killed by an old man
You didnt get much discipline as a child did you
None
The road running through the Horse Gate they call that the godsway
Eastern Market Western Market When Khal Drogo died she was supposed to come here and join the Dosh Khaleen the widows of the dead khals Thats where they would have taken her the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen
What are you doing
Its forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
Isnt it forbidden to sneak into their city and steal their khaleesi
If they spot us and were unarmed well say were traders heading for the Western Market But if they see weapons
Youre asking a dog to hand over his teeth
Theres 100000 of them down there We cant fight our way out We wait till dark and then well find her
Uh
Im very attached to this knife
Dont worry it didnt touch you
You know what happens
I know what happens
Ill do it myself
I should have been born a Dothraki
Come on
My friends We wandered off from the Western Market and got lost Could you show us the way back
What do you sell
Wine Come down to my stall tomorrow Ill give you a cask of the Arbors finest
Youre not merchants
Get the others
Told you Im very attached to this knife
You all right
If they find a body with a stab wound the whole city will be looking for us
Huh
Some of them dont think Dothraki should breed with foreigners They are stupid old women They dont realize that we have always diluted our blood This one is Lhazareen Her Khal found her hiding in a well after he burned her village How old were you
Twelve
A year later she bore her Khal a daughter How did he show his happiness
He broke my ribs
We are not queens here but the khals depend on us for our wisdom Our lives have meaning
That is more than most have
When the khals meet for the Khalar Vezhven tomorrow night I hope they let you live out your days with us The other possibilities are not so pleasant
I need to make water
You cant run from Dothraki You know this
I will never run from Dothraki
Go show her
I needed fresh air The old women stink
They do stink
You must have been very young when your Khal died
Sixteen
Too bad he didnt die sooner
Yes too bad
Is it true you have three dragons
Mmhmm
And they breathe fire
They do Would you like to see them one day
I am Dosh Khaleen I can never leave Vaes Dothrak until I rise as smoke from the pyre on the day I die
No dont hurt her
Shell give us away
We have to go now
We will never get out of Vaes Dothrak alive
All we can do is try
No We can do more than that And youre going to help me
And you Have faith in me Khaleesi Do not betray me
If I were to let you leave right now where would you go What would you seek out
Id go to my brother my husband my family
Of course but for you that means seeking out money finery power Seeking out your family means seeking out sin Im not maligning you I sought those things out too To the exclusion of all else My father was a cobbler He died with I was young and I took over his shop He was a simple man and he made simple shoes But I found that the more work I put into my shoes the more people wanted them Fine leather ornamentation detailing and time Time most of all Dozens of hours spent on a single pair
Quality takes time
Yes I imagine youve worn a year of someones life on your back The highborn liked to cover their feet with my time and they paid well for the privilege I used their money to buy a taste of their lives for myself Each time I indulged I felt myself ascending to something better
And one day you walked through a graveyard and realized it was all for nothing and set out on the path to righteousness Book of the Stranger verse 25
You know
Septa Unella reads it to me At me
Yes yes she does enjoy reading at people Youre close But it wasnt a graveyard It was a feast I bought old fine wine and young pretty girls and invited my friends to come share it all We passed around the wine passed around the women and soon we fell into a stupor I woke before dawn I could barely stand Everyone else was asleep on the couches or on the floor lying in heaps next to their fine clothes The truth of their bodies laid bare I could smell them beneath the incense and the perfume and the fine food that had already started to turn And I saw it with perfect clarity I saw what my sins were The gold I had the wine I drank the women I used my ceaseless struggle to maintain my position It was all part of a story A story I was telling myself about who I was A collection of lies that would disappear in the light The people I was trying to climb away from the beggars in the street the poor they were closer to the truth than I ever was
So what did you do
I left to go and find them I didnt even put on my shoes I walked out the door and never went back
Come lets go and see him
Who
Your brother
Loras Loras
Listen to me You need to stay strong
I cant stay strong I never was strong
You are strong You are the future of our house the future of our family
I dont care about that
Shh Have you have you told them that That you dont care
I just want it to stop Help me
They want me to help you They want me told help tear you down Thats why hes letting me see you I know it is And if either of us give in to what they want then they win
Let them win Just make it stop Please
All right
And now how to avert disaster with our current predicament This High Sparrow I have dealt with fanatics of every description Your Grace Not setting them off thats the most important thing You are beset with enemies both within and without
What are you doing here
I am advising the king on our current predicament
Leave
I am a member of the Small Council The kings small 
Is this a Small Council meeting
Obviously not Im here to lend my wisdom and my support
Thank you for your counsel Grand Maester That will be all for now
Your Grace
Since Ive missed the past several Small Coucil meetings I wanted to speak to you about a few things
Ive been thinking about the High Sparrow
As have we all unfortunately
We need to be careful in dealing with such a man To prevent things from escalating any further We have to be careful not to antagonize him He has Margaery We cant put her at risk Hes dangerous
Look at me What did they do to me To the kings own mother
Its all right Its done Its in the past And of course Margaerys safety is paramount
You dont like Margaery do you
Whether I like her or not is completely unimportant Margaery is the queen Queens must command respect Kings even more so Not just for their own sake but for everyones The High Sparrow has no respect for kings or queens No respect for anything in this world He has no use for the things of this world He want to knock them down and replace them with what With fantasies With beggars in the street With nothing
Mother theres something I want to tell you Something the High Sparrow told me
Youve spoken with him
I promised him I wouldnt tell anyone If he found out I told 
It would be a breach of confidence which he would not take lightly given his constant prattling about the truth I am your mother You can always trust me
The Small Council meeting has been postponed on the kings orders
I would have thought we were perfectly clear the first time Youre not welcome
You once spoke of your respect for our father because he understood the necessity of working with ones rivals
My dear you have been stripped of your dignity and authority publicly shamed and confined to the Red Keep Whats left to work with
Cersei is the mother of the king She has the kings ear and his trust And the king has been speaking regularly with the High Sparrow about Queen Margaery and Ser Loras
The High Sparrow seized power knowing full well wed bicker amongst ourselves instead of seizing it back Here we are Well done to us Now the future of the Seven Kingdoms rest in his dirty peasant hands In a few days hell have a trial for me But before that Queen Margaery will make her walk of atonement Yes Margaery will repent her sins before the good people of the city
Oh no That cannot happen That will not happen
I agree
Youve got the second largest army in Westeros Youll bring them into the city stop queen Margaerys humiliation before it starts and take her back into Crown custody
The king has ordered me to take no action against the High Sparrow or the Faith Militant out of fear for the queens safety
Youll take no action at all When the Tyrell armies come you will stand down Are you expressly forbidden from standing down
No but if the king should call on me 
The whole thing will be over before anyone can call on you to do anything When the High Sparrow is in custody or dead preferably and Margaerys back at Tommens side do you think the king will be angry at the outcome
You hate these fanatics as much as we do You hate what theyve done to your son Do you want Lancel back or have you given him up for good
Of course I want him back
Then stand aside and let the people that took him from you be destroyed
If it doesnt go as planned the Sparrows have many friends in the city Well have civil war Many will die
Many will die no matter what we do Better them than us
They told me you were home and I didnt believe it Theon Greyjoy I said Hes dead Hes been dead a long time He let you go
I escaped
I cant hear you
I escaped
Look at me Look at me Men died trying to rescue you Good men My men
Im sorry
You were my brother Youre a spoiled little cunt but you were my brother and I risked everything for you and you betrayed me
I know I know and Im sorry
Stop saying that
He broke me He broke me into a thousand pieces
I know
You dont know
He send us one of those pieces Thats why I came for you
Why did you come here
Where else could I go
You heard father was dead and thought youd claim the crown
No no I only heard he died after we docked
You happen to show up on Pyke right before the Kingsmoot
I didnt know
You think any Ironborn wants you to be king After what youve done
I dont want to be king
What do you want
I shouldve listened to you Youre the only one 
That doesnt matter anymore Stop crying Look at me Tell me what you want
You should rule the Iron Islands Let me help you
Theyve cleaned you up nicely You know who I am
A lord
Yes A lord Youve seen my banners
The flayed man
Does that worry you at all
You eat them after
No
Then Ive seen worse
You served the Starks
Aye They put me in chains and put a sword at my throat so Ive served them
The Starks have been gone for a long time but you kept protecting Rickon
Hed fetch a good price to the right buyer I served his family a long time Didnt get no wages Way I see it Im owed
Be that as it may Rickons not yours to sell anymore Hes mine So what use could I possibly have for you
I can give you what you want
Are you sure you know what that is
Same thing men always want And when they really want it they give it a bath first
Youre a good talker
I like that
Youre a much better talker than Theon Greyjoy
That so
I had to work hard to get him talking But he talked They all do
He told me everything All about the Stark boys Who helped them escape and how she did it
Open the gate
Sorry about the food Its not what were known for
Thats all right There are more important things
A letter for you Lord Commander
Im not Lord Commander anymore
To the traitor and bastard Jon Snow You allowed thousands of wildlings past the Wall You have betrayed your own kind You have betrayed the North Winterfell is mine bastard Come and see Your brother Rickon is in my dungeon
His direwolfs skin is on my floor Come and see I want my bride back Send her to me bastard and I will not trouble you or your wildling lovers Keep her from me and I will ride north and slaughter every wildling man woman and babe living under your protection You will watch as I skin them living You 
Go on
Its just more of the same
You will watch as my soldiers take turns raping your sister You will watch as my dogs your wild little brother Then I will spoon your eyes from their sockets and let my dogs do the rest Come and see Ramsay Bolton Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North
Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North
His fathers dead Ramsay killed him And now he has Rickon
We dont know that
Yes we do
How many men does he have in his army
I heard him say 5000 once when he was talking about Stanniss attack
How many do you have
That can march and fight 2000 The rest are children and old people
Youre the son of the last true Warden of the North Northern families are loyal Theyll fight for you if you ask
A monster has taken our home and our brother We have to go back to Winterfell and save them both
It is forbidden to spill blood in the sacred city It is forbidden to carry weapons in the sacred city
So we dont spill blood
Well theres always a little blood
Someone crushed his head with a rock
Aggo belonged to my khalaser He served me well He got his head smashed in by a rock Fuck Aggo
Bring in Drogos widow
Who cares about her Shes a midget
I like her
Shes paler than milk
Id like to know what a khaleesi tastes like
Good You can suck my dick
She belongs with the Dosh Khaleen
The Wise Masters of Yunkai want her Theyre offering ten thousand horses In exchange Whats worth more one pink little girl or ten thousand horses
Fuck the Wise Masters in their perfumed asses Ill take their horses for myself
Dont you want to know what I think
Youd rather be sold to slavery Or maybe youd like to show Rhalko here what you taste like
No I dont want either of those things
We dont care what you want This is the Temple of the Dosh Khaleen You have no voice here unless you are Dosh Khaleen Which you are not until we decide you are
I know where I am I have been here before This is where the Dosh Khaleen pronounced my child the Stallion Who Mounts the World
And what happened You trusted a sorceress like a fool Your baby is dead because of you And so is Khal Drogo
This is where Drogo promised to take his khalasar west to where the world ends To ride wooden horses across the Black Salt Sea as no khal has done before He promised to kill the men in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses He swore to me before the Mother of Mountains
And you were dumb enough to believe him
And here now what great matters do the Great Khals discuss Which little villages youll raid how many girls youll get to fuck how many horses youll demand in tribute You are small men None of you are fit to lead the Dothraki But I am So I will
All right No Dosh Khaleen for you Instead well take turns fucking you And then well let our bloodriders fuck you
And If theres anything left of you well give our horses a turn You crazy cunt Did you really think we would serve you
Yes
For you my lady
How far is Moles Town
Sansa Lady Brienne When I heard you had escaped WInterfell I feared the worst You have no idea how happy I am to see you unharmed
Unharmed What are you doing here
I rode north with the Knights of the Vale to come to your aid Theyre encamped at Moat Cailin as we speak
To come to my aid Did you know about Ramsay If you didnt know youre an idiot If you did know youre my enemy
Would you like to hear about our wedding night He never hurt my face He needed my face the face of Ned Starks daughter But the rest of me he did what he liked with the rest of me as long as I could still give him an heir What do you think he did
I cant begin to contemplate 
What do you think he did to me
Lady Sansa asked you a question
He beat you
Yes he enjoyed that What else do you think he did
Sansa I 
What else
Did he cut you
Maybe you did know about Ramsay all along
I didnt know
I thought you knew everyones secrets
I made a mistake a horrible mistake I underestimated a stranger
The other things he did ladies arent supposed to talk about those things but I imagine brothel keepers talk about them all the time I can still feel it I dont mean in my tender heart it still pains me so I can still feel what he did in my body standing here right now
Im so sorry
You said you would protect me
And I will You must believe me when I tell you that I will
I dont believe you anymore I dont need you anymore You cant protect me You wont even be able to protect yourself if I tell Brienne to cut you down And why shouldnt I
Do you want me to beg for my life If thats what you want I will Whatever you ask that is in my power I will do
What if I want you to die here and now
Then I will die
You freed me from the monsters who murdered my family and you gave me to other monsters who murdered my family Go back to Moat Cailin My brother and I will take back the North on our own I never want to see you again
I would do anything to undo whats been done to you I know that I cant Will you allow me to say one more thing before I go Your greatuncle Brynden the Blackfish has gathered what remains of the Tully forces and retaken Riverrun You might consider seeking him out The time may come when you need an army loyal to you
I have an army
Your brothers army
Halfbrother
Youre not ready You should go home before its too late
Youll never be one of us Lady Stark
She has a point
None of the first Faceless Men were born to lords and ladies They began as slaves in the mines of Valyria
Who was the first
He was no one The ManyFaced God taught him how to shed his face and how to give the gift The man taught others in exchange for their service Many served many more gifts were given Soon all the masters and overseers were gone and the Faceless Men fled
Where did they go
Here They founded the Free City of Braavos and built this house These were the faces they wore in life when they were not wearing others The first Faceless Men And now a girl is one of them if a girl desires
A girl has no desires
Who
An actress who calls herself Lady Crane She performs at the theater in Sheelba Square A girl has been given a second chance There will not be a third One way or another a face will be added to the hall
Ahh
Oh murdered by a boar The great big hairy whore He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts and soon I am no more
Oh come Father in bed you must lie I love you Father Please dont die
Shut up you swine Cersei more wine
I feel the winds of winter as they lick across the land And our son alone on that cold cold throne without a guiding hand Who will teach him strength Who will teach him grace To whom will he turn when its time to learn to look darkness in the face
Ned stark will do fine Now bring me more wine
Ooh Ooh whats happened here then
He brought you here Ned Stark cause youre the brightest fellow in the land You should be king of us all and I should be your Hand
We men of the North are right good hands at keeping people lawful
Id ask him for permission but he smells too bloody awful
I die I die And here I now must lie Oh woe Oh no Oh I am about to go
Will you stay on as Joffreys Hand
The Iron Thrones what I demand
You cannot
I can
You will not
I will
You dare not
I dare yes
The line of succession
Whats that mean
The proper progression
Whats that mean
The lawful ascension
Whats that mean
So move along give me my chair and there wont be no more trouble
But we had a deal all done and dusted
Im starting to think you cant be trusted
Save my father
Truly you should Killing the man will do you no good
Save him please
Show him mercy Show the people what a good king should be
Good people you may all relax My fathers friend shall be spared the
Father No Oh father
Worry not All is well I have here a decree from my father Tywin Lannister the richest man youll see He proclaims me Hand of the King The positions mine for life And hes give me permission to take Sansa as my wife
Youll learn that what I lack in height I make up for in appetite
So lets forget about your plight and go rehearse our wedding night
Its a wart Two warts Ive got two fucking warts on my cock
Well dont worry love They usually go away in five or six years
Oh wash this darling It stinks of me
You can do better Bianca dear You must do
I had two lines
There are no small parts You rang very false
I rang very false
What you need love is for someone to ring you true
You werent complaining about me last night
May I get you some wine Lady Crane
Im a rum girl Bobono You need to know that if were going to be intimate
Of course were going to be intimate
Its only a matter of time
To our children
May they have your talent
And your filthy mind
A girl will poison the rum Lady Crane is the only one who drinks it
If a girl could use one of the faces from the hall
A girl is not ready
Shes a good actress
So a man has heard
Seems like a decent woman
Does death only come for the wicked and leave the decent behind
No Who wants her dead
That does not matter The price was paid
The younger actress Shes jealous because Lady Crane is better
A girl must decide if she wants to serve the ManyFaced God
A girl has decided
A servant does not ask questions
No No No
It was you You made the White Walkers
We were at war We were being slaughtered Our sacred trees cut down We needed to defend ourselves
From whom
From you From men
We speak in the presence of the Drowned God In his name we father today to choose a new king as our leader Who makes a claim
I am Yara Greyjoy daughter of Balon Greyjoy King of the Iron Islands I claim the Salt Throne
Weve never had a queen Not once
There are many things weve never done Weve never made our mark upon the world The great lords of Westeros pay us no mind until our little raids buzz through their kingdoms long enough to become a nuisance Then they swat us down They conquer us humiliate us and go right back to forgetting we exist
Aye
We are a sea people
Aye
Our god is a sea god
Aye
When I am queen we will build a fleet that
You shall not be queen
I am not finished
Yes you are A woman will not lead us Not when Balons own male heir has returned
I am Theon Greyjoy last living son of Balon Greyjoy
And she is your rightful ruler Those of you that have sailed under her and there are many of you here you know what she is
Aye
She is a reaver
Aye
She is a warrior
Aye
She is ironborn
Aye
We will find no better leader This is our queen
Im Euron Greyjoy
I claim the Salt Throne
Niece
Nephew Little Theon
Heard you managed to fuck things right into the ground Captured a castle you couldnt keep Got yourself taken prisoner Even heard you have no cock
Explains why you think a woman can be king
When did you return Uncle
A few days ago I had some things to take care of Long overdue
Im glad youre here Now I know what my first act as queen will be To execute the man who killed my father
I did I killed him Threw him right over a rope bridge and watched him fall He was leading us nowhere and we would still be heading there if it werent for me No one loved him No one wanted to follow him He led ius into two wars we couldnt win I apologize to you all for not killing him years ago
That would have been hard to do You werent here Last I heard you were gallivanting around the world having a grand old time
Gallivanting That the sort of thing you start to say once your dick gets chopped off
Did the great lord of Westeros teach you words like that
You were gone Yara was here Being Ironborn Leading Ironborn Getting ready to bring us back to glory
And how will she do that
I will build the largest fleet the world has ever seen
Right idea except Im the one whos going to build the Iron Fleet because Im the one who knows how to use it Ive been all over the world Ive seen more of it than all of you combined And across the sea there is a person who hates the great lords of Westeros just as much as we do Someone with a large army three large dragons and no husband Im going to build that fleet and Im going to gallivant right over and give it to Daenerys Targaryen along with my big cock
Youre going to seduce the Dragon Queen
Im not going to seduce her The Iron Fleet will seduce her And together were going to take the Seven Kingdoms I wasnt born to be king I paid the iron price and here I stand
May Euron your servant be born again from the sea as you were Bless him with salt Bless him with stone Bless him with steel
Listen to the waves Listen to the god He is speaking to us and he says we shall have no king but Euron Greyjoy Let the sea wash your follies and your vanities away Let the old Euron drown Let his lungs fill with seawater
Let the fish eat the scales off his eyes
What is dead may never die but rises again harder and stronger
What is dead may never die
What is dead may never die
Where are my niece and nephew Lets go murder them
They stole our best ships
Wont be enough to save them
Go back to your homes Chop down every tree you can find Quartersaw the timber and start building I want every man bending planks I want every woman spinning flax for sails Build me a thousand ships and I will give you this world
I banished you twice You came back twice And you saved my life So I cant take you back and I cant send you away
You must send me away
Is there a cure
I dont know
How long does it take
I dont know that either But Ive seen what happens when it goes far enough Ill end things before that
Im sorry Im so sorry
Dont be All Ive ever wanted was to serve you Tyrion Lannister was right I love you Ill always love you Goodbye Khaleesi
Do not walk away from your queen Jorah the Andal
You have not been dismissed You pledged yourself to me You swore to obey my commands for the rest of your life
Well I command you to find the cure wherever it is in this world I command you to heal yourself and then return to me When I take the Seven Kingdoms I need you by my side
In the last fortnight since our pact with the Masters how many killings have been carried out by the Sons of the Harpy
None
And how many Masters have been butchered by the free men
Two but that was the day of the pact Since then nothing
So its safe to say that a fragile peace has taken hold
For now
For now is the best we get in our profession
Its not enough
Considering the city was on the brink of civil war Id say its a good start
Its not enough for Meereen to have peace They need to know Daenerys is responsible for it The Sons of the Harpy have a good story Resist the foreign invaders Our queen has an even better story Mother of Dragons Breaker of Chains and all that
The people know who brought them freedom
Yes but do they know who brought them security Who brought about an end to the violence We need someone the people trust someone they know who cannot be bought or influenced
Sounds like quite the hero Where would we find him
Who said anything about him
You stand in the presence of Kinvara High Priestess of the Red Temple of Volantis the Flame of Truth the Light of Wisdom the First Servant of the Lord of Light
Welcome to Meereen
Thats about the extent of my Valyrian
Thank you for travelling all this way I know from personal experience how uncomfortable the journey can be
The truth is we need your help We had hoped that we could somehow persuade you to 
You dont need to persuade me I came to help
Daenerys Stormborn is the one who was promised From the fire she was reborn to remake the world
Yes
She has freed the slaves from their chains and crucified the Masters for their sins
She did indeed
Her dragons are fire made flesh a gift from the Lord of Light But you heard all this before havent you On the Long Bridge of Volantis The dragons will purify nonbelievers by the thousands burning their sins and flesh away
Ideally wed avoid purifying too many nonbelievers The Mother of Dragons has followers of many different faiths
You want your queen to be worshipped and obeyed And while shes gone you want her advisors to be worshipped and obeyed
Id settle for obeyed
I will summon my most eloquent priests They will spread the word Daenerys has been sent to lead the people against the darkness in this war and in the great war still to come
That sounds most excellent 
A man named Stannis Baratheon was anointed as the chosen one by one of your priestesses He too had a glorious destiny He attacked Kings Landing and was soundly defeated by the man standing beside me Last I had heard hed been defeated again this time at Winterfell and this time for good
Wed be most grateful for any support you could provide the queen
I suppose its hard for a fanatic to admit a mistake Isnt that the whole point of being a fanatic Youre always right Everything is the Lords will
Everything is the Lords will But men and women make mistakes Even honest servants of the Lord
And you an honest servant of the lord why should I trust you to know any more than the priestess who counseled Stannis
My friend has a healthy skepticism of religion but we are all loyal supporters of the queen
Everyone is what they are and where they are for a reason Terrible things happen for a reason Take what happened to you Lord Varys when you were a child If not for your mutilation at the hand of a secondrate sorcerer you wouldnt be here helping the Lords Chosen bring his light into the world Knowledge has made you powerful But theres still so much you dont know Do you remember what you heard that night when the sorcerer tossed your parts in the fire You heard a voice call out from the flames Do you remember Should I tell you what the voice said
Should I tell you the name of the one who spoke
We serve the same queen If you are her true friend you have nothing to fear from me
What
He saw me the Night King He saw me THREE
He touched you
I dont know He was close but THREE
He touched you THREE
He knows you are here Hell come for you
But he cant get in THREE
He can now His mark is on you You must leave all of you
Come on Hodor Help me with the sledge
Hodor
Im sorry I didnt mean to THREE
The time has come
The time for what THREE
For you to become me
But am I ready THREE
No
We cant defend the north from the Walkers and the south from the Boltons If we want to survive we need Winterfell and to take Winterfell we need more men
Aside from the Starks and the Boltons the most powerful houses in the North are the Umbers the Karstarks and the Manderlys
The Umbers and the Karstarks have already declared for the Boltons so were not doing so well there
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies They can hang But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay without knowing they had another choice
I beg your pardon my lady but they know that a Stark beheaded their father I dont think we can count on them either
How well do you know the North Ser Davos
Precious little my lady
My father always said Northerners are different More loyal more suspicious of outsiders
They may well be loyal but how many rose up against the Boltons when they betrayed your family I may not know the North but I know men Theyre more or less the same in any corner of the world and even the bravest of them dont want to see their wives and children skinned for a lost cause If Jons going to convince them to fight alongside him they need to believe its a fight they can win
There are more than three other houses in the North Glover Mormont Cerwyn Mazin Hornwood Two dozen more Together they equal all the others We can start small and build
The North remembers They remember the Stark name People will still risk everything for it from White Harbor to Ramsays own door
I dont doubt it But Jon doesnt have the Stark name
No but I do
Jon is every bit as much Ned Starks son as Ramsay is Roose Boltons Ant there are also the Tullys Theyre not Northern but they will back us against the Boltons without question
I didnt know the Tullys still had an army
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed it and retaken Riverrun
How do you know that
Ramsay received a raven before I escaped Winterfell
Thats good The Blackfish is a legend His support would mean a great deal Stark Tully a few more houses almost starts to look like a winning side
Ive sworn to protect you my lady
You heard them We need more men and my uncle has an army
We can send the Blackfish a raven
Cant risk Ramsay intercepting it It has to be you
Ride for Riverrun My uncle will talk to you and youll know how to talk to him
What is it
I dont like leaving you here alone
With Jon
Not him He seems trustworthy A bit brooding perhaps I suppose thats understandable considering The others though Davos and the Red Woman helped a man murder his own brother with blood magic And when Stannis paid for his crime where were they Already out looking for a leader with better prospects And that wildling fellow with the beard 
Jon isnt Tormund Jon isnt Davos the Red Woman or Stannis for that matter Jon is Jon Hes my brother Hell keep me safe I trust him
Then why did you lie to him when he asked you how you learned about Riverrun
New dress
I made it myself Do you like it
Year its I like the wolf bit
Good because I made this for you
I made it like the one Father used to wear As near as I can remember
Thank you Sansa
Youre welcome
Dont knock it down while Im gone
Ill do my best
Good luck
Should we close the gate Lord Commander
Im not the Lord Comman 
Yeah ahem close the bloody gate
We can go home now Hodor Well maybe not home home but somewhere that isnt a cave
Hodor
Eat something that isnt moss I want an egg How do you like em Boiled Fried up with some butter

Meera They found us
Im so sorry
Come with me now
The dead dont rest
Its so green
Oh yes Once you get south of the Riverlands very different sorts of trees start to take over Maple elm beech poplar The odd willow And of course now that summers over youll start seeing the autumn colors coming in Still youll find more green here than anywhere else
Youre nervous Youre a nervous talker
Thats not any better being a nervous mute
I didnt think Id ever come back here after my father made me renounce my title and inheritance and well threaten to kill me if I didnt A person just doesnt feel welcome at that point
And I certainly didnt expect to be introducing him to my family So you know what to tell them
That Little Sam is your baby
Yes now thats very important If he thinks that Little Sam is his grandchild hell take you in Hell get an education Hell learn to read And you can help teach him Huh
What did you tell your family about me
I told them I met you in the North
Did you tell them how far north
Well it wasnt a very large piece of parchment
You didnt tell them where Im really from You didnt tell them Im a wildling
The thing is my father doesnt like wildlings He hoped Id make a man of myself by killing some bloody wildlings so its probably a good subject to avoid if at all possible
I think were here
Sam Oh Sam
Oh hello Mother
I never thought Id see you again You look wonderful
Oh
Talla Gods youre a woman now
Father says I have to marry Symun Fossoway He has yellow teeth
Thats enough Talla
Oh um Mother this is Gilly
Oh my You are lovely
I am happy to know you Lady Tarly
Oh and this this is our son Samwell
Hello little one Its me your grandmother
May I hold him
Yes of course
You have a curious mind I can tell Youll be a scholar like your father
Where is Father And Dickon
Theyre on a hunt Theyll join us for dinner Come inside Such a journey You must be exhausted
Come youll be wanting a bath after all that travel Oh and a dress for dinner You can wear one of mine Whats your color Midnight blue or silver Silver maybe Come You can choose one of my bedrooms if you want
Is there no other way
Youre afraid for her
Of course Im afraid for her It just seems very dangerous
Shell be protected the entire way The Faith Militant are very stern with those who overstep their bounds And Queen Margaery isnt your mother I suspect the gods will predispose the common people to gentleness on her behalf Shes truly opened her heart to them
Shes always been very devoted to the poor and the unfortunate
And now shes devoted to the gods as well Would you like to see her
Have they hurt you Have they mistreated you
No Your Grace
Ive missed you More than you could know
Well be together again soon and everything will be better than it was before
Better how Soon the walk of atonement He says theres no other way
Have you spoken to him at all the High Sparrow
Yes a few times Have you
Yes I have Hes not quite what we thought he was is he
You think Im mad I sound mad
No No you dont You you could never Youre right hes not Hes a lot more
He is Theres something about him His way of looking at the world Its not an easy thing admitting to yourself what you really are Its taken me a while Hes helped me
What are you talking about Youre a good person Youve always been a good person Youre the best person I know
I was just telling him about your devotion to the poor
Ah yes I visited their hovels and I fed them soup and I made sure I was seen doing it I never gave them what they really needed though Ive had lots of time to think about how good I was at seeming good All those stories I told myself about who I was and why I did the things I did There were so many lies in those stories
I dont understand
Its all right It really is Its such a relief to let go of those lies
What about Loras
I love my brother I will always love my brother His soul is pure and perfect His sins dont erase that purity they only obscure it He just needs to atone for them We all do Sooner or later one way or another The gods have a plan for us all
Its hard to walk in this
Its beautiful Youre beautiful
This venison its very tasty Is it from todays hunt
Well no We havent been able to cure that one yet This is last weeks
Oh of course Sorry Long journey
Brought it down from 70 yards One shot
Oh thats a fair distance
So do you do much hunting up at the wall
Oh yes Yes A good amount North of the Wall you dont hunt you dont eat
Mmhmmm Mostly deer or is it elk as well
Rabbits Sometimes squirrels I say we its my friend Jon mostly Sometimes Edd Oh and Gilly Shes shes quite a good hunter as well Um huntress
I imagine its common where youre from We once met a man Lord Umber from Last Hearth wasnt it Randyll who said he taught all his daughters how to hunt
Your father taught you to hunt Our father would never teach us I think our father could learn a thing or two from your father
Thats enough of that
Samwell would you care for more bread
Oh yes Yes please Thank you Mother
Not fat enough already
I travelled south under orders from the Lord Commander He wants me to
I read your letter Youre to be a maester
Yes And once I have my chain Ill return to Castle Black
I thought the Nights Watch might make a man of you Something resembling a man at least You managed to stay soft and fat
Your nose buried in books Spending your life reading about the achievements of better men Ill wager you still cant sit a horse or wield a sword
Randyll to be maester of the Nights Watch is a great honor
He can wield a sword He killed a Thenn He killed a White Walker
Theres no such thing
I saw it with my own eyes on our way down to Castle Black He drove a dagger into the walkers heart He risked his own life to save mine more than once Hes a greater warrior than either of you will ever be
Your way down to Castle Black Where did he kill a white walker Where are you from Howd you come to meet my son
The Nights Watch came to our keep
Where
Gilly
North of the Wall
North of the Wall Youre a Wildling The Seven Kingdoms have waged war against these savages for centuries and here I sit hosting one in my hall thanks to my son See that sword
Its called Heartsbane Its been in our family for 500 years Its Valyrian steel Only a handful of them left in the world Its supposed to go to my firstborn son after I die To him He will never wield that sword If he were to become Lord Tarly of Horn Hill it would be the end of this house I took you for a Moles Town whore when I saw you and I made my peace with that Who else would have him But I overestimated him No It was a wildling whore that seduced my son This you getting back at me boy Hmm Bring that to my table and making me dine with it And you got what you were after didnt you A bastard A halfbreed bastard Your invitation into our home

The lion and the rose are one I thank the gods above
And to you my beauteous bridge I pledge undying love
Hail King Joffrey Hail Queen Margaery
Ill drink a toast to my new queen for there is no one fairer Dear Uncle will you share my joy and be my royal cupbearer
Drink long and deep my noble king from this cup of sweet wine
The last drink he shall ever take And vengeance shall be mine
Poison Murder I gasp I I die
I limp And it was he
that poisoned me My evil Uncle Imp
My firstborn son My golden lion foully falsely slain I pray you found a lasting peace free from strife and pain
Hear my prayer O cruel gods Take my life instead For I cannot face another day when my sweet boy is dead Oh woe Oh grief
Oh darkest day my heart is full of sorrow All hope is lost All joy is gone And there is no tomorrow
What is that I hear and smell Someone Ill soon send to hell
Its time to see if truth they told who said Tywin Lannister shits gold
You beast You beast You killed my wife and now youve taken your fathers life
No worse child ever stained this land
Curse the day I named you
My greatest crime Now I must flee
Then sail across the Narrow Sea to do unto you more treachery
Dont fear the winter
Fear me
Thank you Ladies and gentlemen I give you Bianca Clarenzo
I give you Bobono
I give you Camello
And last but not least sweet Lady Crane
Give this a good beating Shake those fleas out Thats a dear
That crowd was shit
Girl
What are you doing back here
Nothing
I saw you the other day in the audience How many times have you seen this stupid play
Three times
Did you pay
No
I remember when the players came to my village I didnt have any money so I snuck in Just like you Saw the painted faces the costumes listened to the songs cried when the young lovers died in each others arms I ran off and joined them the next day never looked back
Youre very good
My final speech is shit
But to be fair to myself which I always like to be the writings no good
So change it It would all just be farting belching and slapping without you
How would you change it
The queen loves her son more than anything And he was taken from her before she could say goodbye She wouldnt just cry She would be angry She would want to kill the person who did this to her
Whats your name
Mercy
You have very expressive eyes Mercy
Wonderful eyebrows Do you like pretending to be other people
I have to go My fathers waiting for me
Lady Crane they loved you
They were sweet Or drunk Drunkenly sweet
No laugh for Neds death These people are worse than animals
But they loved her They all love her
Yes you are adored by people and animals alike
I do what I can with what Im given
With what youre given
Well I was thinking
Oh were all thinkers now are we
Full to the tits with ideas
I didnt mean
You have ideas I have ideas he has ideas Why should my ideas have any more value than yours simply because Ive been doing this my whole life Who is anyone to judge my work This is my profession I know what Im doing
You have no right to an opinion
Careful of that one She wants you dead
And
As I expected
A shame A girl had many gifts
You promised me
Dont let her suffer
My lord
My lord
My friends the hour has come Madness has overtaken this city and grasped in its claws my children But now we must drive it back under the rocks whence it came Madness has had its day
Forward march
Rich or poor noble or common if we win we must atone Margaery of House Tyrell came to us a sinner She stood before the gods in the holy sept and lied She turned a blind eye to her brothers sins She disgraces her house the king and herself
Company halt Face front Turn
Lord Tyrell
Ser Jaime
Sorry to interrupt Were here for Queen Margaery and Ser Loras Tyrell Give them to us and well be on our way
I dont have the authority to give them to you And you dont have the authority to take them
Lock spears
I speak for King Tommen of House Baratheon First of His Name
The gods dont recognize his authority in this matter
You already insulted one great house It wont happen twice Every last sparrow will die before Margaery walks down that street
To die in the service of the gods would please each and every one of us We yearn for it But there is no call for it today There will be no walk of atonement
Order up
Queen Margaery has already atoned for her sins by bringing another into the true light of the Seven
Together we announce a new age of harmony A holy alliance between the Crown and the Faith
Long live King Tommen and bless you Queen Margaery
The crown and the faith are the twin pillars upon which the world rests Together we will restore the Seven Kingdoms to glory
Whats happening
Hes beaten us Thats whats happening
When you attack the Faith you attack the Crown Anyone who attacks the Crown is unfit to serve as Lord Commander of the Kingsguard
Ive been a member of the Kingsguard since before you were born You dont have to do this You dont have to do anything
I have to answer to the gods
Not when youre sitting in that chair
The Crowns decision on this matter is final
Will I be walking naked in the streets Or will I spend a few months in the sept dungeons first to teach me about the gods mercy
You have served your house and your king faithfully for many years And you will continue to do so But not in this city
Youve lost it
Yes father
Its a castle not a bloody sheep Presumably you still know where it is You didnt lose Riverrun You let the Blackfish take it from you
He surprised us He knows the castle better than anyone
You did lose the Blackfish after the Red Wedding You had him right here in this hall and you let him leave Then when I told you to hunt him down and kill him you couldnt find him Thats what it means to lose something Now hes come back and taken Riverrun
I dont think its fair to blame us
For 300 years we kissed Tully boots swore oaths to them and their stinking fish banners Not again Riverrun is ours Take it back
We dont have the men
Weve got 10 times as many men as the damn Blackfish
The Mallisters have risen against us And the Blackwoods
The Brotherhood Without Banners is rallying the commoners against us raiding our supply trains and camps
Riverrun can withstand a siege for a year
If I want excuses Ill put her in charge Theyre laughing at us All across the Riverlands right down to Kings Landing theyre laughing at us
I hear it in my sleep Im not dead yet unfortunately for you And Ill not leave this world until they all choke on that laughter Take that castle back
Hell never yield Father
Oh hell yield
Youll show him the knife you used to kill Robb Starks child in his whore mothers belly and youll show him the knife you used to open his nieces throat And youll remind him who it was that got married at the Red Wedding in the first place His nephew
Cheer up Lord Edmure Youre going home
Im being sent to deal with the Blackfish Apparently Walder Frey cant manage it on his own because hes 400 years old Sent me with an army to the Riverlands and a siege that could last months
BEtter youre elsewhere at the head of an army than in the sept dungeons
Im not going to the Riverlands
What then
Im going to give Bronn the largest bag of gold anyones ever seen and have him gather the best killers he knows Ill take them to the sept and Ill remove the High Sparrows head and every other sparrow head I can find
You cant
He has our son He stole our son Hes torn our family apart How should we treat people who tear us apart
We should treat them without mercy and we will But if you kill the High Sparrow you wont leave the sept alive And without you this is all for nothing Stand at the head of our army where you belong where Father wanted you Show our men where their loyalties belong Show them what lannisters are what we do to our enemies And take that stupid little castle back because its ours and because you can
Youll stand trial soon I need to he here for you
It will be a trial by combat I have the Mountain Theyve made us both stronger all of them
They have no idea how strong we are No idea what were going to do to them
Weve always been together Well always be together Were the only two people in the world
Why did you help us
The ThreeEyed Raven sent for me
The ThreeEyed Ravens dead
Now he lives again
When I last saw you you were a boy A fearless boy Loved to climb the castle walls frighten his mother
Who are you
Uncle Benjen The last letter Jon wrote me said you had been lost beyond the Wall
I led a ranging party deep into the North to find White Walkers They found us A white walker stabbed me in the gut with a sword of ice Left me there to die To turn The Children found me Stopped the walkers magic from taking hold
How
The same way they made the Walkers in the first place You saw it yourself
Dragonglass A shard of dragonglass plunged into your heart
You are the ThreeEyed Raven now
I didnt have time to learn I cant control anything
You must learn to control it before the Night King comes
Drink
One way or another he will find his way to the world of men When he does you will be there waiting for him And you will be ready
Everything all right
How many days ride to Meereen
A week at best
How many ships will I need to bring my khalasar to Westeros
Dothraki and all their horses the Unsullied the Second Sons 1000 ships easily Probably more
And who has that many
Nobody
Nobody yet
So we ride for Meereen and after that we sail for Westeros What then
I take what is mine
You werent made to sit on a chair in a palance
What was I made for
Youre a conqueror Daenerys Stormborn
Wait here
Im going after her Wait for me here
Every khal who ever lived chose three blood riders to fight beside him and guard his way But I am not a khal I will not choose three blood riders I choose you all
I will ask more of you than any khal has ever asked of his khalassar Will you ride the wooden horses across the black salt sea
Will you kill my enemies in their iron suits and tear down their stone houses
Will you give me the Seven Kingdoms the gift Khal Drogo promised me before the Mother of Mountains
Are you with me
Now and always
Thats it Get it to the top
Steady Steady
Up she goes
Hey come on Put your back into it huh
Here you are son
Oh gentlemen please And you lot come on Come on get it moving Come on come on
In all my days Ive never seen a man swing an ax like that How many men did it take to cut you down
Just one
Ooh he must have been some kind of monster
He was a woman
I think some of the men are a bit afraid of you
Im used to it
When I found you I thought youd been dead for days The way you were stinking already and you had bugs all over you and bone was coming through right there
I was gonna give you a proper burial and then you coughed Oh nearly shit myself I reckoned you were gonna die by the time I loaded you on the wagon but you didnt Now I reckoned youd die a dozen more times over the next few days but you didnt What kept you going
Hate
No theres a reason youre still here
Aye theres a reason Im a big fucker and Im tough to kill
No a reason Gods arent done with you yet
Ive heard that before Man was talking about a different god though
Well maybe he was right I dont know much about the gods
Youre in the wrong line of work
Oh theres plenty of pious sons of bitches who think they know the word of god or gods I dont I dont even know their real names Maybe it is the Seven Or maybe its the old gods Or maybe its the Lord of Light Or maybe theyre all the same fucking thing I dont know What matters I believe is that theres something greater than us And whatever it is its got plans for Sandor Clegane
You didnt know me back in my time You dont know the things Ive done
Ive heard stories
If the gods are real why havent they punished me
They have
Your Grace What are we reading today
The Book of the Mother Your Holiness Chapter three verse 12
Ah As water rounds the stones smoothing 
Smoothing what was jagged so does a womans love calm a mans brute nature A wife salves her husbands wounds a mother sings her son to sleep
You learn quickly There are some who know every verse of the sacred text but dont have a drop of the Mothers mercy in their blood and savages who cant read at all who understand the Fathers wisdom
For year I pretended to love the poor the afflicted I had pity for them but I never loved them They disgusted me
They are hard to love
The poor disgust us because they are us shorn of our illusions They show us what wed look like without our fine clothes Howd we smell without perfume
Can I ask you about a personal matter
Of course
The king mentioned that since your reunion you havent joined him in the marriage bed
No
You have a duty Your Grace To your husband your king your country to the gods themselves
Its just the desires that once drove me no longer do
Congress does not require desire on the womans part only patience The king must have an heir if we are to continue our good work
Forgive me Sometimes the truth path is hard to find
Hard to find and harder still to walk upon But youve made great progress I only pray your grandmother follows your lead
My grandmother
Yes The Queen of Thorns is a remarkable woman a strong woman and an unrepentant sinner You must teach her the new way as she taught you the old Or I fear for her safety body and soul
Does it move or talk I want to speak with you alone
Septa Unella has been my true friend and counselor
Oh this is madness
Youre not in your sanctuary now my dear All I have to do is whistle and my men will stroll in here and bash you about
Grandmother
until I tell them to stop If I tell them to stop You could use a good bashing
Grandmother please
What have they done to you
You marched against the High Sparrow against the Faith
We marched for you
The gods could have punished you and Father but they didnt They showed mercy
And what about your brother What mercy did they show him
Lorass only hope is to confess his crimes and repent If he does the Faith will allow him to return to Highgarden Hell have to renounce his name and title
Have you lost your mind
and live his life as a penitent
He is the heir to Highgarden the future of House Tyrell
He can begin again
As a mindless fanatic
As a free man
You will leave for Highgarden today There is no law that says you must stay here
I am the queen It is my duty to serve my husband the king
But you should leave Grandmother Your place is at home
I will never leave you Never
You must
Go home Find comfort in prayer and good works
The Mother watches over us all
Ill see you soon my dear
Seven blessings to you Grandmother
Shall we pray
We said wed fight with you King Crow when the time comes and we meant it but this isnt what we agreed to These arent White Walkers This isnt an army of the dead This isnt our find
If it werent for him none of us would be here All of you would be meat in the Night Kings army And Id be a pile of charred bones just like Mance
Remember Mances camp It stretched all the way to the horizon And look at us now Look whats left of us And if we lose this were gone Dozens of tribes hundreds of generations Be like we were never there at all Well be the last of the free folk
Thats whatll happen to you if we lose The Boltons the Karstarks the Umbers they know youre here They know that more than half of you are women and children After they finish with me theyll come for you Youre right This isnt your fight You shouldnt have to come to Winterfell with me I shouldnt be asking you Its not the deal we made I need you with me if were gonna beat them and we need to beat them if youre going to survive
The crows killed him because he spoke for the free folk when no other southerners would He died for us If we are not willing to do the same for him were cowards And if thats what we are we deserve to be the last of the free folk
Snow
Are you sure theyll come
Were not clever like you southerners When we say well do something we do it
I heard you were leaving Kings Landing
That is hardly your concern
Your grandson is still a prisoner Youll leave him rotting in a cell
Loras rots in a cell because of you THe High Sparrow rules this city because of you Our two ancient houses face collapse because of you and your stupidity
Youre right I made a terrible mistake I carry it with me every single day
Good
I delivered an army of fanatics onto our doorstep And now we must fight them together We need each other
I wonder if youre the worst person Ive ever met At a certain age its hard to recall But the truly vile do stand out through the years Do you remember the way you smirked at me when my grandson and granddaughter were dragged off to their cells I do Ill never forget it
You love your granddaughter I love my son Its the only truth I know We must defend them
Im leaving this wretched city as fast as I can before that shoeless zealot throws me into one of his cells If youre half as bright as you think you are youll find your way out of here too
Never Ill never leave my son
Whatll you do then You have no support Not anymore Your brothers gone The High Sparrow saw to that The rest of your family have abandoned you The people despise you Youre surrounded by enemies thousands of them Youre going to kill them all by yourself Youve lost Cersei Its the only joy I can find in all this misery
Pick the pace up Keep going
Keep it moving
Now that is a sorry attempt at a siege Someone needs to teach those sad twats how to dig trenches
Someone certainly does
Oh no Not me Im just an upjumped sellsword
Youre an anointed knight Theres quite a difference
Aye knights dont get paid
You have better instincts than any officer in the Lannister army
Thats like saying I have a bigger cock than anyone in the Unsullied army
I expect to command all the Lannister forces before long You can be the right hand I lost
You promised me a lordship and a castle and a highborn beauty for a wife
And youll get all three A Lannister always
Dont say it Dont fucking say it
Come out and fight us Blackfish Yield the castle or well hang him
This is your last warning Yield the castle
You think I wont do it old man
I sliced your nieces throat from ear to ear And where were you Running and hiding like a fucking coward Yield the castle or I cut his throat
Go on then Cut his throat
Lothar is it
Ser Jaime We didnt know you were coming
Cause you didnt set up a proper perimeter You just allowed 8000 men to approach unchallenged
Good thing were friends or wed be fucking you in the ass right now
Have Lord Edmure bathed and fed
Whoa whoa
Walder
Edmure is a prisoner of House Frey
Only a fool makes threats hes not prepared to carry out Now lets say I threatened to hit you unless you shut your mouth but you kept talking What do you think Id do
I dont give a rats
Im here by the kings command to take back this castle Have him bathed and fed Unless youd like to take his place
Apologies Ser Jaime
Do as he says
The siege is now under my command The next time the Blackfish looks out from those ramparts hell see an army at his gates not whatever this is
Have your lads start digging perimeter trenches Set pickets every hundred yards And work doubletime on those siege towers and trebuchets
Those are our siege towers
As I said the siege is under my command If thats not to your liking go home
Get word to the Blackfish I want a parley
A parley or a fight
Hes an old man
Youve got one hand My moneys on the old boy
Lady Mormont
Welcome to Bear Island
I remember when you were born my lady You were named for my Aunt Lyanna It was said she was a great beauty Im sure you will be too
I doubt it My mother wasnt a great beauty or any other kind of beauty She was a great warrior though She died fighting for your brother Robb
I served under your uncle at Castle Black Lady Lyanna He was also a great warrior and an honorable man I was his steward In fact
I think weve had enough small talk What are you here
Stannis Baratheon garrisoned at Castle Black before he marched on Winterfell and was killed He showed me the letter you wrote to him when he petitioned for men It said
I remember what it said Bear Island knows no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark
Robb is gone but House Stark is not And it needs your support now more than ever Ive come with my sister to ask for House Mormonts allegiance
As far as I understand youre a Snow and Lady Sansa is a Bolton Or is she a Lannister Ive heard conflicting reports
I did what I had to do to survive my lady But I am a Stark I will always be a Stark
If you say so In any case you dont just want my allegiance You want my fighting men
Ramsay Bolton cannot be allowed to keep Winterfell my lady It is our duty to stop him Even more so because he holds our brother Rickon Stark as prisoner What you have to understand my lady is that
I understand that Im responsible for Bear Island and all who live here So why should I sacrifice one more Mormont life for someone elses war
If it please my lady I understand how you feel
I dont know you Ser 
Davos my lady of House Seaworth
You neednt ask your maester about my house Its rather new
All right Ser Davos of House Seaworth How is it you understand how I feel
You never thought youd find yourself in your position Being responsible for so many lives at such a young age I never thought Id be in my position I was a crabbers son then I was a smuggler And now I found myself addressing the lady of a great house in time of war But Im here because this isnt someone elses war Its our war
Go on Ser Davos
Your uncle Lord Commander Mormont made that man his steward He chose Jon to be his successor because he knew had the courage to do what was right even if it meant giving his life Because Jeor Mormont and Jon Snow both understood that the real war isnt between a few squabbling houses Its between the living and the dead And make no mistake my lady the dead are coming
Is this true
Your uncle fought them at the Fist of the First Men I fought them at Hardhome We both lost
As long as the Boltons hold Winterfell the North is divided And a divided North wont stand a chance against the Night King You want to protect your people my lady I understand But theres no hiding from this We have to fight and we need to do it together
House Mormont has kept faith with House Stark for 1000 years We will not break faith today
Thank you my lady How many fighting men can we expect
62
62
We are not a large house but were a proud one And every man from Bear Island fights with the strength of 10 mainlanders
If theyre half as ferocious as their lady the Boltons are doomed
Kingslayer
Blackfish
I assume youre here to fulfill the vow you gave my niece I dont see Sansa and Arya
I dont have them
Pity Do you wish to resume your captivity
Then why are you here
You know why Im here This castle belongs to House Frey Youre trespassing In the name of King Tommen I order you to surrender or
Or youll kill Edmure
My nephews marked for death no matter what Hang him and be done with it
It wont stop with Edmure Youll force me to storm the castle Hundreds will die
Hundreds of mine Thousands of yours If you can breach the walls
Well breach them and kill every last one of you But if you surrender Ill spare the lives of your men On my honor
Your honor Bargaining with oathbreakers is like building on quicksand
The war is over ser Why sacrifice living men to a lost cause
As long as Im standing the war is not over This is my home I was born in this castle and Im ready to die in it So you can either attack or try to starve us out We have enough provisions for two years Do you have two years Kingslayer
You clearly have no intention of saving your mens lives Why did you come to treat with me
Sieges are dull And I wanted to see you in person get the measure of you
Well now you have
Aye now I have Im disappointed
The answer is no
Lord Glover if you could just hear us out
Ive heard enough Weve only just taken back this castle from the Ironborn The Boltons helped us do it Now you want me to fight against them I could be skinned for even talking to you
The Boltons are traitors Roose Bolton
Have other northern houses pledged to fight for you
House Mormont
And
We sent raven to Houses Manderly
I dont care about ravens Youre asking me to join your army Who is fighting in this army
The bulk of the force is made up of wildlings
Then the rumors are true I didnt dare believe them I received you out of respect for your father Now I would like you to leave House Glover will not abandon its ancestral home to fight alongside wildlings
Lord Glover
Theres nothing else to say
I would remind you that House Glover is pledged to House Stark Sworn to answer when called upon
Yes my family served House Stark for centuries We wept when we heard of your fathers death When my brother was lord of this castle he answered Robbs call and hailed him King in the North
And where was King Robb when the Ironborn attacked this castle When they threw my wife and children in prison and brutalized and killed our subjects Taking up with a foreign whore Getting himself and those who followed him killed
I served House Stark once but House Stark is dead
Why did we have to come here
Some of us still like it Have a drink at least
I dont want one
Dont go far love
Ill find you in a bit
Nothing on the Iron Islands has an ass like that Doesnt interest you anymore
Im sorry I wont joke about it Ill never hurt you little brother Dont you know that
You think Uncle Eurons hunting for us
Of course he is As long as were alive were a threat
Hell find us
Its a great big world and we have fast ships Drink
I dont want any
I dont care what you want Drink
Drink it all
Youre Ironborn Theon I know youve had some bad years
Some bad years
But Im tired of watching you cower like a beat dog Drink the goddamn ale
Now listen to me I need you The real Theon Greyjoy not this rat shit pretender Can you find him for me Drink
You escaped do you hear me You got away and youre never going back Well get justice for you
If I got justice my burnt body would hang over the gates of Winterfell
Fuck justice then Well get revenge Drink
Listen to me If youre so broken that theres no coming back take a knife and cut your wrists End it But if youre staying Theon I need you Were gonna sail to Meereen Were gonna make a pact with this Dragon Queen And were gonna take back the Iron Islands
Are you with me Are you really with me
Now since its my last night ashore for a long while Im gonna go fuck the tits off this one
Stannis camped here on his way to Winterfell
And thats a good thing
He was the most experienced commander in Westeros He chose this place for a reason Those mountains are a natural fortification Theres a stream down there for the horses
Were not staying here long Another storm could hit any day
Aye the snows defeated Stannis as much as the Boltons did
We have to march on Winterfell now while we still can
2000 Wildlings 200 Hornwoods 143 Mazins
62 Mormonts
Its not what wed hoped for But we still have a chance if were careful and smart
For fucks sake
So hes your most trusted advisor now Because he secured 62 men from a ten year old
Ser Davos is the reason Im standing here talking to you and he served Stannis for years
Stannis who lost the Blackwater who murdered his own brother who doesnt have a head
Its not enough We need more men
Theres no time
If we went down to Castle Cerwyn I know that Lord
We fight with the army we have
Friends this is not worth fighting over
Thisll be it now Right now we dont need to be fighting
Who the fuck are you
Hold on
Yeah who the fuck are you
I was a soldier once All my superiors thought I was brave I wasnt I mean I never ran from a fight Only because I was afraid my friends would see I was afraid Thats all I was a coward We followed orders no matter the orders Burn that village Fine Im your arsonist Steal that farmers crops Good Im your thief Kill those young lads so they wont take up arms against us Im your murderer I remember once a woman screaming at us calling us animals as we dragged her son from their hut But we werent animals Animals are true to their nature and we had betrayed ours I cut that young boys throat myself as his mother screamed and my friends held her back
That night I felt such shame Shame was so heavy on me I couldnt eat I couldnt sleep
All I could do was stare into that dark sky and listen to that mother screaming her sons name Ill hear her screaming the rest of my life
Now I know I can never bring that lad back All I can do with time Ive got left is bring a little goodness into the world Thats all any of us can do isnt it Never too late to stop robbing people to stop killing people Start helping people
Its never too late to come back
And its not about waiting for the gods to answer your prayers Its not even about the gods Its about you Learning you have to answer your prayers yourself
Seven save you friends How can we help you
What are you doing here
Well were talking about life You
Protecting the people
Well we thank you for your protection Who are you protecting us from
Do you have any horses
No horses No gold No steel
Food then Protecting the people is hungry work
Im sure it is Youre welcome to stay for supper but we have hungry mouths here
Stay safe The night is dark and full of terrors
Seven save you friends
Im a fucking septon What was I supposed to say
They dont believe in your Seven Theyre from the Brotherhood They follow the Red God
Aye well all are welcome here Anyway we got nothing for them
Sure you do Youve got food youve got steel even if you say you dont And youve got women
What do you want to do Fight them Kill them
Itd be you against all of them I mean these people dont know how to fight
You do
Im done with fighting
Even if its to protect yourself
Violence is a disease You dont cure a disease by spreading it to more people
You dont cure it by dying either
Youve done enough work for one day Come on up for some supper
Its gonna be a cold night Well need firewood
Ill save you a bowl of stew Might even have some ale hidden away
Hes not a lying man He says the Iron Fleets in Slavers Bay Im inclined to believe him Im not going anywhere near those mad fuckers
Youre Westerosi
What do you care
I want to book passage home
You Cant afford it
Whered you steal this from
Why do you care
We leave in two days You can have a hammock in steerage
I want a cabin And well leave at dawn
See you at sunrise
My son My firstborn son My child king hush Listen to the gods for you they sing Fight no more sweet child Your wars are won The wolves are buried and the false stag done Shut your blue eyes my love Let the crown fall The Father above beckons you into his hall In Seventh Heaven Ill see you once more But now I seek vengeance on Sansa the whore and my brother the Imp who killed his own king Born amongst lions our curse from within I will slay him I swear With noose or with knife though it take me a fortnight a moon or my life
Youre good at that Where did you learn
Im a jealous woman Ive always liked bad men and theyve always liked me Theyd come home wherever home was that night stinking of some whores perfume
So wed fight and Id put a hole in them And then Id feel terrible so Id patch them up I got good at patching them up
And good at putting holes in them
And that
What happened to the actress The one who wanted you dead
Bianca
Shell have a hard time finding work as an actress after what I did to her face
Mmm
I never did learn to cook But eat Eat You need it The company is moving on to Pentos soon You should come with us
I cant
Why not Got a feeling youd be good at this sort of work And besides we need a new actress
I dont think I could remember all of the lines
Come with us Whats left for you here
You wouldnt be safe Not while shes looking for me

She doesnt have a name
Where will you go
Essos is east and Westeros is west But whats west of Westeros
I dont know
Nobody does Thats where all the maps stop
The edge of the world maybe
Id like to see that
Whats that
Milk of the poppy
I dont want any
Sleep is the only way youll heal Trust me if my soup didnt kill you nothing will
Thing about Gatins right is he used to be pretty
I was a famous kisser You lads know how to kiss proper
Course we do
This is for masters this technique Youre not ready
Im ready
He says hes ready
All right
Now pay attention You put your left hand on the back of the ladys head

Fuck you
Those are your last words fuck you Come on you can do better
Cunt
Youre shit at dying you know that
From the fire she was reborn to remake the world Daenerys is a gift from the Lord of Light to her children If we are steadfast in our love for the Queen and her faithful advisors no man will ever lock us in chains again
Id call that a successful gambit
Would you
Look around The city has come back to life
You made a pact with fanatics
I did and it worked
If you shaved your beard with a straight razor youd say the razor worked That doesnt mean it wont cut your throat
Spoken like a man who has never had to shave
Im going to miss you
I know
I hope youre right about this expedition of yours
If I dont return youll know I was wrong
We need friends in Westeros And we need ships
Most of all we need our queen
Shell come back She has to My hearts been broken too many times already
Ill walk the rest of the way myself I cant go off on a secret mission in the company of the most famous dwarf in the city
Varys
The most famous dwarf in the world
Your Grace several members of the Faith Militant have been permitted entry to the Red Keep
Have been permitted Thats rather a tortured way of putting it
They demand to see you Your Grace
Who permitted them inside the Red Keep
The king is aware of their presence
He is Your Grace Hes currently in his chambers at prayer
Your Grace His Holiness the High Septon wishes to speak with you at the Great Sept of Baelor
His Holiness the High Septon is welcome to see me here in the Red Keep
Your Grace this is not a request
It is a request Cousin Lancel You are asking me for something Im refusing
The High Septon commands you Are you sure you want to refuse him
He promised me I could stay in the Red Keep until my trial
He made no such promises If you refuse to come of your own free will
Get out
Move aside ser
Order your man to step aside or there will be violence
I choose violence
Please tell His High Holiness hes always welcome to visit
Looks like a siege my lady
You have a keen military mind Pod
My lady My lady
Who goes there State your business
My name is Brienne of Tarth Please inform Ser Jaime Lannister Ive come to speak with him Tell him I have his sword
Getting a bit old to be a squire arent we
Podrick fucking Payne I thought youd be dead by now
Not yet
Are they in there
Mmhmm
You think theyre fucking
What No
Why not Id fuck her Youd fuck her wouldnt you
Im her squire
Oh Well hed fuck her thats for sure And shes fuck him dont you think The way she looks at him The way all women look at him is frankly irritating I preferred working with the little brother on that account Come on youre the one with the magic cock
You must have shown it to her by now
Shes training me to fight
Is she Oh
An hour in the morning and hour at night Every day
Then how come an old cunt like me can still sneak up and murder you
Well thats a different sort of fighting
Now thats the truth isnt it You want to learn that sort of fighting
All right lets start with your footwork
Show me your stance
Now listen to me Pod See how your feet are about a yard apart
Lesson number one assume everyone wants to hit you Cause they do Pod Everyone wants to hit a fucking squire Do it again Come on dont sulk
I never thought youd find her I just assumed Sansa was dead
Why would you assume that
In my experience girls like her dont live very long
I dont think you know many girls like her
Well Im proud of you I am You fulfilled your oath to Catelyn Stark against all odds
Of course my sister wants Sansa dead The girl is still a suspect in Joffreys murder so there is that complication What the hell are you doing here
Ive come for the Blackfish
Youre welcome to have him
Lady Sansa desires to take her ancestral seat back from the Boltons and assume her rightful position as Lady of Winterfell
With what army does she plan on taking Winterfell
The Tully army
Theyre a bit occupied at the moment I was sent here to reclaim Riverrun currently defended by the Tully rebels so you can see the conundrum
The Tullys are rebels because theyre fighting for their home
Riverrun was granted to the Freys by royal decree
As a reward for betraying Robb Stark and slaughtering his family
Exactly
We shouldnt argue about politics
Youre a knight Ser Jaime I know there is honor in you Ive seen it myself
Im a Lannister Dont ask me to betray my own house
I do no such thing Take Riverrun without bloodshed Ride south with your mission complete and your army intact
What do you propose
Allow me to enter Riverrun under a flag of truce Let me try to persuade the Blackfish to give up the castle
Why would he abandon his ancestral home
Because youll allow him to lead the Tully forces safely north
Have you ever met the Blackfish
No
Hes even more stubborn than you are
All right Try to talk some sense into the old goat He wont listen but his men might Not everybody wants to die for someone elses home
I need your word If I persuade him to abandon the castle youll grant us safe passage north
You have my word You have until nightfall
You gave it to me for a purpose Ive achieved that purpose
Its yours It will always be yours
one last thing Ser Jaime
Yes Lady Brienne
Should I fail to persuade the Blackfish to surrender and if you attack the castle honor compels me to fight for Sansas kin
Of course it does
To fight you
Lets hope it doesnt come to that
Ive said no three times already
I have a signed letter from your niece Sansa Stark
I havent seen her since she was a child I dont know her signature I dont know you And I will not surrender
Double the guards tonight BRYNDEL ingslayer wants to try us I can feel it
As I have said my name is
Yes Brienne of Tarth I know your father A good man
He always spoke highly of you
And if he were here now Id tell him the same Im telling you
If you think Im abandoning my familys seat on the Kingslayers word of honor youre a bloody fool
Riverrun cannot stand against the Lannisters and the Freys
We can stand longer than your onehanded friend thinks we can
Hes not my friend
No
Who gave you permission to cross the siege line and enter the castle Who gave you that sword with the gold lion on the pommel
Ser Jaime kept his word to your niece Catelyn Stark He sent me to find Sansa to help her as Catelyn wanted He gave me this sword to protect her That is what I have done and I will continue to do until the day I die
Shes exactly like her mother
I dont have enough men to help her take Winterfell
You have more than she does
She wants her home back I understand that But this is my home And if Jaime Lannister wants it he can bloody well take it the way everyone else does
Find the maester We need to get a raven north to Sansa
What should I write
Tell her I failed
Theres to be a royal announcement
There is
Why wasnt I informed
There is to be a royal announcement in the throne room at this very moment
Where are you going
To stand by my son
Your place is in the gallery with the other ladies of the court
Lords and ladies the Faith and the Crown are the two pillars that hold up this world One collapses so does the other The Father judges us all If you break his laws you will be punished After conferring with His Holiness the High Septon we have determined that Loras Tyrell and Cersei lannisters trial will be held in the Great Sept of Baelor on the first day of the Festival of the Mother
Furthermore after much prayer and reflection the Crown has decided that from this day forward trial by combat will be forbidden throughout the Seven Kingdoms The tradition is a brutish one a scheme devised by corrupt rulers in order to avoid true judgment from the gods Cersei Lannister and Loras Tyrell will stand trial before seven septons as it was in the earliest days of the Faith Seven blessings to all
Seven blessings
Your Grace that old rumor you told me about My little birds investigated
And Was it just a rumor or something more
More Much more
You seem happy
I am happy You should both be as well Not so long ago this city was ready to devour itself
Now its like a man reborn
I will be happy when our queen returns
Why dont you drink Why dont either of you ever drink
Unsullied never drink
Why not
Rules
And who made these rules Your former masters
Those miserable old shits didnt want you to be human Have a drink with me
And you Whats your excuse
I have tried wine before It made me feel funny
Thats how you know its working
Heres to our queen Anyone not drinking is disrespecting our queen
To Daenerys Stormborn Mother of Dragons Breaker of Chains long may she reign GREY WORM
Long may she reign
Do you like it
Tastes like it has turned
Yes yes Fermentation One day after our queen has taken the Seven Kingdoms Id like to have my own vineyard Make my own wine The Imps Delight Only my close friends could drink it
Tell me a joke Missandei of Naath
I do not know any jokes
Grey worm
Right Three lords walk into a tavern a Stark a Martell and a Lannister They order ale
but when the barkeep brings them over each of them finds a fly in his cup The Lannister outraged shoves the cup aside and demands another The Martell plucks the fly out and swallows it whole The Stark reaches into his cup pulls out the fly and shouts Spit it out you see shit Spit it out
Its funnier in Westeros
The Starks and the lannisters i thought these were enemies
Yes
A joke is like a story Torgo Nudho Not a true story necessarily
A story thats supposed to make you laugh ideally Not at the moment perhaps
Missandei do you like the wine
I do
Tell a joke
Two translators are on a sinking ship
The first says Do you know how to swim The second says No but I can shout for help in 19 languages TYRION Ah
That is the worst joke I ever heard
You dont even know what a joke is
I am soldier all my life You think I never hear joke
You lied to us
I make joke
More jokes
I once walked into a brothel with a honeycomb and a jackass The madam says
The Masters have come for their property
Lord Edmure
I apologize for the way the Freys treated you A man of your birth deserved better You have my word youll be properly fed and clothes from now on
I have your word
Oh good Good thats thats a fine thing My uncle will never surrender the castle ser Whatever game youre playing
The Blackfish is an old man A good death is all he can hope for But you you have a child now Ive heard A son you sired on your wedding night Youre a potent man
A son Ive never met born of a wife that I havent seen since our first night together
You should be with them both I can arrange that you realize Comfortable rooms for you at Casterly Rock A tutor for your boy knights to train him to fight and to ride And when he comes of age hell have a keep of his own
Do you imagine yourself a decent person Is that it After youve massacred my family Kept me in a cell for years Stolen our lands
Ill remind you that our houses are at war Im sorry if this conflict has inconvenienced you but rebelling against the Crown does have consequences
Says the man who shoved his sword through his kings back
Did I give you the impression that this was a negotiation Its not
You understand On some level you understand that youre an evil man
Ill leave the judgments to the gods
Well that is convenient for you Youre a finelooking fellow arent you
Your square jaw your golden armor Tell me I want to know I truly do How do you live with yourself All of us have to believe that were decent dont we You have to sleep at night How do you tell yourself that youre decent after everything that youve done
I was your sisters prisoner once She hit me on the head with a rock if I remember correctly
Yeah She should have killed you
Perhaps but she didnt Catelyn Stark hated me just like you hate me But I didnt hate her I admired her Far more than her husband or her son
Do you think I care whom you admire and whom you dont
No I dont but Im telling you anyway because youre my prisoner You dont have a choice The love she had for her children I was a little awed by it Reminded me of my sister
Oh Oh I see Youre a madman
Im not here to trade insults Your sister was a strong
Dont talk about Cat
Ill talk about whomever I want
She loved her children I suppose all mothers do but Catelyn and Cersei theres a fierceness you dont often see
Theyd do anything to protect their babies
Start a war Burn cities to ash Free their worst enemies The things we do for love
You didnt come here to talk about our sisters
Thats exactly why I came here I love Cersei You can laugh at that if you want You can sneer It doesnt matter She needs me And to get back to her I have to take Riverrun Ill send for your baby boy
And Ill launch him into Riverrun with a catapult Because you dont matter to me Lord Edmure Your son doesnt matter to me The people in the castle dont matter to me Only Cersei And if I have to slaughter every Tully who ever lived to get back to her thats what Ill do
Who goes there
Edmure Tully son of Hoster Tully and the rightful Lord of Riverrun I demand entry
Dont let him in
Hes the Lord of Riverrun I have to obey his commands
Hes been their captive ever since they murdered his king at the Red Wedding Why do you think the people who murdered his king at the Red Wedding would decide to let him come home Because its a trap you idiot Dont let him in
Hes my lord my lord Ive sworn to serve the Lord of Riverrun and obey his commands
Youre not obeying Edmures commands Youre obeying the fucking Kinglsayers commands
I demand entry
My lord has given an order
WIth a knife to his throat That is not a valid order
Lower the drawbridge and open the gate for Lord Ed
Ill have your head before I surrender Riverrun
You are not lord of this castle my lord
Lower the drawbridge
Aye ser
If youre wrong were just surrendered our most valuable prisoner
Welcome home my lord
Command all the forces within the castle to lay down their arms Open the gates
My lord
Your lord has given a command
Find the Blackfish Put him in irons and hand him over to the Freys
Find him
Go on
Come with us
Ive run before from the Red Wedding Im not running again This is my family home
Your family is in the North Come with us Dont die for pride when you can fight for your blood
Youll serve Sansa far better than I ever could
Go on now
I havent had a proper sword fight in years I expect Ill make a damn fool of myself
We found the Blackfish my lord
Good Bring him to me
He died fighting my lord
I was wrong I admit it
That changes nothing
The Unsullied could mount a defense off the beachhead If the slavers forces
No more talking from you Your talking gave us this
And I have acknowledged that Im trying
Youre trying to tell me what the army should do You do not know what the army should do
All right what should the army do
Well not go to the beach If we go to the beach the Masters will take the pyramid The pyramid is the only place in the city we can defend We stay here
And then
We wait for them to come to us Then we fight them
Clegane
What the fuck you doing here
Chasing them You
Hanging them
Any particular reason
Theyre our men Or they were They attacked a nearby sept and murdered the villagers Why do you want them
Same reason I was helping build it They killed a friend of mine
Youve got friends
Not anymore Theyre mine
Its the Brotherhoods good name theyve dragged through the dirt
Fuck your name Theyre mine I killed you once before Dondarrion Happy to do it again
Drop that arrow you bloody girl
Tougher girls than you have tried to kill me
You can have one of them
Two
No no no
Were not butchers We hang them
hanging All over in an instant Wheres the punishment in that
They die
We all bloody die
Except this one here Ill only gut one of them
No
Ill chop off one hand
We gave you two of the three out of respect for your loss Thats generous
Bunch of nancies
There was a time I would have killed all seven of you just to gut these three
Youre getting old Clegane
Hes not
Please dont Ill give you anything
Got anything to eat
Enjoying yourself
I prefer chicken
You ought to join us We could use you
I tried joining Didnt work out for me
Clegane were here for a reason The Lord of Light is keeping Beric alive for a reason He gave a failed drunk priest the power to bring him back for a reason We are part of something larger than ourselves
Lots of horrible shit in this world gets done for something larger than ourselves
Cold winds are rising in the North
And youre going to go stop them
We need good men to help us
Last time you saw me you wanted to execute me
True enough But the Lord of Light gave you the power to defeat me Why
I beat you because Im better than you Beric I was better than you before you started yammering on about the Lord and Im better than you now
Aye youre probably right Youre a fighter You were born a fighter You walked away from the fight How did that go Good and bad young and old the things were fighting will destroy them all alike You can still help a lot more than youve harmed Clegane its not too late for you
Lady Crane
Lady Crane
If youd have done your job she would have died painlessly
Instead
The ManyFaced God was promised a name He must always receive what is his You cant change that I cant change that No one can And now hes been promised another name
It will all be over soon On your knees or on your feet
Havent we been through this already That wont help you
You told her to kill me
Yes But here you are And there she is
Finally a girl is no one
Despite appearances I think youll find the citys on the rise
Perhaps we should take shelter
The city is on the rise
Meereen is strong Commerce has returned to the markets The people are behind you
Well not all the people of course No ruler that ever lived had the support of all the people But the rebirth of Meereen is the cause of this violence The Masters cannot let Meereen succeed Because if Meereen succeeds a city without slavery a city without Masters
it proves that no one needs a Master
Good Shall we begin
Do we have a plan
I will crucify the Masters I will set their fleets afire kill every last one of their soldiers and return their cities to the dirt That is my plan
You dont approve
You once told me you knew what your father was Did you know his plans for Kings Landing when the Lannister armies were at his gates
Probably not Well he told my brother and Jaime told me He had caches of wildfire hidden under the Red Keep the Guildhalls the Sept of Baelor all the major thoroughfares He would have burned every one of his citizens The loyal ones and the trators Every man woman and child Thats why Jaime killed him
This is entirely different
Youre talking about destroying cities Its not entirely different Id like to suggest an alternate approach
Once before I offered you peace If you had not been so arrogant you could have returned to your homeland with a fleet of ships Instead you will flee Slavers Bay on foot like the beggar queen you are
We are here to discuss terms of surrender not to trade insults
The terms are simple You and your foreign friends will abandon the Great Pyramid and the city of Meereen The Unsullied you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The translator you stole from Kraznys mo Nakloz will remain to be sold again to the highest bidder The dragons beneath the Great Pyramid will be slaughtered
We obviously didnt communicate clearly Were here to discuss your surrender not mine
I imagine its difficult adjust to the new reality Your reign is over
My reign has just begun
Dracarys
You men have a choice
fight and die for the masters who would never fight and die for you or go home to your families
Thank you for the armada Our queen does love ships Now last time we spoke we made a pact You violated that pact You declared war upon us Though our queen does have a forgiving nature this cannot be forgiven
Our queen insists that one of you must die as punishment for your crimes
It always seems a bit abstract doesnt it other people dying
Him He should die
Yes him
Hes not one of us Hes an outsider a lowborn He does not speak for us
Please
Tell your people what happened here Tell them you live by the grace of Her Majesty When they come forward with notions of retribution or ideas about returning the slave cities to their former glory remind the what happened when Daenerys Stormborn and her dragons came to Meereen
You dont have to be here
Yes I do
My beloved wife Ive missed you terribly
Thank you for returning Lady Bolton safely Now dismount and kneel before me surrender your army and proclaim me the true Lord of Winterfell and Warden of the North I will pardon you for deserting the Nights Watch I will pardon these treasonous lords for betraying my house Come bastard you dont have the men you dont have the horses and you dont have Winterfell Why lead those pour souls into slaughter Theres no need for a battle Get off your hose and kneel Im a man of mercy
Youre right Theres no need for a battle Thousands of men dont need to die Only one of us Lets end this the old way You against me
I keep hearing stories about you bastard The way people in the North talk about you youre the greatest swordsman who ever walked Maybe you are that good Maybe not I dont know if Id beat you But I know that my army will beat yours I have 6000 men You have what half that Not even
Aye you have the numbers Will your men want to fight for you when they hear you wouldnt fight for them
Hes good Very good Tell me will you let your little brother die because youre too proud to surrender
How do we know you have him
Now if you want to save
Youre going to die tomorrow Lord Bolton Sleep well
Shes a fine woman your sister I look forward to having her back in my bed And youre all finelooking men My dogs are desperate to meet you I havent fed them for seven days Theyre ravenous I wonder which parts theyll try first Your eyes Your balls Well find out soon enough In the morning then bastard
If he was smart hed stay inside the walls of Winterfell and wait us out
Thats not his way He knows the North is watching If the other houses sense weakness on his part theyll stop fearing him He cant have that Fear is his power
Its his weakness too His mean dont want to fight for him Theyre forced to fight for him If they feel the tide turning
Its not his men that worry me Its his horses I know what mounted knights can do to us
You and Stannis cut through us like piss through snow
Were digging trenches all along our flanks They wont be able to hit us the way that Stannis hit you in a double envelopment TORMUND stares blankly a
A pincer move
They wont be able to hit us from the sides
Good
Its crucial that we let them charge at us Theyve got the numbers we need the patience If we let him buckle our center hell pursue Then well have him surrounded on three sides
Did you really think that cunt would fight you man to man
No But I wanted to make him angry I want him coming at us full tilt
We should all get some sleep
Rest Jon Snow We need you sharp tomorrow
So youve met the enemy drawn up your battle plans
Aye for what theyre worth
Youve known him for the space of a single conversation you and your trusted advisors and you sit around and make your plans on how to defeat a man you dont know I lived with him I know the way his mind works I know how he likes to hurt people Did it ever once occur to you that I might have some insight
Youre right
You think hes going to fall into your trap He wont Hes the one who lays traps
Hes overconfident
He plays with people Hes far better at it than you Hes been doing it all his life
Aye and what have I been doing all my life Playing with broomsticks I fought beyond the Wall against worse than Ramsay Bolton Ive defended the Wall from worse than Ramsay Bolton
You dont know him
All right tell me What should we do How do we get Rickon back
Well never get him back Rickon is Ned Starks trueborn son which makes him a greater threat to Ramsay than you a bastard or me a girl As long as he lives Ramsays claim to Winterfell will be contested which means he wont live long
We cant give up on our brother
Listen to me please He wants you to make a mistake
Of course he does What should I do differently
I dont know I dont know anything about battles Just dont do what he wants you to do
Aye thats good advice
You think thats obvious
Well it is a bit obvious
If you had asked for my advice earlier I would have told you not to attack Winterfell until we have a larger force or is that obvious too
When will we have a larger force Weve pleaded with every house thatll have us The Blackfish cant help us Were lucky to have this many men
Its not enough
Now its not enough Its what we have Battles have been won against greater odds
If Ramsay wins Im not going back there alive Do you understand me JON SNOW I wont ever let him touch you again Ill protect you I promise
No one can protect me No one can protect anyone
You think theres hope
Ive never seen these Bolton fuckers fight And theyve never seen the free folk fight so yes theres hope You want to avenge your king dont you
It wasnt the Boltons defeated Stannis It was Stannis himself I loved the man He lifted me up and made me something But he had demons in his skull whispering foul things
You saw these demons
What
No its a manner of speaking Not actual demons
Oh Well you loved that cunt Stannis and I loved the man he burned Mance didnt have demons in his skull He didnt torch people or listen to some red witch I believed in him I thought he was the man to lead us through the Long Night But I was wrong just like you
Maybe that was our mistake believing in kings
Jon Snows not a king
No hes not
I need a good drink to help me sleep the night before a fight You want some I have a jug of sour goats milk stronger than any of that grape water you southern twats like sucking on
No thanks It does sound delicious but I better keep a clear head I can never sleep the night before a battle
So what do you do all night
I walk Think and walk Think and walk until Im far enough away from camp that no one can hear me shitting my guts out
Happy shitting
My lady You werent at the war council
Im not a soldier
Any advice
Dont lose
If I do if I fall dont bring me back
Ill have to try
Im ordering you not to bring me back
I am not your servant Jon Snow
Youre in my camp Im the commander
I serve the Lord of Light I do what he commands
How do you know what he commands
I interpret his signs as well as I can If the Lord didnt want me to bring you back how did I bring you back I have no power Only what he gives me and he gave me you
Why
I dont know Maybe youre only needed for this small part of his plan and nothing else Maybe he brought you here to die again
What kind of god would do something like that
The one weve got
Last time we saw each other was at Winterfell yes You were making jokes about my height I seem to recall Everyone who makes a joke about a dwarfs height thinks hes the only person ever to make a joke about a dwarfs height The height of nobility a man of your stature someone to look up to Youre all making the same five or six jokes
It was a long time ago
It was And how have things been going for you since then Not so well I gather Cant imagine you would have murdered the Stark boys if things had been going well
I didnt murder the Stark boys But I did things that were just as bad or worse
And he paid for them
Doesnt seem like it Hes still alive It was complicated for you Im sure growing up at Winterfell Never quite knowing who you were But then we all live complicated lives dont we
Youve brought us 100 ships from the Iron Fleet with men to sail them In return I expect you want me to support your claim to the throne of the Iron Islands
Not my claim Hers
And whats wrong with you
Im not fit to rule
We can agree upon that at least
Has the Iron Islands ever had a queen before
No more than Westeros
Our Uncle Euron returned home after a long absence He murdered our father and took the Salt Throne from yara He would have murdered us if we had stayed
Lord Tyrion tells me your father was a terrible king
You and I have that in common
We do And both murdered by a usurper as well
Will their ships be enough
With the former Masters fleet possibly Barely There are more than 100 ships in the Iron Fleet
There are and Euron is building more Hes going to offer them to you
So why shouldnt I wait for him
The Iron Fleet isnt all hes bringing He also wants to give you 
His big cock I think he said Eurons offer is also an offer of marriage you see You wont get one without the other
And I imagine your offer is free of any marriage demands
I never demand but Im up for anything really
He murdered our father and would have murdered us Hell murder you as soon as you have what he wants
The Seven Kingdoms
All of them
And you dont want the Seven Kingdoms
Your ancestors defeated ours and took the Iron Islands We ask you to give them back
And thats all
Wed like you to help us murder an uncle or two who dont think a womans fit to rule
Reasonable
What if everyone starts demanding their independence
Shes not demanding shes asking The others are free to ask as well Our father were evil men all of us here They left the world worse than they found it Were not going to do that Were going to leave the world better than we found it
You will support my claim as queen of the Seven Kingdoms and respect the integrity of the Seven Kingdoms No more reaving roving raiding or raping
Thats our way of life
No more
No more
Do you like games little man Lets play a game Run to your brother The sooner you make it to him the sooner you get to see him Thats it Thats the game Easy Ready Go

Tormund
Get him back
Fuck this come on
Their armys gone
Our armys gone
We have Winterfell They dont have the men for a siege All we have to do is wait
You suggested one on one combat didnt you
Ive reconsidered I think that sounds like a wonderful idea
Were going to bury my brother in the crypt next to my father
Jon
Where is he
Ah Sansa Hello Sansa Is this where Ill be staying now No Our time together is about to come to an end Thats all right You cant kill me Im part of you now
Your words will disappear Your house will disappear Your name will disappear All memory of you will disappear
My hounds will never harm me
You havent fed them in seven days You said it yourself
Theyre loyal beasts
They were Now theyre starving
Sit Down Down Down Down Down
Your Grace The trial will be getting underway soon
You got my money
Later Go away
Grand Maester
Ser Loras Tyrell Are you prepared to stand trial and profess your guilt or innocence before the Seven
Therell be no need for a trial I confess before the Seven and freely admit to my crimes
To which crimes will you be confessing
All of them I lay with other men including the traitor Renly Baratheon
I perjured myself before the gods I am guilty of depravity dishonesty profligacy and arrogance I see that now I humble myself before the Seven and accept whatever punishment the gods deem just
The gods judgment is fierce but also fair The Warrior punishes those who believe themselves beyond the reach of justice But the Mother shows her mercy to those who kneel before her
I take full responsibility for my many sins and unburden myself of my desires My only remaining wish is to devote my life to the Seven May I be a living example of their grace for others to witness
You understand fully what this means
I do I will abandon the Tyrell name and all that goes with it I will renounce my lordship and my claims on Highgarden I will never marry and I will never father children
Brother Loras
I ask you to dedicate your life to the seven gods
Will you fight to defend your faith against heretics and apostates
I will
No I cant let them
Faith is the way Father
All right Im ready
I have to go Im Im late for the trial
You mutilated him You gave me your word
Ive kept my word Once the queen mothers trial is concluded Brother Loras is free to leave
And where is the queen mother
Her litter never left the Red Keep
It appears the queen mother doesnt wish to attend her own trial
Go to the Red Keep and show her the way
Get the others
Wheres the king
Elsewhere Im afraid
Whats the meaning of this I was told that I have more important things to do with my time than waste them in the presence
Please Grand Maester I bear you no ill will Please forgive me if you can
This pains me my lord Whatever your faults you do not deserve to die alone in such a cold dark place But sometimes before we can usher in the new the old must be put to rest
The longer you wait the worse itll be for you
What are you doing
Theres something wrong
You have nothing to fear Your Grace The trial will begin shortly
Cersei is not here Tommen is not here Why do you think they are not here
If the accused is not here she will be tried regardless We cannot escape the justice of the gods
Forget about the bloody gods and listen to what Im telling you Cersei understands the consequences of her absence and she is absent anyway which means she does not intend to suffer those consequences The trial can wait We all need to leave
We all need to leave now
Loras Stay with me
Let me through Let me through Get out of my way
Let us through
Confess Confess
No
Confess
Confess It felt good Beating me starving me frightening me humiliating me You didnt do it because you cared about my atonement You did it because it felt good I understand I do things because they feel good I drink because it feels good I killed my husband because it felt good to be rid of him I fuck my brother because it feels good to feel him inside me I lie about fucking my brother because it feels good to keep our son safe from hateful hypocrites I killed your High Sparrow and all his little sparrows all his septons all his septas all his filthy soldiers because it felt good to watch them burn It felt good to imagine their shock and their pain No thought has ever given me greater joy Even confessing feels good under the right circumstances
Youve always been quiet
I said my face would be the last thing you saw before you died Do you remember
Good Im glad to see your face Im ready to meet the gods
What Now Today Youre not going to die today Youre not going to die for quite a while Ser Gregor
This is Ser Gregor Clegane Hes quiet too
Your gods have forsaken you This is your god now
No
Shame
Shame
Shame
Im very sorry Your Grace Very sorry
For House Lannister
Hear me roar
For House Frey
We stand together
May we stand together through the centuries good friends to the last
And when we drive our swords through our enemies hearts may we speak the words of our alliance The Freys and the Lannisters send their regards
You dont even have to do anything do you
You just sit there a rich slab of beef and all the birds come pecking
Youre welcome to her
She doesnt want me She wants your golden fingers up her twat
Those two have their eyes on you
They have their eyes on you cunt
Not my type
Not blonde enough
Ladies have you met Ser Bronn of the Blackwater hero of the Battle of Blackwater Bay
There you go
Maybe Im not in the mood
Fuck it
No need to call me ser just because Im an anointed knight
This came together rather well Your father would be pleased
Im sure he would be
Edmure is back in a cell Cant go killing my son by law It wouldnt be right Give the family a bad name
So the famous Blackfish killed by footsoldiers eh Legendary warrior everyone said
Have you done much fighting yourself Lord Frey
Im a bit old for all that
No but back in your day
The purpose of fighting is defeating your enemies isnt it
Ive defeated mine Riverrun belonged to House Tully for a thousand years Now its mine What do you call that Victory
Yes youre a great conqueror
Go on mock me boy You think I mind The Tullys mocked me for years The Starks mocked me Where are they now You talk about war as if youre an expert but the one battle I remember you fighting you were captured by Robb Stark the Young Wolf But it doesnt matter Here we are now two kingslayers We know what its like to have them grovel to our faces and snigger behind our backs We dont mind do we Fear is a marvelous thing
They dont fear the Freys though They fear the Lannisters We gave you the Riverlands to hold the Riverlands If we have to ride north and take them back for you every time you lose them why do we need you
Show me
Your Grace theres no need
Show me
What are your thoughts concerning the kings funeral As the Sept of Baelor is no longer an option perhaps a ceremony in the throne room
He should be with his grandfather his brother his sister Burn him and bury his ashes where the sept once stood
Hello
From Lord Commander Snow at Castle Black
Im Im to be the new maester
Oh
According to our records Jeor Mormont is Lord Commander
He died
We received no report from the maester at Castle Black
Maester Aemon became quite ill shortly after the election Hes since passed away Which is why Im here
This is irregular
Yes well I suppose that life is irregular
The archmaester will discuss these irregularities with you In the meantime you are permitted to use the library Follow me
No women or children
When we had feasts our family would sit up here and Id sit down there
Could have been worse Jon Snow You had a family You had feasts
Aye youre right I was luckier than most
What is that
Tell him Tell him who it belonged to
The Princess Shireen
Tell him what you did to her Tell him
We burned her at the stake
Why
The army was trapped The horses were dying It was the only way
You burned a little girl alive
I only do what my Lord commands
If he commands you to burn children your Lord is evil
We are standing here because of him Jon Snow is alive because the Lord willed it
I loved that girl like she was my own She was good She was kind And you killed her
So did her father So did her mother Her own blood knew it was the only way
The only way for what They all died anyway You told everyone Stannis was the one You had him believing it all of them fooled And you lied
I didnt lie I was wrong
Aye you were wrong How many died because you were wrong
I ask your leave to execute this woman for murder She admits to the crime
Do you have anything to say for yourself
Ive been ready to die for many years If the Lord was done with me so be it but hes not Youve seen the Night King Jon Snow You know the great war is still to come You know the army of the dead will be upon us soon And you know I can help you win that war
Ride south today If you return to the North Ill have you hanged as a murderer
If you ever come back this way I will execute you myself
Im having the lords chamber prepared for you
Mother and Fathers room You should take it
Im not a Stark
You are to me
Youre the Lady of Winterfell You deserve it Were standing here because of you The battle was lost until the Knights of the Vale rode in They came because of you You told me Lord Baelish sold you to the Boltons
And you trust him
Only a fool would trust Littlefinger I should have told you about him about the Knights of the Vale Im sorry
We need to trust each other We cant fight a war amongst ourselves We have so many enemies now
Jon
A raven came from the Citadel A white raven Winter is here
Well Father always promised didnt he
The last time a Tyrell came to Dorne he was assassinated 100 red scorpions was it
You have nothing to fear from us Lady Olenna
You murder your own prince but you expect me to trust you
We invited you to Dorne because we needed your help You came to Dorne because you needed our help
What is your name again Barbaro
Obara
Obara You look like an angry little boy Dont presume to tell me what I need
Forgive my sister What she lacks in diplomacy she makes
Do shut up dear
Anything from you
No Good Let the grown women speak
The Lannisters have declared war on House Tyrell They have declared war on Dorne We must be allies now if we wish to survive
Cersei stole the future from me She killed my son She killed my grandson She killed my granddaughter Survival is not what Im after now
Youre absolutely right I chose the wrong words It is not survival I offer It is your hearts desire
And what is my hearts desire
Vengeance Justice
Fire and blood
Your ships are nearly ready I saw them painting the sails
Im curious to see how the Dothraki do on the poison water
Youre not coming with us
New strategy You want the Second Sons to attack from the west coast If we take Casterly Rock the Lannisters will have nowhere to run when you hit Kings Landing
Youre not going to Westeros Youre staying here with the Second Sons Theres finally peace in Meereen You will keep the peace while the people choose their own leaders
Fuck Meereen Fuck the people Im here for you not them
You promised me My sword is yours My life is yours This is what I command If Im going to rule in Westeros Ill need to make alliances The best way to make alliances is with marriage
Who are you marrying this time
I dont know Maybe no one
But you need to lure all the noble houses to the table Are you a queen or fish bait
I cant bring a lover to Westeros
A king wouldnt think twice about it
So thats what you want To be my mistress
Im not proud I dont care what perfumed aristocrat sits beside you in the throne room I dont want a crown I want you
I love you And I make you happy You know I do Bring me with you Let me fight for you
I cant
The dwarf told you to do this
No one tells me to do anything
Clever fellow Cant argue with his logic Im no use to you over there
Dont get angry
Im not angry Im full of selfpity Who comes after you Who can ever follow Daenerys Stormborn the Mother of Dragons
A great number of women I imagine Specific orders will be left for you regarding the welfare of Meereen and the Bay of Dragons
Bay of Dragons
We cant call it Slavers Bay anymore can we
Youll get that throne you want so badly Im sure of it I hope it brings you happiness
I pity the lord of Westeros They have no idea whats coming for them
Farewell Daario Naharis
How did he take it
No tears
I know it was hard for you You turned away a man who truly loves you because he would have been a liability in the Seven Kingdoms Thats the kind of selfsacrifice that makes for a good ruler if its any consolation
Its not
No I suppose not Im terrible at consoling
Yes you really are
All right how about the fact that this is actually happening You have your armies you have your ships you have your dragons Everything youve ever wanted since you were old enough to want anything Its all yours for the taking Are you afraid
Good Youre in the great game now And the great games terrifying The only people who arent afraid of failure are madmen like your father
Do you know what frightens me I said farewell to a man who loves me A man I thought I cared for And I felt nothing Just impatient to get on with it
He wasnt the first to love you and he wont be the last
Well you have completely failed to console me
For what its worth Ive been a cynic for as long as I can remember Everyones always asking me to believe in things family gods kings myself It was often tempting until I saw where belief got people So I said no thank you to belief And yet here I am
I believe in you Its embarrassing really Id swear you my sword but I dont actually own a sword
Its your counsel I need
Its yours Now and always
Good I um I had something made for you Im not sure if its right
Tyrion Lannister I name you Hand of the Queen
Youre not one of mine are you
No my lord
Didnt think so Too pretty
Where are my damn moron sons Black Walder and Lothar promised to be here by midday
Theyre here my lord
Well what are they doing trimming their cunt hairs Tell them to come here now
But theyre already here my lord
Here my lord
They werent easy to carve Especially Black Walder
What
My name is Arya Stark I want you to know that The last thing youre ever going to see is a Stark smiling down at you as you die
Forgive me my lady if youre at prayer
Im done with all that I came here every day when I was a girl I prayed to be somewhere else Back then I only ever thought about what I wanted never about what I had
I was a stupid girl
You were a child
What do you want
I thought you knew what I wanted
I was wrong
No you werent Every time Im faced with a decision I close my eyes and see the same picture Whenever I consider an action I ask myself will this action help to make this picture a reality Pull it out of my mind and into the world And I only act if the answer is yes A picture of me on the Iron Throne and you by my side
Its a pretty picture
News of this battle will spread quickly through the Seven Kingdoms Ive declared for House Stark for all to hear
Youve declared for other houses before Lord Baelish Its never stopped you from serving yourself
The past is gone for good You can sit here mourning its departure or you can prepare for the future You my love are the future of House Stark Who should the North rally behind A trueborn daughter of Ned and Catelyn Stark born here at Winterfell or a motherless bastard born in the south
This is where I leave you
Youre not coming with us
The Wall is not just ice and stone Ancient spells were carved into its foundations Strong magic to protect men from what lies beyond And while it stands the dead cannot pass I cannot pass
Where will you go
The great war is coming and I still fight for the living Ill do what I can as long as I can
Thank you Uncle Benjen
I wish you both good fortune
Are you sure youre ready for this
Im the ThreeEyed Raven now I have to be ready for this
Ned
Lyanna
Is that you Is that really you
Youre not a dream
No Im not a dream Im here Right here
Ive missed you big brother
Ive missed you too
I want to be brave
Shh You are
Im not
I dont want to die
Youre not going to die
Get her some water
No no water
Is there a maester
Please Listen to me Ned
If Robert finds out hell kill him you know he will You have to protect him Promise me Ned Promise me
Promise me Ned Promise me
You cant expect Knights of the Vale to side with wildling invaders
We didnt invade We were invited
Not by me
The free folk the northerners and the Knights of the Vale fought bravely fought together and we won My father uses to say we find our true friends on the battlefield
The Boltons are defeated The war is over Winter has come If the maesters are right itll be the coldest one in a thousand years We should ride home and wait out the coming storms
The war is not over And I promise you friend the true enemy wont wait out the storm He brings the storm
Your son was butchered at the Red Wedding Lord Manderly But you refused the call You swore allegiance to House Stark Lord Glover but in their hour of greatest need you refused the call And you Lord Cerwyn your father was skinned alive by Ramsay Bolton Still you refuse the call But House Mormont remembers The North remembers We know no king but the King in the North whose name is Stark I dont care if hes a bastard Ned Starks blood runs through his veins Hes my king from this day until his last day
Lady Mormont speaks harshly and truly My son died for Robb Stark the Young Wolf I didnt think wed find another king in my lifetime I didnt commit my men to your cause cause I didnt want more Manderlys dying for nothing But I was wrong Jon Snow avenged the Red Wedding He is the White Wolf ing in the North
I did not fight beside you on the field and I will regret that until my dying day A man can only admit when he was wrong and ask forgiveness
Theres nothing to forgive my lord
There will be more fights to come House Glover will stand behind House Stark as we have for a thousands years And I will stand behind Jon Snow the King in the North
ing in the North
ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North ing in the North
Come on
I now proclaim Cersei of the House Lannister First of Her Name Queen of the Andals and the First Men Protector of the Seven Kingdoms
Long may she reign
Youre wonder why I brought you all here After all we just had a feast Since when does old Walder give us two feasts in a single fortnight
Well its no good being lord of the Riverlands if you cant celebrate with your family Thats what I say
Ive gathered every Frey who means a damn thing so I can tell you my plans for this great house now that winter has come But first a toast No more of that Dornish horse piss This is the finest Arbor gold Proper wine for proper heroes
Stand together
Stand together
Not you Im not wasting good wine on a damn woman
Maybe Im not the most pleasant man Ill admit it But Im proud of you lot Youre my family the men who helped me slaughter the Starks at the Red Wedding
Yes yes Cheer Brave men all of you Butchered a woman pregnant with her babe Cut the throat of a mother of five Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home But you didnt slaughter every one of the Starks
No no that was your mistake You should have ripped them all out root and stem
Leave one wolf alive and the sheep are never safe
When people ask you what happened here tell them the North remembers Tell them winter came for House Frey
You wildlings
Im Meera Reed daughter of Howland Reed This is Brandon Stark son of Ned Stark
How do I know thats true
You were at the Fist of the First Men You were at Hardhome Youve seen the Army of the Dead Youve seen the Night King Hes coming for us For all of us
Okay come on Lets get them inside
I want every northern maester to scour their records for any mention of dragonglass Dragonglass kills white walkers Its more valuable to us now than gold We need to find it we need to mine it we need to make weapons from it Everyone aged 10 to 60 will drill daily with spears pikes bow and arrow
Its about time we taught these boys of summer how to fight
Not just the boys
We cant defend the North if only half the population is fighting
You expect me to put a spear in my granddaughters hand
I dont plan on knitting by the fire while men fight for me I might be small Lord Glover and I might be a girl but I am every bit as much a Northerner as you
Indeed you are my lady No one has questioned
And I dont need your permission to defend the North
Well begin training every man woman boy and girl on Bear Island
While were preparing for attack we need to shore up our defenses The only thing standing between us and the Army of the Dead is the Wall and the Wall hasnt been properly manned in centuries Im not the king of the Free Folk
But if were going to survive this winter together
You want us to man the castles for you
Last time we saw the Night King was at Hardhome The closest castle to Hardhome is EastwatchbytheSea
Then thats where Ill go Looks like were the Nights Watch now
If they breach the wall the first two castles in their path are Last Hearth and Karhold
The Umbers and the Karstarks betrayed the North Their castles should be torn down with not a stone left standing
The castles committed no crimes And we need every fortress we have for the war to come We should give the Last Hearth and Karhold to new families loyal families who supported us against Ramsay
Aye
The Umbers and the Karstarks have fought beside the Starks for centuries Theyve kept faith for generation after generation
And then they broke faith
Im not going to strip these families of their ancestral homes because of the crimes of a few reckless sons
So theres no punishment for treason and no reward for loyalty
The punishment for treason is death Smalljon Umber died on the field of battle Harald Karstark died on the field of battle
They died fighting for Ramsay Give the castles to the families of the men who died fighting for you
When I was Lord Commander of the Nights Watch I executed men who betrayed me I executed men who refused to follow orders My father always said The man who passes the sentence should swing the sword and I have tried to live by those words But I will not punish a son for his fathers sins and I will not take a family home away from a family it has belonged to for centuries That is my decision and my decision is final
Ned Umber
Alys Karstark
For centuries our families fought side by side on the battlefield I ask you to pledge your loyalty once again to House Stark to serve as our bannermen and come to our aid whenever called upon
Stand
Yesterdays wars dont matter anymore The North needs to band together all the living north Will you stand beside me Ned and Alys now and always NED
Now and always
You are my sister but I am king now
Will you start wearing a crown
When you question my decisions in front of the other lords and ladies you undermine me
So I cant question your decisions anymore
Of course you can but
Joffrey never let anyone question his authority You think he was a good king
Do you think Im Joffrey
Youre as far from Joffrey as anyone Ive ever met
Thank you
Youre good at this you know
At what
At ruling
No
You are You are They respect you they really do but you have to
Why are you laughing
What did father used to say Everything before the word but is horse shit
He never said that to me
No No he never cursed in front of his girls
Because he was trying to protect us He never wanted us to see how dirty the world really is but Father couldnt protect me and neither can you Stop trying
All right Ill stop trying to protect you and you stop trying to undermine me
Im not trying to undermine you
You have to be smarter than Father You need to be smarter than Robb I loved them I miss them but they made stupid mistakes and they both lost their heads for it
And how should I be smarter By listening to you
Would that be so terrible
A raven from Kings Landing Your Grace
Cersei of House Lannister First of Her Name Queen of the Andals and the First Men Protector of the Seven Kingdoms
What does she want
Come to Kings Landing Bend the knee or suffer the fate of all traitors
Youve been so consumed with the enemy to the north youve forgotten about the one to the south
Im consumed with the Night King because Ive seen him And believe me youd think of little else if you had too
We still have a wall between us and the Night King Theres nothing between us and Cersei
Theres a thousand miles between us and Cersei Winter is here The Lannisters are a southern army Theyve never ranged this far north
Youre the military man but I know her If youre her enemy shell never stop until shes destroyed you Everyone whos ever crossed her shes found a way to murder
You almost sound as if you admire her
I learned a great deal from her
What is this
Its what weve been waiting for our whole lives Its what Father trained us for whether he knew it or not
He knew it Made me memorize every damn city town lake forest and mountain
Its ours now we just have to take it
Youve been quiet since you came home Are you angry with me
No not angry
Are you afraid of me
Should I be
Daenerys Targaryen has chosen Tyrion to be her Hand Right now theyre sailing across the Narrow Sea hoping to take back her fathers throne Our little brother the one you love so much the one you set free the one who murdered our father and our firstborn son now he stands beside our enemies and gives them counsel Hes out there somewhere at the head of an armada Where will they land
Dragonstone
They have deepwater ports for the ships Stannis left the castle unoccupied and thats where she was born
Enemies to the east
Enemies to the south Ellaria Sand and her brood of bitches
Enemies to the west Olenna the old cunt Another traitor
Enemies to the north Ned Starks bastard has been named King in the North and that murdering whore Sansa stands beside him Enemies everywhere Were surrounded by traitors Youre in command of the Lannister army now How do we proceed
Winter is here We cant win a war if we cant feed our men and our horses The Tyrells have the grain the Tyrells have the livestock
Will the Tyrell bannermen stand alongside a Dothraki horde and Unsullied slave soldiers
If they think Daenerys will win No one wants to fight on the losing side Right now we look like the losing side
Im the Queen of the Seven Kingdoms
Three kingdoms at best Im not sure you understand how much danger were in
I understand were in a war for survival I understand whoever loses dies I understand whoever wins could launch a dynasty that lasts a thousand years
A dynasty for whom Our children are dead Were the last of us
A dynasty for us then
We never talked about Tommen
Theres nothing to say
Our baby boy killed himself
He betrayed me He betrayed us both Should we spend our days mourning the dead mother father and all our children
Cersei
I loved them I did But theyre ashes now and were still flesh and blood Were the last Lannisters the last ones who count
Even Lannisters cant survive without allies Where are our allies now You saw what happened to Walder Frey and his family
I heard How could we ever trust a man like that
We couldnt He was a useless old coward but the Freys supported us Now theyre all dead Whoever killed them is no friend of ours We need allies Stronger better allies We cant win this war alone
You think I listened to Father for 40 years and learned nothing
The Greyjoys You invited the Greyjoys to Kings Landing
Not all of them
Well it looks like all of them
I invited Euron Greyjoy the new King of the Iron Islands You said yourself we needed stronger better allies There you are
How are they better allies How are they different from the Freys They both broke their promises and murdered their former friends as soon as it suited them
So does everyone when it suits them Unlike the Freys they have ships And theyre good at killing
Theyre not good at anything I know the Ironborn Theyre bitter angry little people All they know how to do is steal things they cant build or grow themselves
Euron Greyjoy didnt come here for that
Oh what did he come here for then
A queen
The moment I was chosen Lord of the Iron Islands they turned on me Their own uncle They stole my best ships and ran Sailed the right across the world and gave them to the Dragon Queen so she could bring her armies here to attack you
Its nothing compares to the treason you suffered at the hands of a family members from what I hear But still it bothers me Murdering them would make me feel a lot better And since it appears that all our treasonous family members are fighting for the same side I thought we rightful monarchs could murder them together
Youre not a rightful monarch though are you
The Greyjoys rebelled agains the throne for the right to be monarchs but as I recall you were soundly defeated Come to mention it werent you the one who started that rebellion by sailing to Casterly Rock and burning the Lannister fleet You certainly caught us there Very smart move on your part Of course we all made it to the Iron Islands anyway I was there
I remember very well I saw you I heard so much talk The best in the world No one can stop him I didnt believe it to be honesty But I must say when you rushed through the breach and started cutting people down it was glorious Like a dance
The people I was cutting down were your own kin
The place was getting crowded I enjoyed watching it I truly did
And I enjoyed killing Greyjoys
A good thing for me If you hadnt crushed us I wouldnt have gone into exile If I hadnt done that I wouldnt be the greatest captain on the 14 seas
If not the most humble
Youre not humble Youre the queen of a great nation You dont care about the Iron Islands Theyre nothing but rocks and bird shit and and a lot of very unattractive people The Iron Fleet on the other hand thats something else entirely Its the greatest armada Westeros has ever seen With the Iron Fleet you own the seas You can defeat the invaders of the east and the pretenders of the north and south
What do you want in return
Ever since I was a little boy I wanted to grow up and mary the most beautiful woman in the world So here I am with a thousand ships and two good hands
I decline your proposal
Why
Youre not trustworthy Youve broken promises to allies before and murdered them at the nearest opportunity You murdered your own brother
You should try it Feels wonderful
I dont expect you to trust me outright You need proof of my honest intentions In my experience the surest way to a womans heart is with a gift A priceless gift I wont return to Kings Landing until I have that for you
Ah Maester Weyland A drinkers liver if ever I saw one
Weigh that
The triumph of transitory pleasures Mankinds curse
Archmaester I was wondering
Whats the weight
Um 147
I was wondering if you had considered my proposition
I dont remember your proposition
I asked you if in light of what Ive seen in the North if I could have access to the restricted area of the library
That area is reserved for maesters Are you a maester
No
Not a very strong proposition is it
Archmaester with respect Ive seen them the Army of the Dead The white walkers W was sent here to learn how to defeat them but everyone in the Citadel those who will even talk to me they all doubt the walkers ever existed in the first place
Everyone in the Citadel doubts everything Its their job But the tales of the Long Night cant be pure fabrication Too many similarities from unconnected sources
Sources in the restricted area
The very same And the simplest explanation for your grating obsession with the white walkers is that youre telling the truth and that you saw what you say you saw
So you believe me
I do Youll finish weighing that heart
That makes you the only person south of the Twins who does
Were not lie the people south of the Twins And were not like the people north of the Twins In the Citadel we lead different lives for different reasons We are this worlds memory Samwell Tarly Without us men would be little better than dogs Dont remember any meal but the last cant see forward to any but the next And every time you leave the house and shut the door they howl like youre gone forever When Roberts Rebellion was raging people that the end was near The end of the Targaryen dynasty How will we survive When Aegon Targaryen turned his eye westward and flew his dragons to Blackwater Rush The end is near How will we survive And thousands of year before that during the Long Night we can forgive them for thinking it truly was the end But it wasnt None of it was The Wall has stood through it all And every winter that ever came has ended
Be a good lad Clean this up
Nope
Nope
Youre a lucky man
Ive heard she beat the Hound in single combat Shes a very impressive woman
What do you want Lord Baelish
I want you to be happy I want you to be safe
I am safe Im at home surrounded by friends I have Brienne to protect me from anyone who would harm me
What about happy Why arent you happy What do you want that you do not have
At the moment peace and quiet
No need to seize the last word Lord Baelish Ill assume it was something clever
My lady
My lady
Why is he still here
We need his men Without the Vale Ramsay Bolton would still hold this castle Littlefinger saved us
He wants something
I know exactly what he wants
He rode through the streets of the city  Down from his hill on high  Oer the winds and the steps and the cobble  He rode to a womans sigh  For she was his secret treasure  She was his shame and his bliss  And a chain and a keep are nothing  Compared to a womans kiss  For hands of gold are always cold  But a womans hands are warm  For hands of gold are always cold  But a womans hands are
Thats a pretty song Ive never heard it before
Its a new one
Are you hungry Weve got some rabbit
I dont want to steal your food
Youre not stealing were offering Come on its gonna be a cold night
You heading south
Kings Landing
Poor girl
Not so bad is it
Depends on your taste I guess If you like your streets covered in shit and pigs blood its the town for you
All my life I wanted to see the Red Keep the Sept of Baelor the Dragonpit Then when I finally make it they wouldnt let me within a mile of the Red Keep the Sept of Baelors blown to hell and the Dragonpit is a damn ruin
The people who live there theyd skin you alive if they could make two coppers off your hide
Worst place in the world
What are you doing in the Riverlands
Theres been some trouble with the Freys up at The Twins so were part of the army thats been sent to keep the peace
Here you go Guests first
Oh no I couldnt You dont have enough
My mother always told me to be kind to strangers Strangers will be kind to you
Youre a long way from home Im sure youve had some adventures though
Yeah endless adventures Theyll be singing about us for a thousand years MAN 3 The truth is when we left home we couldnt wait to get away But now weve been gone a while we cant wait to get home
I just think about my dad out there on his boat all alone I ought o be out there with him
My wifes just had our first baby
Boy or girl
Oh who knows You think soldiers get ravens with news from home
I hope its a girl
Why
Girls take care of their papas when their papas grow old Boys just go off to fight in someone elses wars
Are you old enough to drink
Its blackberry wine I made it myself
Its really good
So why is a nice girl on her own heading to Kings Landing
Im going to kill the queen
Bad night to be outdoors
Youve got real powerful magic to figure that out Did the Lord of Light whisper that in your ear Its snowing Thoros Its windy Its gonna be a cold night
Youre a grouchy old bear arent you Clegane You want some rum
Dont like that shit Its too sweet
Why are you always in such a foul mood
Experience
This seems like a good place to spend the night
These people dont want us here
Seems deserted to me No livestock No smoke coming from the chimney
I dont like the look of it
For a big hard man you scare easy
Ill tell you what doesnt scare me bald cocksuckers like you You think youre fooling anyone with that top knot Bald cunt
Come on Maybe theyve got some ale hidden away
They dont
See if theres a larder They always leave something behind
How do you think it ended for them
With death
Girl died in her fathers arms Both of them covered in blood and a knife at their feet Id say they were starving And rather than letting his little girl suffer he ended it for both of them
Doesnt matter now
No doesnt matter now
Ive known you a long time Dondarrion
Aye I think the first time we met was at that tournament
And I always thought you were dull as dirt
Youre not bad I dont hate you Dont like but youre not bad
Thank you Clegane That warms the heart
But theres nothing special about you
Youre right about that
So why does the Lord of Light keep bringing you back Ive met better men than you and theyve been hanged from crossbeams or beheaded or just shat themselves to death in a field somewhere None of them came back So why you
You think I dont ask myself that Every hour of every day Why am I here What am I supposed to do What does the Lord see in me
And
I dont know I dont understand our Lord
Your Lord
I dont know what He wants from me I only know that He wants me alive
If hes so allpowerful why doesnt he just tell you what the fuck he wants
Clegane
Come over here Dont worry The fire wont bite I want to show you something
Its my fucking luck I end up with a band of fire worshippers
Aye Almost seems like divine justice
Theres no divine justice you dumb cunt If there was youd be dead and that girl would be alive
What do you want
Look into the flames
I dont want to look in the damn flames
You saw me bring him back from the dead after you cut him down Dont you want to know what gave me the power
I keep asking and no one wants to tell me
We cant tell you Only the fire can tell you
What do you see
Logs burning
Keep looking What do you see
Ice A wall of ice The Wall
What else
Its where the Wall meets the sea Theres a castle there
Theres a mountain Looks like an arrowhead The dead are marching past
Thousands of them
Do you believe me now Clegane Do you believe were here for a reason
What the hell are you doing Clegane
Burying the dead
You knew these people
Not really
We ask the Father to judge us with mercy We ask the Mother to Fuck it I dont remember the rest Im sorry youre dead You deserved better Both of you
Mom
You should really sleep Sam
The dead dont
Legends of the Long Night
The Targaryens used dragonglass to decorate their weapons without even knowing what the First Men used it for
What is it
Its a map of Dragonstone The Targaryens built their first stronghold there when they invaded Westeros
Thats dragonglass
A mountain of it Beneath the ground Stannis told me but I didnt think This is important Jon needs to know
Has she come yet
Who
The Dragon Queen Daenerys Stormborn
Havent heard anything
Shall we begin
On a night like this you came into the world
I remember that storm All the dogs in Kings Landing howled through the night
I wish I could remember it
I always thought this would be a homecoming It doesnt feel like home
We wont stay on Dragonstone for long
Good
Not so many lions
Cersei controls fewer than half the Seven Kingdoms The lord of Westeros despise her Even before your arrival they plotted against her Now
They cry out for their true queen They drink secret toasts to my health
People used to tell my brother that sort of thing and he was stupid enough to believe them
If Viserys had three dragons and an army at his back hed have invaded Kings Landing already
Conquering Westeros would be easy for you But youre not here to be queen of the ashes
No
We can take the Seven Kingdoms without turning it into a slaughterhouse If the great houses support your claim against Cersei the game is won With the Tyrell army and the Dornish on our side we have powerful allies in the south
I never properly thanked you for that
They joined our side my queen because they believe in you
You served my father didnt you Lord Varys
I did
And then you served the man who overthrew him
I had a choice Your Grace serve Robert Baratheon or face the headmans axe
But you didnt serve him long You turned against him
Robert was an improvement on your father to be sure There have been few rulers in history as cruel as the Mad King Robert was neither mad nor cruel He simply had no interest in being king
So you took it upon yourself to find a better one
Your Grace when I was ready to drink myself into a small coffin Lord Varys told me about a queen in the east who
Before I came to power you favored my brother All your spies your little birds did they tell you Viserys was cruel stupid and weak Would those qualities have made for a good king in your learned opinion
Until your marriage to Khal Drogo Your Grace I knew nothing about you save your existence and that you were said to be beautiful
So you and your friends traded me like a prized horse to the Dothraki
Which you turned to your advantage
Who gave the order to kill me
King Robert
Who hired the assassins
Who sent word to Essos to murder Daenerys Targaryen
Your Grace I did what had to be done to
To keep yourself alive
Lord Varys has proven himself a loyal servant
Proven himself loyal Quite the opposite If he dislikes one monarch he conspires to crown the next one What king of a servant is that
The kind the realm needs Incompetence should not be rewarded with blind loyalty As long as I have my eyes Ill use them I wasnt born into a great house I came from nothing I was sold as a slave and carved up as an offering When I was a child I lived in alleys gutters abandoned houses You wish to know where my true loyalties lie Not with any king or queen but with the people The people who suffer under despots and prosper under just rule The people whose hearts you aim to win If you demand blind allegiance I respect your wishes Grey Worm can behead me or your dragons can devour me But if you let me live I will serve you well I will dedicate myself to seeing you on the Iron Throne because I choose you Because I know the people have no better chance than you
Swear this to me Varys If you ever think Im failing the people you wont conspire behind my back Youll look me in the eye as you have done today and youll tell me how Im failing them
I swear it my queen
And I swear this if you ever betray me Ill burn you alive
I would expect nothing less from the Mother of Dragons
Forgive me my queen A red priestess from Asshai has come to see you
Queen Daeneys I was a slave once bought and sold scourged and branded It is an honor to meet the Breaker of Chains
The Red Priests helped bring peace to Meereen You are very welcome here What is your name
I am called Melisandre
She once served another who wanted the Iron Throne It didnt end well for Stannis Baratheon did it
No it didnt
You chose an auspicious day to arrive at Dragonstone
Weve just decided to pardon those who served the wrong king
The Lord of Light doesnt have many followers in Westeros does he
Not yet But even those who dont worship the Lord can serve his cause
What does your Lord expect from me
The Long Night is coming Only the prince who was promised can bring the dawn
The prince who was promised will bring the dawn Im afraid Im not a prince
Your Grace forgive me but your translation is not quite accurate That noun has no gender in High Valyrian so the proper translation for that prophecy would be the prince or princess who was promised will bring the dawn
Doesnt really roll off the tongue does it
No but I like it better
And you believe this prophecy refers to me
Prophecies are dangerous things I believe you have a role to play as does another ing in the North Jon Snow
Jon Snow Ned Starks bastard
You know him
I traveled with him to the Wall when he joined the Nights Watch
And why do you think the Lord of Light singled out this Jon Snow aside from the visions youve seen in the flames that is
As Lord Commander of the Nights Watch he allowed the Wildlings south of the Wall to protect them from great danger As King in the North he has united those Wildlings with the northern houses so together they may face their common enemy
He sounds like quite a man
Summon Jon Snow Let him stand before you and tell you things that have happened to him the things that he has seen with his own eyes
I cant speak to prophecies or visions in the flames but I like Jon Snow and I trusted him and I am an excellent judge of character
If he does rule the north he would make a valuable ally The Lannisters executed his father and conspired to murder his brother Jon Snow has even more reason to hate Cersei than you do
Very well Send a raven north Tell Jon Snow that his Queen invites him to come to Drangonstone and bend the knee
Do you think its really Tyrion It could be someone trying to lure you into a trap
Read the last bit
All dwarfs are bastards in their fathers eyes What does that mean
Its something he said to me the first night we met You know him better than any of us What do you think
Tyrion is not like the other Lannisters He was always kind to me but its too great a risk The Seven Kingdoms will bleed as long as Cersei sits on the Iron Throne Join us Together we can end her tyranny
Sounds like a charmer Of course the casual mention of a Dothraki horde a legion of Unsullied and three dragons a bit less charming
What
Fire kills Whites you told me What breathes fire
Youre not suggesting Jon meet with her
No too dangerous
But
But if the Army of the Dead makes it passed the Wall do we have enough men to fight them
If the Mad Kings daughter takes the Iron Throne she will destroy the Realm as we know it Some of you are bannermen of House Tyrell But House Tyrell is in open rebellion against the Crown With their help the Mad Kings daughter has ferried an army of savages to our shores Mindless Unsullied soldiers who will destroy your castles and your holdfasts Dothraki heathens who will burn your villages to the ground rape and enslave your women and butcher your children without a second thought This is how Olenna Tyrell rewards centuries of service and loyalty
You all remember the Mad King You remember the horrors he inflicted upon his people His daughter is no different In Essos her brutality is already legendary She crucified hundreds of noblemen in Slavers Bay And when she grew bored of that she fed them to her dragons
It is my solemn duty to protect the people and I will but I need your help My Lords We must stand together all of us if we hope to stop her
She has three fullgrown dragons Your Grace The same as Aegon when he conquered the Seven Kingdoms How do you propose to stop them
We are currently at work on a solution My Lord
Lord Tarley
Ser Jaime I believe you know my son
Ser Jaime
Rickon isnt it
Dickon
Thats it
Thank you for coming The other lords of the Reach look to you for guidance now more than ever They might not have come if you hadnt
If my queen summons me I answer the call And Ive heard what she does to those that defy her
Do you ride for Hornhill today
I have an army to mobilize It wont be long until the fighting starts
And what side will you be fighting for You were the only man to defeat Robert Baratheon in battle Not even Rhaegar Targaryen could 
Its a long ride back to the reach Ser Jaime How may I serve
I want you to be my ranking general in the wars to come I want you to swear allegiance to Cersei and I want you to help her destroy her enemies All of her enemies
Including Olenna Tyrell Im a Tarley That name means something Were not oath breakers Were not schemers We dont stab our rivals in the back or cut their throats at weddings I swore an oath to House Tyrell
You swore an oath to the Crown as well Lord Tarley
Ive known Olenna since I was a child
She was a great woman once Now shes broken She wants revenge so badly she brought the Dothraki to our shores The Dothraki in Westeros for the first time in history I know you dont like my sister but you have to make a choice Do you fight with us or with the foreign savages and eunuchs
When the war is won the queen will need a new warden of the south I can think of no better man than Randyll Tarley
CITADEL
The infection has spread too far You should have cut off your arm the moment you were touched
How long
It will be years before it kills you It could be 10 could be 20
But how long till
Your mind Six months maybe fewer
Pardon Archmaester I met Stannis Baratheons daughter at Castle Black She had Greyscale as a baby and was cured Isnt there some way 
Does this look like a baby to you
No
Have you studied the varying rates of Greyscale progression in infants and fully grown men
No
Maester Chrissen discovered Shireen Baratheons affliction immediately
This is quite advanced and beyond our skills Ser Were you a commoner Id have you shipped to Valyria at once to live out your life with the Stone Men As an anointed Knight Ill allow you one more day How you choose to spend that time is up to you
Come Samwell
Should we send word to your family Ser
Jorah Jorah Mormont
Mormont
Theres no need Ive been dead to them for years
Come Samwell
UNDER THE RED KEEP
Have you ever been down here Your Grace
No I cant say I have I havent seen these since Robert had them removed from the Throne Room
Curious that King Robert did not have them destroyed
They were his trophies He couldnt keep them around They would have made him look small Sometimes he would come down here and look at them I believe he brought his whores on occasion
Balerion the Dread The beast that Aegon rode across the sea Its flames forged the Iron Throne and brought the Seven Kingdoms to heel Powerful but not invincible
Apparently one of Daenarys dragons was wounded by spears in the fighting pits of Meereen If they can be wounded they can be killed
The finest artilleters and blacksmiths in Kings Landing have been laboring day and night Your Grace If youd kindly pull that lever
If you want the Iron Throne take it We have an army a fleet and three dragons We should hit Kings Landing now Hard With everything we have The city will fall within a day
If we turn the dragons loose tens of thousands will die in the firestorms
Its called war You dont have the stomach for it scurry back into hiding
I know how you wage war We dont poison little girls here Myrcella was innocent
She was a Lannister There are no innocent Lannisters My greatest regret is that Oberyn died fighting for you
Thats enough Tyrion is the Hand of the Queen You will treat him with respect
I am not here to be queen of the ashes
Thats very nice to hear Of course I cant remember a queen who was better loved than my grand daughter The common people loved her the nobles loved her And what is left of her now Ashes Commoners nobles theyre all just children really They wont obey you unless they fear you
Im grateful to you Lady Olenna for your council Im grateful to all of you But you have chosen to follow me I will not attack Kings Landing We will not attack Kings Landing
Then how do you mean to take the Iron Throne By asking nicely
We will lay siege to the capital surrounding the city on all sides Cersei will have the Iron Throne but no food for her army or the people
But we wont use Dothraki and Unsullied
Cersei will try to rally the lords of Westeros by appealing to their loyalty their love for their country If we besiege the city with foreigners we prove her point Our army should be Westerosi
And I suppose were providing the Westerosi
You are
Lady Greyjoy will escort you home to Sunspear and her Iron Fleet will ferry the Dornish army back up to Kings Landing
The Dornish will lay siege to the capital alongside the Tyrell army Two great kingdoms united against Cersei
So your master plan is to use our armies Forgive me for asking but why did you bother to bring your own
The unsullied will have another objective For decades House Lannister has been the true power in Westeros And the seat of that power is Casterly Rock Grey Worm and the Unsullied will sail for the Rock and take it
Do I have your support
You have mine
Dorne is with you Your Grace
Thank you all Lady Olenna may I speak with you alone
I realize youre here out of hatred for Cersei and not love for me But I swear to you she will pay for what shes done and we will bring peace back to Westeros
Peace Do you think thats what we had under your father or his father or his Peace never lasts my dear Would you take a bit of advice from an old woman
Hes a clever man your Hand Ive known a great many clever men Ive outlived them all Do you know why I ignored them The lords of Westeros are sheep Are you a sheep No Youre a dragon Be a dragon
Enter
You leave tomorrow Were you going to say goodbye
I will see you when I return
But you dont know when that will be
No one knows
I wish you good fortune
Missandei 
It is hard for me to say goodbye to you
Why
You know why
I dont
You are my weakness
Thats what I am Your weakness
When Unsullied are young their masters learn their fears One boy is scared of dogs One boy hates high places One is frightened of the ocean They make the boy sleep with dogs or climb a cliff They throw him in the water If he learns to swim good If he drowns good Either way strong Unsullied But I had no fears I was never the biggest never the strongest but I was bravest always
I believe it
Until I meet Missandei from the Isle of Naarth Now I have fear
I do too
No
I want to see you Please
It might be useful Fouthen was a dreadful writer but an excellent researcher
Archmaester I wanted to 
And this one
Maester Faol was quite the opposite A brilliant stylist who invented half the stories he tells
I wanted to ask you 
If you need to write histories Tarley you have to do the research If you want people to read your histories you need a bit of style Im not writing the Chronicle of the Wars Following the Death of King Robert the First so it can sit on a shelf unread
What You dont like the title What would you call it then
Possibly something a bit more poetic
Were not poets Tarley
Archmaester if I could just have a moment
This is your moment Use it wisely
I may have found a way to treat Ser Jorah There are two recorded cases of advanced Greyscale being cured I found the procedure in the Study of Rare Diseases by Archmaester Pilos
Im familiar with Archmaester Pylos and the Study of Rare Diseases
Oh you are
Yes Should I tell you how he died From Greyscale
Oh
The procedure is far too dangerous which is why its now forbidden
Hello
What are you doing
Youre Jorah Mormont Youre the only son of Jeor Mormont
My name is Samwell Tarley Im a sworn brother of the Nights Watch training to serve as maester of Castle Black I knew your father I was with him when he died Youre not dying today Ser Jorah
Drink this
What is it
Rum Drink it all please Im afraid this is going to hurt
If you could take off your shirt
If you wouldnt mind bite down hard Im sorry but no one knows Im here If they hear you screaming then were both finished
Have you ever done this before
No No one else will try so Im the best youve got Have a seat Im going to remove the entire layer of infected tissue then apply a medicinal ointment to the 
Shh shhh Again Im sorry Please try not to scream
INN AT THE CROSSROADS
They say her dragons are bigger than Aegons
Horse shit Cersei is just trying to frighten us
If its true if she lays siege to Kings Landing prices will triple
As long as we get back there before they start
One more round Its a long ride

INN AT THE CROSSROADS
Come in
A raven My King from the Citadel
This message was sent to me by Samwell Tarley He was my brother at the Nights Watch A man I trust as much as anyone in this world Hes discovered proof that Dragonstone sits on a mountain of Dragonglass
I received this a few days ago from Dragonstone It was sent to me by Tyrion Lannister
Hes now Hand of the Queen to Daenerys Targaryen She intends to take the Iron Throne from Cersei Lannister She has a powerful army at her back and if this message is to be believed three dragons
Lord Tyrion has invited me to Dragonstone to meet with Daenerys and Im going to accept
We need this Dragonglass My Lords We know that Dragonglass can destroy both White Walkers and their army We need to mine it and turn it into weapons
But more importantly we need allies The Night Kings army grows larger by the day We cant defeat them on our own We dont have the numbers Daenerys has her own army and she has dragon fire I need to try and persuade her to fight with us Ser Davos and I will ride for White Harbor tomorrow then sail for Dragonstone
Have you forgotten what happened to our grandfather The Mad King invited him to Kings Landing and roasted him alive
I know that
She is here to reclaim the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms The north is one of those seven kingdoms This isnt an invitation its a trap
It could be but I dont believe Tyrion would do that You know him Hes a good man
Your Grace with respect I must agree with Lady Sansa I remember the Mad King all too well A Targaryen cannot be trusted nor can a Lannister
W calle you brothe king an the h rod sout an los hi kingdom
Winter is here Your Grace We need the King in the North in the north
You all crowned me your king I never wanted it I never asked for it but I accepted it because the north is my home Its part of me and I will never stop fighting for it no matter the odds But the odds are against us None of you have seen the Army of the Dead None of you We can never hope to defeat them alone We need allies powerful allies I know its a risk But I have to take it
Then send an emissary Dont go yourself
Daenerys is a queen Only a king can convince her to help us It has to be me
Youre abandoning your people Your abandoning your home
Im leaving both in good hands
Whose
Yours You are my sister You are the only Stark in Winterfell Until I return the north is yours
I delivered his bones myself I presented them to Lady Catlyn as a gesture of goodwill from Tyrion Lannister It seems like a lifetime ago Do give Lord Tyrion my best when you see him
I was sorry when he died Your father and I had our differences but he loved Cat very much So did I She wasnt fond of you was she Well it appears she vastly underestimated you Your father and brothers are gone yet here you stand King in the North Last best hope against the coming storm
You dont belong down here
Forgive me We have never talked properly I wanted to remedy that
I have nothing to say to you
Not even thank you If it werent for me youd have been slaughtered at that battlefield You have many enemies My King but I swear to you Im not one of them I love Sansa as I loved her mother
Touch my sister and Ill kill you myself
Nymeria
Nymeria its me Arya Im heading north girl back to Winterfell Im finally going home Come with me
Come with me
Thats not you OF DORNE OF DORNE INT
You cant have them all Its not fair
Im oldest
Momma will want Cersei for herself
Shes not my momma You can have Cersei I want The Mountain
The Mountain killed father Hell crush you with one hand
Father got careless Thats what Momma says
Will you shut up about Momma Momma momma
Maybe Ill kill you both before we take Kings Landing and then I wont have to share OF DORNE INT OF YARAS SHIP
How can you drink this piss When we reach Sunspear Ill treat you to a Dornish red the best in the world Have you ever been to Dorne
A few times Never stayed long
A boy in every port
A boy a girl Depends on the port
Could we get some more
I thought it wasnt for you
Im developing a taste for it
Hes not your servant
Its fine
So youre going to be Queen of the Iron Islands
Once I kill my uncle
And what will you be handsome
Whatever my queen demands
Hell be my advisor my protector
Oh I see Your protector
So if someone gets too close to you 
He might have to intervene
hold that person back
Until theyve made their intentions known
Why are you standing all the way over there then A foreign invasion is under way It seems like you dont need a protector
Stay here
Euron
Your mother is below deck Keep her safe OF DORNE CAPTAINS QUARTERS OF DORNE CAPTAINS QUARTERS OF DORNE
Kill us Get it over with
Give your uncle a kiss
Theon
Ah come on your cockless hound I have her Come and get her
The bastard of Winterfell
The dwarf of Casterly Rock
I believe we last saw each other on top of the wall
You were pissing off the edge if I remember right You picked up some scars along the road
Its been a long road But were both still here
Im Tyrion Lannister
Davos Seaworth and DAVOS shake hands
Ah the Onion Knight We fought on opposite sides at the Battle of Blackwater Bay
Unluckily for me
Missandei is the queens most trusted advisor
Welcome to Dragonstone Our queen knows this is a long journey She appreciates the effort you have made on her behalf If you wouldnt mind handing over your weapons
Of course
Please this way
Where are you from I cant place the accent
I was born on the Island of Naarth
Ah I hear its beautiful down there Palm trees and butterflies I havent been myself
This place has changed
And Sansa I hear shes alive and well
She is
Does she miss me terribly
A sham marriage and unconsummated
I didnt ask 
Well it was It wasnt Anyway shes much smarter than she lets on
Shes starting to let on
Good At some point I want to hear how a Knights Watch recruit became King in the North
As long as you tell me how a Lannister became Hand to Daenerys Targaryen
A long and bloody tale To be honest I was drunk for most of it
My bannermen think Im a fool for coming here
Of course they do If I was your hand I would have advised against it General rule of thumb Stark men dont fare well when they travel south
True But Im not a Stark
Id say you get used to them but you never really do
Come Their mother is waiting for you
I wondered why you werent there to meet our guests You begged us to summon the King in the North Dont you want to see him again
Ive done my part Ive brought ice and fire together
Strange You spoke so highly of Jon Snow but when he arrives you hide on a cliff I didnt take you for a bashful girl
My time whispering in the ears of kings has come to an end
Oh I doubt that Give us common folk one taste of power were like the lion who tasted man Nothing is ever so sweet again
Neither of us is common folk anymore I did not part on good terms with the King in the North or his advisor
Why
Because of mistakes I made Terrible mistakes I would only be a distraction if I stayed
So where will you go
Volantis
Good If you dont mind my saying I dont think you should return to Westeros Im not sure youd be safe here
I will return dear spider One last time
My Lady 
I have to die in this strange country just like you
You stand in the presence of Daenerys Stormborn of House Targaryen rightful heir to the Iron Throne rightful Queen of the Andals and the First Men Protector of the Seven Kingdoms the Mother of Dragons the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea The Unburnt The Breaker of Chains
This is Jon Snow
Hes King in the North
Thank you for traveling so far My Lords I hope the seas werent too rough
The winds were kind Your Grace
Apologies I have a Flea Bottom accent I know But Jon Snow is King in the North Your Grace Hes not a lord
Forgive me 
Your Grace this is Ser Davos Seaworth
Forgive me Ser Davos I never did receive a formal education but I could have sworn the last King in the North was Torren Stark who bent the knee to my ancestor Aegon Targaryen in exchange for his life and the lives of the northmen Torren Stark swore fealty to House Targaryen in perpetuity But do I have my facts wrong
I wasnt there Your Grace
No Of course not But still an oath is an oath In perpetuity means what does perpetuity mean Lord Tyrion
Forever
Forever So I assume My Lord that youre here to bend the knee
I am not
Oh Well that is unfortunate Youve travelled all this way to break faith with House Targaryen
Break faith Your father burned my grandfather alive He burned my uncle alive He would have burned the Seven Kingdoms
My father was an evil man On behalf of House Targaryen I ask your forgiveness for the crimes he committed against your family And I ask you not to judge a daughter by the sins of her father Our two houses were allies for centuries Those were the best centuries the kingdoms ever known Centuries of peace and prosperity with the Targaryens sitting on the Iron Throne and a Stark serving as Warden of the North I am the last Targaryen Jon Snow Honor the pledge your ancestor made to mine Bend the knee and I will name you Warden of the North Together we will save this country from those who would destroy it
Youre right Youre not guilty of your fathers crime And Im not beholden to my ancestors vows
Then why are you here
Because I need your help and you need mine
Did you see three dragons flying overhead when you arrived
I did
And did you see the Dothraki all of whom have sworn to kill for me
Theyre hard to miss
But still I need your help
Not to defeat Cersei You could storm Kings Landing tomorrow and the city would fall Hell we almost took it and we didnt even have dragons
Almost
But you havent stormed Kings Landing Why not The only reason I can see is you dont want to kill thousands of innocent people Its the fastest way to win the war but you wont do it Which means at the very least youre better than Cersei
Still that doesnt explain why I need your help
Because right now you and I and Cersei and everyone else were children playing at a game screaming that the rules arent fair
You told me you liked this man
I do
In the time since hes met me hes refused to call me queen hes refused to bow and now hes calling me a child
I believe hes calling all of us children Figure of speech
Your Grace everone you know will die before winter is over if we dont defeat the enemy to the north
As far as I can see you are the enemy to the north
I am not your enemy The dead are the enemy
The dead
Is that another figure of speech
The Army of the Dead is on the march
The Army of the Dead
You dont know me well My Lord but do you think I am a liar or a madman
No I dont think youre either of those things
The Army of the Dead is real The White Walkers are real night King is real Ive seen them If they get past the wall and were squabbling amongst ourselves 
were finished
I was born at Dragonstone Not that I can remember it
We fled before Roberts assassins could find us Robert was your fathers best friend no I wonder if your father knew his best friend sent assassins to murder a baby girl in her crib Not that it matters now of course I spent my life in foreign lands So many men have tried to kill me I dont remember all of their names I have been sold like a brood mare I have been chained and betrayed raped and defiled Do you know what kept me standing through all those years in exile Faith Not in any gods Not in myths and legends In myself In Daenerys Targaryen The world hadnt seen a dragon in centuries until my children were born The Dothraki hadnt crossed the sea Any sea
They did for me I was born to rule the Seven Kingdoms And I will
Youll be ruling over a graveyard if we dont defeat the Night King
The war against my sister has already begun You cant expect us to halt hostilities and join you in fighting 
whatever you saw beyond the wall
You dont believe him I understand that It sounds like nonsense
But if destiny has brough Daenerys Targaryen back to our shores it has also made Jon Snow King in the North You were the first to bring Dothraki to Westeros He was the first to make allies with Wildlings and northmen He was named Lord Commander of the Nights Watch He was named King in the North Not because of his birthright He has no birthright Hes a damn bastard All those hard sons of bitches chose him as their leader because they believe in him
All those things you dont believe in he faced those things He fought those things for the good of his people He risked his life for his people He took a knife in the heart for his people He gave his own 
If we dont put asside our enmities and band together we will die And then it doesnt matter whose skeleton sits on the Iron Throne
If it doesnt matter you might as well kneel
Swear your allegiance to Queen Daenerys Help her to defeat my sister and together our armies will protect the north
Theres no time for that Theres no time for any of this While we stand here debating 
It takes no time to bend the knee Pledge your sword to her cause
And why would I do that
I mean no offense Your Grace but I dont know you As far as I can tell your claim to the throne rests entirely on your fathers name And my own father fought to overthrow the Mad King The lords of the north placed their trust in me to lead them And I will continue to do so as well as I can
Thats fair Its also fair to point out that Im the rightful queen of the Seven Kingdoms By declaring yourself king of the northern most kingdom you are in open rebellion
You must forgive my manners You will both be tired after your long journey Well have baths drawn for you and supper sent to your rooms
Am I your prisoner
Not yet
Our Iron Born and Dornish allies were attacked on route to Dorne
And
Two or three ships escaped The rest sunk our captured Ellaria and the sand snakes dead or captured The Greyjoys are dead or captured
All of them
Your sisters dead
Euron has her
You saw him take her And you got away
I couldnt save her I tried
You wouldnt be here if you tried
This is the life Look at them Cheering for a Greyjoy
I have to be honest its making me hard Did you see little Theons face right before he jumped overboard
Oh no
What a twat
My queen Please accept this gift on behalf of all of your loyal subjects in the Iron Islands
I give you 
what no other man could give Justice Justice for your murdered daughter
Youve proven yourself the greatest captain on the 14 seas and a true friend to the crown
A bit more than a true friend
And you deserve a proper reward for your heroism
Theres only one reward I want
You shall have what your heart desires 
when the war is won
With Euron Greyjoy commanding our naval forces and Jaime Lannister leading our armies the sons and daugters of Westeros shall defend our country
Theres nothing quite like it is there The love of the people I suppose you wouldnt know
This same mob spat at my sister not long ago and if you turn on us theyll cheer to see your head mounted on a spike
Or yours They just like severed heads really Listen if you have any advice at all Id love to hear it when we have an hour or two to speak as brothers
Advice
Does she like it gentle or rough A finger in the bum
Shhh shhh shhh not now Well talk later
RED KEEP
I want you to know I understand Even though were enemies you and I I understand the fear that drives you I was there that day when Ser Gregor crushed your lovers head I close my eyes I can hear the sound of Oberyns skull breaking
The sound of your scream I never heard a sound like that I thought thats true love Oberyn looked beautiful that day He really did No one moved like him No one had such skill with a spear Even Ser Gregor couldnt stop him If only he hadnt taunted him He could have walked away and left poor Ser Gregor to die But that wasnt your lovers way was it Now hes burried somewhere And here Ser Gregor is stronger than ever That must be difficult for you When my daughter was taken from me my only daughter well you cant imagine how that feels unless youve lost a child I fed her at my own breast even though they told me to give her to the wet nurse I couldnt bear to see her in another womans arms I never got to have a mother But Myrcella did She was mine and you took her from me Why did you do that
It doesnt matter now
Your daughter is a beauty too Brown eyes those lips A perfect Dornish beauty
I imagine she is your favorite
I know I know were not supposed to have favorites But still were only human We love who we love
Im sorry I cant understand you The gag makes it difficult to understand what youre saying It must be frustrating
We all make our choices You chose to murder my daughter You must have felt powerful after you made that choice
Do you feel powerful now I dont sleep very well not at all really I lie in bed and I stare at the canopy and imagine ways of killing my enemies How to destroy Ellaria Sand the woman who murdered my only daughter I thought about having Ser Gregor crush your skull the way he did Oberyns It would be poetic I suppose but fast Too fast
I thought about having him crush your daughters skull
Shes so beautiful The thought of this lovely face cracking open like a duck egg no its just not right
Momma
Qyburn hes the cleverest man I know Clever enough to learn what poison you used to murder Myrcella The long goodbye was that it
The Long Farewell
Thats the one
How long does the poison take
Difficult to say Hours days it depends on the subjects constitution
But death is certain
Oh yes Your Grace quite certain
Your daughter will die here in this cell You will be here watching when she does You will be here the rest of your days If you refuse to eat we will force food down your throat You will live to watch your daughter rot to watch that beautiful face collapse to bone and dust all the while contemplating the choices youve made
Make sure the guards change the torches every few hours I dont want her to miss a thing
RED KEEP
No
Dont
What are you doing No one can see us like this 
I am queen of the Seven Kingdoms Ill do as I please
Forgive me Your Grace The visitor from Braavos has arrived
Good And well need fresh sheets for the bed
At once Your Grace
RED KEEP
No thank you
My condolences Your Grace on the death of your son From all reports he was a fine young man
The Iron Bank didnt send you hear to offer condolences
Condolences and congratulations Youve become the first ruling queen in the Seven Kingdoms Thats quite an accomplishment The Iron Bank appreciates how you cast off the yoke of superstition freeing the crown from elements that sought to subvert the rule of law
The destruction of the Sept of Baelor was a tragic accident
Indeed But sometimes tragedies are necessary to restore order and rational leadership
The Iron Bank wants its gold back
Your father never minced words either But yes your debts are considerable And you are now engaged in a conflict on several fronts We both know how expensive war can be
And we both know gold wins wars Your vaults are empty Your late husbands profligacy saw to that
Your wealthiest ally is the Tyrells who are now your enemies Youre surrounded on all sides by rivals for the throne
And the Iron Bank wants to bet on a winner
We dont make bets We invest in endeavors we deem likely to be successful
Thats a fancy way of saying bet The war has already begun Ive drawn first blood I decapitated the Dornish snake My armada owns the Narrow Sea
Euron Greyjoys armada owns the Narrow Sea
Euron Greyjoy is loyal to me
For now Daenerys Targaryen has three full grown dragons How well do wooden ships fare against fire breathing dragons
Her dragons might not be as invulnerable as some think Now lets talk about the Targaryen girl You want to invest in her Im guessing the Iron Bank invested considerable gold in the slave trade How are you profits now that Daenerys has freed all the slaves
The slave trade has entered a down turn its true
From what I gather she considers herself more of a revolutionary that a monarch In your experience how do bankers usually fare with revoltionaries
The Lannisters owe the Iron Bank quite a lot of money but Lannisters always pay their debts Do former slaves or Dothraki or dragons
Your fathers daughter indeed
Give me a fortnight Stay in Kings Landing as my honored guest and when you return to Braavos I swear to you my debt will be paid in full
I came out here to brood over my failure to predict the Greyjoy attack Youre making it difficult You look a lot better brooding than I do You make me feel like Im failing at brooding over failing
Im a prisoner on this island
I wouldnt say youre a prisoner on this island Youre free to walk the castle the beaches to go wherever you want
Except to my ship They took my ship
I wouldnt say we took your ship
Im not playing word games with you The dead are coming for us all
Why dont you figure out what to do about my missing fleet and murdered allies and Ill figure out what to do about your walking dead men
Its hard for me to fathom It really is If someone told me about the White Walkers and the Night King 
You probably dont believe me
I do actually
You didnt before Grumpkins and snarks you called them Do you remember You said it was all nonsense
It was all nonsense Everybody knew it But then Mormont saw them and you saw them and I trust the eyes of an honest man more than I trust what everybody knows
How do I convince people who dont know me that an enemey they dont believe in is coming to kill them all
Good question
I know its a good question Im looking for an answer
Peoples minds arent made for problems that large White Walkers the Night King Army of the Dead its almost a relief to confront a familiar monster like my sister
I need to help prepare my people for whats coming I cant help them from here Id like to leave
It seems unlikely that you became King in the North by giving up that easily
Everyone told me to learn from my fathers mistakes Dont go south Dont answer a summons from the Mad Kings daughter a foreign invader And here I am A northern fool
Children are not their fathers luckily for all of us And sometimes theres more to foreign invaders than northern fools that meets the eye Daenerys could have sailed for Westeros long ago but she didnt Instead she stayed where she was and saved many people from horrible fates some of whom are on this island with us right now While youre our guest here you might consider asking them what they think of the Mad Kings daughter She protects people from monsters just as you do Thats why she came here And shes not about to head north to fight an enemy shes never seen on a word of a man she doesnt know after a single meeting Thats not a reasonable thing to ask
So do you have anything reasonable to ask
What do you mean
Maybe you are a northern fool Im asking if theres something I can do to help you
Dragonglass
Yes Volcanic glass obsidian He says you have a tremendous amount of it here
Why are we talking about glass We just lost two of our allies
Which is why I was speaking to Jon Snow a potential ally
And what does the King in the North want with Dragonglass
Apparently it can be turned into weapons that kill White Walkers and their foot soldiers or stop them destroy them Im unsure of the nomenclature
And what do you think of this Army of the Dead and White Walkers and Night Kings
Id very much like to believe that Jon Snow is wrong but a wise man once said that you should never believe a thing simply because you want to believe it
Which wise man said this
I dont remember
Are you trying to present your own statements as ancient wisdom
I would never do that to you The reason I believe Jon Snow is because hes here All of his advisors would have told him not to come I would have told him not to come yet hes here anyway You dont have to believe him Let him mine the Dragonglass If hes wrong its worthless You didnt even know it was here Its nothing to you Give him something by giving him nothing Take a step toward a more productive relationship with a possible ally Keep him occupied while we focus on the task at hand Casterly Rock
What was that Ser Davos said about taking a knife in the heart for his people Did you notice that
You must allow them their flights of fancy Its dreary in the north
Amazing thing to see
I named them for my brothers Vicerys and Rhaegon Theyre both gone now
You lost two brothers as well
People thought dragons were gone forever but here they are Perhaps we should all be examining what we think we know
Youve been talking to Tyrion
He is my Hand
He enjoys talking
We all enjoy what were good at
I dont
You know Im not going to let Cersei stay on the Iron Throne
I never expected that you would
And I havent changed my mind about which kingdoms belong to the throne
I havent either
I will allow you to mine the Dragonglass and forge weapons from it Any resources or men you need I will provide for you
Thank you
So you believe me then about the Night King and the Army of the Dead
You better get to work Jon Snow
How much do we have
4000 bushels My Lady
What does that mean
For the current occupants of the castle its enough food for a year perhaps more
Whats the longest winter in the past 100 years
Im not entirely certain Ill check Maester Llewyns records He kept a copy of every raven scroll
Youre telling me we dont have enough food especially not if the armies of the north come back to defend Winterfell
No My Lady most likely not
We must prepare for that eventuality Every direction the threat comes from this is the best place to be We need to start building up our grain stores with regular shipments from every keep in the north If we dont use it by winters end well give it back to them but if the entire north has to flee to Winterfell there wont be enough time to bring wagonloads of grain with them
Very wise My Lady
Maester Wolkan youll see to it
Are they covering those breastplates in leather
No My Lady
Well shouldnt they be once the real cold comes
They should indeed Pardon me My Lady
You there why isnt there leather on these
Command suits you The northerns are all facing north worried about the threat beyond the wall
So they should be
I know Cersei better than anyone here If you turn your back on her 
You dont know Cersei better than anyone here
I only meant to say 
That the woman who murdered my mother father and brother is dangerous Thank you for your wise council
One of two things will happen Either the dead will defeat the living in which case all our troubles come to an end Or life will win out And what then
Dont fight in the north or the south Fight every battle everywhere always in your mind Everyone is your enemy everyone is your friend every possible series of events is happening all at once Live that way and nothing will surprise you Everything that happens will be something that youve seen before
Lady Sansa at the gate
Hello Sansa
I wish Jon was here
Yes I need to speak to him
Your fathers last living true born son Youre Lord of Winterfell
I can never be the Lord of Winterfell I can never be lord of anything Im the threeeyed raven
I dont know what that means
Its difficult to explain
Try please for me
It means I can see everything Everything thats ever happened to everyone Everything thats happening right now Its all pieces fragments I need to learn to see better When the long night comes again I need to be ready
How do you know all of this
The threeeyed raven taught me
I thought you were the threeeyed raven
I told you its difficult to explain
Bran 
Im sorry for all thats happened to you Im sorry it had to happen here at our home It was so beautiful that night Snow falling just like now And you were so beautiful in your white wedding dress
I have to go back inside Bran
Ill stay a bit longer
CITADEL
Hmm
Hmm Does it hurt
A bit Less than before
The infection no longer appears to be active
Unusual Unlikely One could almost be forgiven for thinking the entire upper layer of diseased skin was debrided and the underlying region treated with some sort of ointment
I dont know anything about that I just started feeling better I assumed it was the rest that did it
And the climate
The climate Youre free to go Ser This chamber is needed for the infectious which you are no longer
Tarley Id like to speak with you in my study this evening
How bad is it
I suppose Ill find out this evening
Where will you go
I surrendered to this sickness the moment I first saw it I knew it would kill me or Id kill myself before it could Daenerys Stormborn convinced me otherwise The only place for me is with her
I owe my life to her and you
Your father saved me more than once Its the least I could do
Perhaps our paths will cross again
I hope they do
ARCHMAESTERS STUDY
You treated him
Yes
Who told you to treat him
No one
Who forbade you or anyone to attempt to treat him
I seem to remember you
But you treated him anyway
I did
I forbade it because its dangerous and rarely successful Especially on someone of that age You could have infected yourself and others You could have devastated the entire Citadel But you didnt Its a meticulous difficult procedure Many maesters whose chains are heavy with healing links have attempted it and failed But you succeeded How
I read the books and followed the instructions
That man is alive because of you You should be proud
Thank you Archmaester
Come here
All these manuscripts and scrolls and rotting away I need you to make copies of them
You were expecting a reward Your reward is not being immediately expelled from the Citadel Youd better get started Be mindful of the paper mites They like flesh as well
We need to find Euron Greyjoys fleet and sink it
Your Grace hes already destroyed a good portion of our fleet To send our remaining ships after him 
Im not talking about sending our ships after him
But youll have to go yourself Eurons ships could be anywhere or in more than one place Youd be flying around the open seas alone for who knows how long
I wouldnt be alone Id have Drogon Vicerion and Rhaegal What can anyone do to them
They can still do something to you It only takes one arrow
Its too great a risk Youre too important
What about Casterly Rock
The Unsullied will be there soon
And what will they face
A difficult situation They know were coming
Yes Cersei believes my sole purpose in life is to destroy House Lannister She will be ready
No one has ever taken the rock
The Lannister army is still the army my father built Well trained and well provisioned 10000 men at least They will see us coming
They will be ready
Draw Loose
The gates of Casterly Rock are impregnable
The fight up the walls will be hard Well be at a disadvantage Many men will die
Interesting thing about my father He built our house up from near ruin He built our army He built Casterly Rock as we know it but he didnt build the sewers That was beneath him So he gave the job to the lowest person he could find Me He was right I was low The company I kept low women mostly They werent welcome at the Rock Father disapproved of that sort of behavior I couldnt walk them through the front gates I couldnt have them in my chambers So in the process of building the sewers I threw in something for myself
It was a passage that began by the sea and ended beneath one of the main guard towers
No better place for low pursuits Casterly Rock the impregnable fortress
As a good friend of mine once said give me 10 good men and Ill impregnate the bitch
And so it begins They will face the bulk of the Lannister forces They will be outnumbered They will have less armor and fewer weapons
But as my sisters armies fights for her the Unsullied will be fighting for something greater They will be fighting for freedom and the person who gave it to them They will be fighting for you And that is why they will triump
There are none left
There are supposed to be more than this Many more
Where are they Where are the rest of the Lannisters
HIGHGARDEN
HIGHGARDEN
S QUARTERS
Its done
It is
And now the rains weep for our whores Did we fight well
I suppose as well as can be expected
It was never our forte Golden roses indeed Your brother and his new queen thought you would be defending Casterly Rock
The truth is Casterly Rock isnt worth much anymore Well it is to me My fond childhood memories wont keep Cersei on the throne
So youll just let them take it
For now They wont be able to hold it Euron Greyjoys navy burned their ships we emptied the larders before we left Eventually theyll be forced to abandon their position and march all the way across Westeros
And you took your army your real army and went where they werent
As Robb Stark did to me at Whispering Wood There are always lessons in failures
Yes You must be very wise by now
My father always said I was a slow learner
If he was so clever why didnt he take Highgarden the moment your gold mines ran dry I suppose Ill be able to ask him myself soon enough No more learning from my mistakes eh How will you do it With that sword
That was Joffreys sword wasnt it Not that he ever used it What did he call it
Widows Wail
He really was a cunt wasnt he I did unspeakable things to protect my family or watched them being done on my orders I never lost a nights sleep over them They were necessary And whatever I imagined necessary for the safety of House Tyrell I did But your sister has done things I wasnt capable of imagining That was my prize mistake a failure of imagination Shes a monster you do know that
To you sure To others as well But after weve won and theres no one left to oppose us the people living peaceful in the world she built do you really think theyll wring their hands over the way she built it
You love her You really do love her You poor fool Shell be the end of you
Possibly Not much to be gained from discussing it with you though is there
What better person to discuss it with What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room But perhaps youre right If shes driven you this far its gone beyond your control
Yes it has
Shes a disease I regret my role in spreading it You will too
I think were done here
How will it happen
Cersei had several ideas Whipping you through the streets and beheading you in front of the Red Keep Flaying you alive and hanging you from the walls of Kings Landing I talked her out of those
Will there be pain
No I made sure of that
Thats good
Halt that wagon JAIME opens the carriage It is filled with gold bars and coins He picks up a large sack and hands it t
You just won the biggest prize in the world What could you possibly have to be upset about Come on You can tell me Queen of Thorns give you one last prick in the balls before saying goodbye
Ill save my confessions for the High Septon
There is no more High Septon
No there isnt is there
There is still the question of my prize is putting a padlock on the wagon bearing the gold He stops and turns to BRONN
Thats a lot of money I just gave you
Its not a castle turns and points to Highgarden
How about that one Its available
You dont want Highgarden
I beg to differ
Were at war Daenerys Targaryen could come take it back the day after you move in Besides think of the upkeep The more you own the more it weighs you down
Oh is that why youre so fucking glum eh All your new riches weighing you down pounds on the back of the carriage and the horses start trotting
Theyre not mine The gold belongs to the Iron Bank We pay our debts
Right Just not to me
Bronn of the Blackwater formerly of whatever nameless shit heap youre from with a saddlebag full of gold complaining about not getting paid When we win this war all the castles in the Seven Kingdoms will be yours to choose from with no one left to take them away from you
Yes Im sure Queen Cerseis reign will be quiet and peaceful
Stranger things have happened
Like what TARLEY and his son DICKON come riding up on horseback addresses JAIME
The granaries are being emptied and loaded into wagons My Lord
The current harvest
We have teams of men collecting it and more farmers in the Reach looks over to BRONN
Ser Bronn will you accompany the Tarleys and help them accelerate this process
Im not much for shoveling weight
No but motivating reluctant farmers to hand over their harvest Ive heard you guys have a real talent for that
My Lord
My Lord RANDYLL DICKON and BRONN break away from the Lannister army and ride into the distance Horse drawn carts are carrying spoils from Highgarden and Lannister men are marching down the road
REDKEEP COUNCIL ROOM CERSEI an NESTORIS from the Iron Bank of Braavos are sitting having a discussion
I must say I dont think the Iron Bank has ever had a debt of this magnitude repaid in a single installment I always considered your father a very effective and efficient man but you appear to be redefining those terms entirely
Youre too kind My Lord
I am neither kind nor a lord Your Grace I am merely an instrument of the institution I represent its wellbeing is a matter of arithmetic not sentiment And the current arithmetic is outstanding The gold 
Is on its way My brother is supervising its transportation himself
Some at the Iron Bank will be disappointed Theyve grown rather fond of your interest payments
We must devise a way to raise their spirits
Yes Perhaps we could be of assistance in some current venture
My only venture at the moment is reestablishing control over this continent and every person on it
I see a great deal of potential in that venture I imagine that it would require outside investment
It will indeed I need to expand my armies my navies My hand Qyburn had made overtures to the Golden Company in Essos
I know them well Theyve helped us recover significant sums from parties who had fallen into deep arrears
Thats good to hear I too would like them to recover some things that belong to me
Rest assured Your Grace you can count on the Iron Banks support as soon as the gold arrives BRANS QUARTERS BRAN is sitting in a wheelchair PETE is sitting next to him unsheathes a Valyrian steel dagger and shows it to BRAN Its the same dagger used in the attempt to assassinate BRAN years ago
This is for you flips the knife in his hand and extends it towards BRAN
The last man who wielded it meant to cut your throat but your mother fought him off BRAN reaches out and takes the knife turning it and looking it over carefully
The other dagger the one that took her life I would have stopped that dagger with my own heart if I could have I wasnt there for her when she needed me most But I am here for her now To do what she would have done to protect her children Anything I can do for you Brandon you need only ask
Do you know who this belonged to
No That very question was what started the War of the Five Kings In a way that dagger made you what you are today Forced from your home driven out to the wilds beyond the Wall I imagine youve seen things most men wouldnt believe hands the sheath of the knife to BRAN BRAN slides the knife into the sheath
To go through all of that and make your way home again only to find such chaos in the world I can only imagine 
Chaos is a ladder BRAN is staring a stops speaking The door opens and Meera appears
Im sorry to have disturbed you Lord Stark BAELISH stands up to leave
Im not Lord Stark BAELISH bows and walks past Meera and closes the door notices BRAN sitting in a wheelchair
Whats that
Maester Wolkan built it for me so I can move around more easily
Its a very good idea
Youre leaving
I dont want to leave you but when they come I need to be with my family And youre safe safe as anyone can be now You dont need me anymore
No I dont
Thats all youve got to say
Thank you
Thank you
For helping me
My brother died for you Hodor and Summer died for you I almost died for you Bran
Im not really not anymore I remember what it felt like to be Brandon Stark but I remember so much else now begins to cry
You died in that cave MEERA turns to walk out the door She hesitates looking at BRAN then walks out
There is a snow blown field ARYA is riding on a horse Winterfell can be seen far in the distance
GATE ARYA approaches the main gate on foot Two guards are huddled by a brazier getting warm Theres indistinct chatter One of the men notice ARYA walking to the gate and approach her
Hey oh Where are you going
In there I live here
Fuck off
Im Arya Stark This is my home Both men look at each and start laughing
Arya Stark is dead
Send for Maester Llewyn or Ser Rodrick Theyll tell you who I am
Theres no Rodrick here
Maesters name is Wolkan
Go ask Jon Snow then the King in the North Hes my brother
Hes a thousand miles away
Its cold Were busy So you know best fuck off
Mmhmm
If Jon Snow is gone who is in charge of Winterfell
The Lady of Winterfell Lady Stark
Which Lady Stark
You tell us Youre the one impersonating her sister
Tell Sansa her sister is home
Lady Sansa is too busy to waster her breath on you just like us So for the last time fuck off MAN 1 goes to grab Arya but she easily dodges out of his grasp
Im getting into this castle one way or another If Im not who I say I am I wont last long But if I am and Sansa finds out that you turned me away ARYA keeps glancing at the men They look uneasy They bring her inside of the gate They indicate towards a cart near the entrance
You sit there Right there Dont move Both guards have a conversation out of earshot of Arya
Go tell Lady Stark Ill watch her ARYA is glancing around Winterfell Men are working building tools and cutting wood ARYA looks over and sees a Winterfell flag sigil hanging from the wall The two guards are still arguing
You tell her
Im not
Because if you dont Ill hit you right in the fucking face as hard as I can The guards turn around and ARYA is gone
INT WINTERFELL SANSAS QUARTERS Sansa is sitting at a table reviewing documents The two guards are in Sansas room explaining what happened
We told her to wait We were standing right next to her
When we turned around she had gone My Lady She was nothing Some winter town girl
She comes in asking for Ser Rodrick and Maester Llewyn
Dont trouble yourself over it My Lady Well find her
You dont have to I know where she is CUT TO WINTERFELL CRYPT is standing look at a statue of Ned Stark holding his sword hears a sound and turns to see SANSA approaching SANSA stops when she see
Do I have to call you Lady Stark now hesitates for a moment
Yes begins smiling then walking towards ARYA reaches out and hugs ARYA
You shouldnt have run from the guards
I didnt run You need better guards SANSA smirks a
It suits you Lady Stark Jon left you in charge
I hope he comes back soon I remember how happy he was to see me When he sees you his heart will probably stop Both girls turn and look at the statue of Ned Stark
That doesnt look like him It should have been carved by someone who knew his face
Everyone who knew his face is dead
Were not turns to face SANSA
They say you killed Joffrey Did you
I wish I had
Me too I was angry when I heard someone else had done it However long my list got he was always first
Your list
Of people Im going to kill begins to laugh ARYA joins her
How did you get back to Winterfell
Its a long story I imagine yours is too
Yes Its not a very pleasant one
Mine neither but our stories arent over yet
No theyre not The girls both embrace again
Arya Brans home too ARYA smiles and looks at SANSA SANSA doesnt smile back The smile fades from ARYAs face is sitting next to the Weirwood tree SANSA and ARYA approach turns to look at them begins speaking to ARYA
You came home ARYA steps forward and throws her arms aroun SANSA smiles in the background ARYA lets go and steps back
I saw you at the crossroads
You saw me
I see quite a lot now
Bran has visions
I thought you might go to Kings Landing
So did I
Why would you go back there
Cersei is on her list of names ARYA stares at BRAN ARYA turns to look a
Who else is on your list
Most of them are dead already BRAN produces the Valyrian dagger that BAELISH gave him and unsheathes it
Where did you get this
Littlefinger gave it to me
Littlefinger hes here ARYA turns to look a
Hes declared for House Stark steps up closer to BRAN and speaks to him
Why would he give you a dagger
He thought Id want it
Why
Because it was meant to kill me
The cutthroat after your fall
Why would a cutthroat have a Valyrian steel dagger
Someone very wealthy wanted me dead
Hes not a generous man He wouldnt give you anything unless he thought he was getting something back
It doesnt matter
What do you mean it doesnt matter
I dont want it BRAN holds the knife out t looks at BRAN
Are you sure Its Valyrian steel
Its wasted on a cripple ARYA looks down at the dagger She steps forward and takes it from BRAN GATE ARYA is pushing BRAN in his wheelchair and SANSA is next to them The Stark children are walking back through the gate of Winterfell Men are milling around doing various jobs BRIENNE an see the Stark children all back at Winterfell together
Catelyn Stark would be proud You kept your vow
I did next to nothing
Youre too hard on yourself My Lady
Im not a pauses for a moment
Thank you Podrick DAENERYS an are walking along a path outside of Dragonstone followed by members of the Queensguard
Your Grace theres still no word from the Unsullied
Soon They will come back to me
He better stops and turns to look at MISSANDEI She then continues walking
What happened begins smirking
Many things
Many things Jon Snow appears at the bottom of the path
Your Grace looks at MISSANDEI then her Queensguard She speaks in Valyrian and motions to her guard to stand down
Its all right DAENERYS descends the stairs with MISSANDEI and they begin walking wit They walk along the beach until they reach a cave DAVOS is waiting for them with a lit torch
I wanted you to see it before we start hacking it to bits leads DAENERYS and MISSANDEI into the cave He lights a brazier and illuminates the Dragonglass along the walls He continues walking deeper into the cave
So this is it all well ever need DAENERYS is looking up at the walls of Dragonglass
There is something else I want to show your Your Grace and DAENERYS go to a further chamber in the cave There are murals painted on the walls of Dragonglass
The Children of the Forest made these
When
A very long time ago
They were right here standing where were standing before there were Targaryens or Starks or Lannisters Maybe even before there were men
No DAENERYS stops looking at the walls and turns to look a walks to another wall and begins to examine the murals The murals depict Children of the Forest and the First Men standing together
They were here together the Children and the First Men
Doing what Fighting each other JON take by the arm and swings her torch to another part of the wall There is a mural of the Night King and White Walkers
They fought together against their common enemy Despite their differences despite their suspicions together We need to do the same if were going to survive and DAENERYS look back at the wall with the Night King
Because the enemy is real Its always been real
And you say you cant defeat them without my armies and my dragons
No I dont think I can steps forward closer to JON
I will fight for you I will fight for the north when you bend the knee
My people wont accept a southern ruler not after everything theyve suffered steps even closer to JON until theyre face to face
They will if their king does They chose you to lead them They chose you to protect them Isnt their survival more important than your pride JON an  DAVOS and MISSANDEI are walking out of the cave As they exit TYRION and VARYS are standing on the beach awaiting them begins addressing Tyrion
What is it
We took Casterly Rock
Thats very good to hear TYRION and VARYS look at each other They arent eager to deliver the bad news
Isnt it The group are all walking along the beach Daenerys is displeased
Youll want to discuss this amongst yourselves Perhaps 
You will stay All my allies are gone Theyve been taken from me while Ive been sitting here on this island
We still have the largest army
Who wont be able to eat because Cersei has taken all the food from the Reach
Call Grey Worm and the Unsullied back We still have enough ships to carry the Dothraki to the mainland Commit to the blockade of Kings Landing We have a plan Its still the right plan stops walking turns and speaks harshly to Tyrion
The right plan Your strategy has lost us Dorne the Iron Islands and the Reach
If Ive underestimated our enemies 
Our enemies Your family you mean Perhaps you dont want to hurt them after all begins looking out to the ocean Three dragons are flying in the sky over the water
Enough with the clever plans turns back and looks at TYRION
I have three large dragons Im going to fly them to the Red Keep
Weve discussed this
My enemies are in the Red Keep What kind of a queen am I if Im not willing to risk my life to fight them
A smart one looks over to JON SNOW
What do you think I should do
I would never presume to 
Im at war Im losing begins walking close to JON
What do you think I should do looks over the ocean at the dragons flying
I never thought that dragons would exist again No one did The people who follow you know that you made something impossible happen Maybe that helps them believe that you can make other impossible things happen Build a world thats different from the shit one theyve always known glances back towards the dragons
But if you use them to melt castles and burn cities youre not different Youre just more of the same DAENERYS looks back out to her dragons flying along the water and PODRICK are sparring kicks PODS foot out from under him and he lands face first in the dirt
Dont lunge PODRICK pushes himself back up and picks up his sword PODRICK attacks again Brienne blocks his blows and kicks his foot out again
Dont go where your enemy leads you ARYA is watching the sparring session from across the courtyard She begins to approach Brienne
Up begins striking at PODRICK while he blocks her blows hits PODRICK in the stomach with the hilt of her sword and PODRICK lands on the ground
And dont 
Dont fight someone like her in the first place PODRICK stands up and retrieves his sword ARYA walks closer to speak t
Nice sword Very nice dagger ARYA looks down at the Valyrian dagger and unsheathes it She approaches BRIENNE flipping the knife several times in her fingers BRIENNE takes the dagger and examines it and BAELISH are walking along the upper section of the courtyard having a conversation
If they havent contributed the right amount of grain to the stores then Im afraid theyll have to make due with SANSA see in the courtyard speaking with BRIENNE and stops to watch her
Its been awhile since Ive trained
I can go and find the Master of Arms for you My Lady
He didnt beat the hound You did I want to train with you BRIENNE chuckles
You swore to serve both of my mothers daughters didnt you nods her head in agreement
Move aside Podrick ARYA draws her sword Needle
You cant use that My Lady Its too small
I wont cut you Dont worry smirks and raises her sword to a fighting posture
Ill try not to strikes at ARYA who quickly sidesteps and parries the attack attacks again and ARYA sidesteps dodges multiple strikes and parrie while smiling ARYA strikes a and hits her hand causin to flinch and lose her twohanded grip on her sword regains composure and starts to circle ARYA BAELISH and SANSA are still watching from the upper balcony ARYA is waiting for an attack with her sword behind her back strikes and ARYA blocks her attacks spins and stabs behind her back and hit in the knee causin s sword to strike the dirt kicks ARYA in the stomach and sends ARYA to the ground ARYA quickly gets back to her feet overpowers ARYA and ARYA drops her sword on the ground strikes again but ARYA dodges draws her Valyrian dagger and puts it nea s neck and ARYA both stop fighting and sheathe their weapons smiling
Who taught you to do that
No one ARYA collects her sword BAELISH remains on the balcony staring at ARYA who looks up at him BAELISH bows to ARYA and walks away JON an are walking along the paths outside of Dragonstone having a discussion
What do you think of her
Who
I believe you know of whom I speak
I think she has a good heart
A good heart Ive noticed you starring at that good heart
Theres no time for that I saw the Night King Davos I looked into his eyes How many men do we have in the north to fight him 10000 Less
Fewer
What and JON near the end of the path MISSANDEI is standing along the path looking at the ocean
Speaking of good hearts Missandei of Naarth turns to looks at DAVOS and JON
Ser Davos Lord Snow
King Snow isnt it No That doesnt sound right King Jon
It doesnt matter
Forgive me but may I ask a question
Of course
Your name is Jon Snow but your fathers name was Ned Stark
Im a bastard My mother and father werent married
Is the custom different in Naarth
We dont have marriage in Naarth so the concept of a bastard doesnt exist
The sounds liberating
Why did you leave your homeland
I was stolen away by slavers
Im sorry
If I may how did a slave girl come to advise Daenerys Targaryen
She bought me from my master and set me free
That was good of her Of course youre serving her now arent you
I serve my queen because I want to serve my queen Because I believe in her
And if you wanted to sail home to Naarth tomorrow 
Then she would give me a ship and wish me good fortune
You believe that
I know it All of us who came with her from Essos we believe in her Shes not our queen because shes the daughter of some king we never knew Shes the queen we chose
Youll forgive me if I switch sides notices a single ship sailing into the bay It has a kraken sigil MISSANDEI turns to look
Is that a Greyjoy ship GREYJOY and other Iron Born are pulling their landing boat onto the beach wading through the surf They pull the boat onto the sand JON SNOW MISSANDEI DAVOS and Dothraki guards are waiting to meet them JON see and both men freeze and stare at each other JON steps forward toward
Jon I didnt know you were here steps closer to JON
Sansa is she all right grabs THEON by his shirt and pulls him face to face
What you did for her is the only reason Im not killing you JON releases THEON
We heard your uncle attacked your fleet We thought you were dead
I should be
Your sister
Euron has her I came to ask the queen to help get her back
The queen is gone
Where did she go FIELDS The Lannister army is returning from sacking Highgarden They are delivering gold and food to Kings Landing There are carts and men that havent made it into the city gates yet JAIME and BRONN are supervising the procession TARLEY comes riding up on his horse
All of the gold is safely through the gates of Kings Landing
Good
We need to get the last of these wagons over the Blackwater Rush before nightfall If the head of the line is ambushed the tail will never be able to reinforce in time
We are stretched a bit thin
With your permission flogging stragglers has a marked effect on mobility
Lets give them fair warning first These men fought well at Highgarden RANDYLL is clearly disappointed He turns and rides off back to the line of soldiers JAIME and BRONN exchange glances then follow RANDYLL BRONN and JAIME are riding through the ranks TARLEY sees JAIME and starts a conversation
Ser Jaime
Rickon
Dickon BRONN openly laughs in DICKONs face and looks a
I hear you fought bravely at Highgarden Your first battle DICKON nods his head in agreement
And
It was glorious
Come on Your fathers not here
All my life weve been pledged to House Tyrell I knew some of those men I hunted with them
They didnt deserve to die But Lady Olenna chose to betray the queen and support the Targaryen girl So here we are
I didnt expect it to smell like that
Men shit themselves when they die Didnt they teach you that at fancy lad school JAIME looks over at
Well I learned it when I was 5 BRONN pauses and strains to hear a noise far in the distance
What
Listen Horses and high pitched war cries are heard beyond the hill in the distance takes off at a gallop yelling orders to the soldiers on the road
Spears and shields Spears and shields The men jump into action and start arming themselves
Spears and shields
In line now is riding across the battlefield yelling orders to men
Come on lads Not those wagons Fall in line Fall in line The Lannister army gets in formation to repel the invading horde Lannister archers line up behind the pikemen The horde is drawing closer The Dothraki come riding over the hill with curved swords held overhead and screaming There are a thousand of them or more DICKON draws his sword is yelling orders to the men
Spears armed The Lannister pikemen drop their spears into a fighting position and ready their shields rides up to JAIME
Get back to Kings Landing
Im not abandoning my army
Youre a commander not a damned infantryman These fuckers are about to swamp us
We can hold them offA dragon can be heard roaring in the distance and DROGON come flying over the Dothraki and over the battlefield commands DROGON to attack
Dracarys DROGON breathes fire into the first line of Lannister soldiers The men burst into flames and start screaming DICKON looks on in shock A flanking group of Dothraki Screamers ride over the flames through the hole created by Drogon and start cutting men down attempts to issue orders to the men
Hold the line The main force of Dothraki crashes into shielded pikemen Men on both sides are being slaughtered A second wave of Dothraki Screamers ride in They switch from a seated position to standing atop their saddles shooting bow and arrow The Lannister archers fire back and many men are killed DAENERYS and DROGON circle around and billow flames across the battlefield DAENERYS steers DROGON down the Kings Road DROGON spews flames and destroys the carriages along the road Carts are exploding into pieces barrels are flying through the air is looking at the carnage in astonishment
Archers Archers with me A group of archers break from the main battle and follo and BRONN lines the men up to counter DAENERYS and DROGON
Knock
Knock Draw DROGON loops around and is making a pass o and the archers DAENERYS and DROGON are diving at the group of men
Loose The archers fire their arrows in unison DAENERYS sees the and turns Drogon so the arrows bounce harmlessly off his breast She makes a run on another line of carriages and DROGON burns them in a single breath Men are screaming and catching on fire and BRONN survey the damage
Qyburns scorpion is over there
Go get it then
I cant shoot with one hand holds up his gold hand to illustrate his point BRONN hesitates for a moment He turns his horse and rides to man the artillery crossbow draws his sword and rides into battle
Come on A Dothraki screamer wielding two swords charges JAIME JAIME is blocking the attacks but is getting overpowered DICKON stabs the screamer through his back JAIME nods at DICKON is making his way to the crossbow A Dothraki screamer sees him and charges reaches behind him and retrieves a small sword He throws the sword at the Dothraki but the screamer parries it draws his primary sword and the two men charge at each other A is about to strike the screamer leans over and cut s horses leg off causin to fall to the ground s bag of gold hits the ground and splits open The screamer is turning his horse around and is about to attac again abandons the gold and runs into the mayhem trying to lose the mounted rider pushes a flaming Lannister soldier out of the way He pulls a sword out of a dead man and uses it to start fighting Dothraki DROGON flies overhead and spews flames through the air manages to escape the mounted rider and disappear into the fog The screamer dismounts and continues the search on foot The screamer climbs onto a covered wagon to check fo When he pulls the canvas back he see behind the crossbow with a bolt pointed at him fires the bolt and impales the Dothraki screamer pulls a lever and the sides of the wagon drop down revealing the crossbow reloads the weapon and begins making adjustments to line up a shot on DROGON
Where are you TYRION walks to the edge of the battlefield accompanied by Dothraki guards He can see Lannisters being slaughtered One of the Dothraki guards begin to speak
Your people cant fight TYRION is watching the mayhem Men are screaming and engulfed in flames Horses and carriages run wild with no driver is still on the battlefield struggling against the horde Burning Lannister men are taking off their helmets revealing melted faces Men crawl to the river in search of relief from the dragonfire DROGON and DAENERYS are flying over the river creating wake in the water sees her approaching his position
Take cover DROGON spits flames into the Lannister position The men standing there are reduced to standing ash The wind blows them away is lining up DROGON in the sights of the crossbow He reaches down and pulls the lever to fire A bolt sails past DROGON and misses reloads the machine DROGON and DAENERYS circle around and dive on the crossbow takes his time aiming his shot
Come on you fucker commands DROGON to fire at the crossbow
Dracarys Before DROGON can send flames BRONN fires a bolt that strikes DROGON in the wing DROGON begins to pinwheel out of control towards the ground BRONN is smiling He whips the machine around and begins reloading DAENERYS and DROGON are falling from the sky DROGON regains control and begins hovering over the river BRONN realizes he doesnt have time to reload and dives out of the way of the incoming dragonfire DROGON spits flames at the machine and instantly destroys it Flames lick over BRONN but he is uninjured DROGON is forced to land on the edge of the river due to his wound DAENERYS climbs from her mount and rushes to pull the spear from DROGONs wing JAIME is 100 yards from DAENERYS watching her She is all alone JAIME sees a spear sticking out of a dead man spots JAIME across the battlefield
Flee you idiot looks at DAENERYS and readies himself He spurs his horse onward
Come on boy Come on JAIME grabs the spear as he rides by and brings it up to position JAIMEs horse is galloping full speed on the edge of the river kicking up water is watching JAIMEs attempt to kill DAENERYS
You could have killed me
What the fuck were you doing back there
Ending the war by killing her
You saw the dragon between you and her looks incredulously at JAIME
And JAIME sits up and says nothing t sits up and faces JAIME
Listen to me cunt Till I get what Im owed a dragon doesnt get to kill you You dont get to kill you Only I get to kill you
That was only one of them She has two more If she decides to use them to really use them 
Youre fucked
Dont you mean were fucked
No I do not Dragons are where our partnership ends Im not going to be around when those things start spitting fire on Kings Landing
I have to tell Cersei pauses and looks at JAIME
Best well jump back in that river BRONN stands up and walks away JAIME continues sitting on the shore looking at the smoke and fire from the distant battle BATTLEGROUND TYRION is walking over an ash covered ground There are burned bodies and cargo strewn about Dothraki are looting dead Lannister soldies A group of mounted Dothraki are escorting captured Lannister soldiers to wher and DROGON are awaiting the prisoners addresses the captured soldiers
I know what Cersei has told you that Ive come to destroy your cities The camera pans around the prisoners The men are covered in filth and blood from the battle
burn down your homes murder you and orphan your children Thats Cersei Lannister not me Im not here to murder And all I want to destroy is the wheel that is rolled over rich and poor to the benefit of no one but the Cersei Lannisters of the world I offer you a choice Bend the knee and join me Together we will leave the world a better place than we found it or refuse and die A few Lannister men kneel to the ground while most remain standing DROGON roars and moves closer to the men Almost all the Lannister men quickly kneel while a few still remain standing including RANDYLL and DICKON TARLEY speaks to RANDYLL
Step forward My Lord RANDYLL takes several steps toward and stands in front of the kneeling Lannister men
You will not kneel
I already have a queen
My sister she wasnt your queen until recently though was she until she murdered your rightful queen and destroyed House Tyrell for all time So it appears your allegiances are somewhat flexible
There are no easy choices in war Say what you will about your sister she was born in Westeros has lived here all her life You on the other hand you murdered your own father and chose to support a foreign invader One with no ties to this land an army of savages at her back
You will not trade your honor for your life I respect that turns to speak to DAENERYS
Perhaps he could take the black Your Grace Whatever else he is he is a true soldier He would be invaluable at the Wall
You cannot send me to the Wall You are not my queen DAENERYS turns to look at her Dothraki escort The Dothraki walk forward to collect RANDYLL As the men are pulling RANDYLL awa steps forward
You will have to kill me too pulls away from the Dothraki and turns to face his son
Step back and shut your mouth
Who are you
A stupid boy
Im Dickon Tarley son of Randyll Tarley
You are the future of your house This war has already wiped one great house from the world Dont let it happen again Bend the knee looks to RANDYLL RANDYLL nods to his son
I will not turns to speak to DAENERYS He speaks softly so no one but the queen can hear
Your Grace nothing strips bold notions from a mans head like a few weeks in a dark cell
I meant what I said Im not here to put men in chains If that becomes an option many will take it I gave them a choice They made it
Your Grace if you begin beheading entire families 
Im not beheading anyone pauses and looks over the DROGON DRGON roars and shakes his head and flexes his wings
Your Grace looks to her Dothraki escort and gives a signal The men grab RANDYLL and DICKON and walk them over to DROGON RANDYLL takes DICKON by the arm
Lord Randyll Tarley Dickon Tarley I Daenerys of House Targaryen First of my name Breaker of Chains and Mother of Dragons sentence you to die pauses a moment and looks at RANDYLL and DICKON
Dracarys DROGON draws a deep breath and begins spewing dragonfire at the two men They are instantly engulfed in flames They both collapse into ash after a few seconds There are two craters left where RANDYLL and DICKON stood The Lannister men recoil in horror Any Lannister soldier that was still standing kneels to the ground DAENERYS silently turns and begins to walk off the battlefield HALLWAY JAIME is quickly walking down the hall leading to CERSEIs room As he approaches exits the queens chambers
My Lord JAIME passes by QYBURN without saying a word and barges int s quarters stand and walks over to JAIME
How many men did we lose
We havent done a full counting
Its armies that win wars We have the Tyrell gold we have the Iron Bank behind us We can buy mercenaries
Theyre not the same as our men but theyll fight if theyre well paid which they will be
I just saw the Dothraki fight Theyll beat any mercenary army Theyll beat any army Ive ever seen Killing our men wasnt war for them it was sport Her dragon burned a thousand wagons Qyburns scorpion fired bolts bigger than you They couldnt stop it And she has three of them This isnt a war we can win
So what do we do Sue for peace I sit on her fathers throne the father you betrayed and murdered And in her mind shes winning What sort of offer do you think shed make turns and walks away from JAIME
Maybe we can count on Tyrion to intercede on our behalf by way of apology for murdering our father and our son
He didnt
You saw the crossbow you saw his body walks across the room to where CERSEI is standing
Im not talking about father Tyrion didnt kill Joffrey He had nothing to do with it
After all this time it still amazes me 
It was Olenna She confessed before she died
And this was before or after she drank the poison you so kindly provided her
After
And you believed her
If you were Olenna would you rather have seen your granddaughter married to Joffrey or Tommen Which one would Margerey been better able to control Which one would have made Olenna the true ruler of the Seven Kingdoms She was telling the truth looks away then sits down
I shouldnt have listened to you She should have died screaming
Shes dead like her son her grandchildren her whole house And if we dont find a way out of this war well follow them
So we fight and die or we submit and die I know my choice A soldier should know his
DRAGONSTONE CLIFFS JON SNOW is standing on the edge of a cliff looking towards the ocean DROGON roars and flies over him wit on his back DROGON lands next to JON and charges towards him DROGON opens his jaws and roars in JONs face DROGON creeps closer until he is inches from JON JON removes his glove and slowly extends his hand toward DROGON DROGON lowers his head and allows JON to touch him looks surprised and steps down from her mount DROGON turns and flies away
Theyre beautiful arent they
That wasnt the word I was thinking of but yes they are Gorgeous beasts
Theyre not beasts to me No matter how big they get how terrifying to everyone else theyre my children DAENERYS turns to look at her three dragons as they fly over Dragonstone in the distance
You werent gone long turns back to JON
No
And
And I have fewer enemies today than I did yesterday JON pauses and doesnt say anything
Youre not sure how you feel about that
No Im not turns and starts walking towards the castle JON follows
How many men did your army kill taking Winterfell back from the Boltons
Thousands
We both want to help people We can only help them from a position of strength Sometimes strength is terrible When you first came here Ser Davos said you took a knife in the heart for your people
Ser Davos gets carried away
So it was a figure of speech JON doesnt say anything A group of Dothraki guards approach DAENERYS and speak in their native tongue
This man says he is your friend Khaleesi The guard steps to the side and JORAH MORMONT stands behind him answers the guard in Dothraki
He is my friend kneels before DAENERYS
Your Grace
Jon Snow this is Ser Jorah Mormont an old friend
I served with your father He was a great man JORAH nods to JON
You look strong You found a cure
I wouldnt be here if I hadnt I return to your service my queen if youll have me
It would be my honor DAENERYS steps forward and hugs JORAH
A group of ravens are resting on a tree Several of the ravens eyes wash white They take off and fly over Winterfell They cross frozen fields and over a snowy mountain They arrive at The Wall at Eastwatchbythesea and continue over the Wall The ravens fly many miles over tundra and more mountains The birds crest a hill and thousands of dead men can be seen marching south A group of riders and the Night King are on top of an outcrop watching the dead file past As the ravens approach the Night King peers in their direction and the birds scatter and disperse s eyes are pure white They wash back to their normal color He is sitting in front of the Weirwood Maester Wolkan stands next to him
Ravens We need to send ravens WOLKAN nods his head to BRAN
CITADEL MAESTER COUNCIL CHAMBER ARCHMAESTER MARWYN and other citadel maesters are seated at a council table MARWYN has a raven scroll in his hand and the maesters are discussing the contents SAMWELL enters the room carrying a large stock of books and scrolls MARWYN points SAM to a nearby table to offload the books
I put very little stock in it myself Prophecies of doom are never in short supply especially when winter comes
I remember Wolkan A bit timid but a sharp mind
The north has dulled many good maesters wits Im not sure if its the cold the drink or the company All the maesters chuckle
A crippled boy claims to have seen dead men on the march beyond the wall thanks to the magical help of a raven with three eyes SAM stops working and turns around
It is a bit much Still we ought to 
Brandon Stark The maesters all turn in their seats to look a
the crippled boy
Do you know him
I let him through the Wall years ago I saw him go beyond the wall
And
Somehow a crippled boy survived for years beyond the wall when no one else could Not the Nights Watch not the Wildlings no one Perhaps we ought to listen to what he has to say
Perhaps you need more scribing work to discipline your mind
I sense a more detailed proposal is forthcoming steps forward and clears his throat
Everyone in Westeros trusts and respects you If you tell people the threat is real theyll believe it If you advise all the lords to send their men north to hold the wall theyll do it And if you tell every maester in the Citadel to search every word of every faded scroll about the long night they may find something that lets us defeat the Army of the Dead for good
It could be done And this news could be authentic Its possible Its also possible this message is part of a ploy by the dragon queen to lure southern armies away from the lands they are currently defending to open those lands to easy conquest
That does seem far more likely than magic birds talking to cripples
Archmaester please Its real Ive seen it
We will write to Maester Wolkan at Winterfell for clarification I promise you we will get to the truth of it one way or another
Archmaester 
That will be all Tarley SAM turns to collect his work and leave The maesters begin talking to one another
It brings to mind the work of Davy Moonstone the charlatan who claimed to see the children of the forest The maesters all chuckle
Dont forget the Prophet Lodock that promised the Drowned God would rise up and destroy Aegon the Conquerer The maesters continue laughing SAMWELL gets the last of his work and walks out of the door in disgust turns to look at MARWYN
Is he the one whose father and brother were just burned alive
Im afraid so
Horrible business
I dont have the heart to tell him yet Hes a good lad crumples the raven scroll and throws it dismissevely on the table
Right The ravenry was falling apart last time I checked VARYS an are sitting on the stairs of the Throne Room alone VARYS has a sealed raven scroll in his hand tapping it on the stone is drinking a glass of wine having a discussion with VARYS
All rulers demand that people bend the knee Its why theyre rulers She gave Tarley a choice A man who had taken up arms against her What else could she do
Not burn him alive alongside his son
I am her hand not her head I cant make her decisions for her
Thats what I used to tell myself about her father I found the traitors but I wasnt the one burning them alive I was only a purveyor of information reaches over to TYRIONs cup of wine picks it up and begins to drink from it He grimaces as he drinks
Its what I told myself when I watched them beg for mercy Im not the one doing it As the pitch of their screams rose higher Im not the one doing it When their hair caught fire and the smell of the burning flesh filled the Thone Room Im not the one doing it VARYS drinks again and sets the cup down next t picks it up
Daenerys is not her father
And she never will be with the right counsel You need to find a way to make her listen looks down at the note in VARYSs hand
Who is that for
Jon Snow
Did you read it
Its a sealed scroll for the King in the North pauses and drinks from his cup of wine
Whats it say
Nothing good DAENERYS and VARYS are seated at the painted table TYRION and JORAH stand near the queen DAVOS an SNOW are standing on the other end of the table is holding a raven scroll and reading it
I thought Arya was dead I thought Bran was dead
Im happy for you You dont look happy
Bran saw the Night King and his army marching towards Eastwatch If they make it past the wall 
The Wall has kept them out for thousands of years Presumably interrupts VARYS
I need to go home
You said you dont have enough men
Well fight with the men we have Unless youll join us
And give the country to Cersei As soon as I march away she marches in
Perhaps not Cersei thinks the Army of the Dead is nothing but a story made up by wet nurses to frighten children What if we prove her wrong
I dont think shell come see the dead at my invitation begins walking around the table closer to JON
So bring the dead to her
I thought that was what we are trying to avoid
We dont have to bring the whole army Only one soldier
Is that possible
The first White I ever saw was brought into Castle Black from beyond the Wall
Bring one of these things down to Kings Landing and show her the truth
Anything you bring back will be useless unless Cersei grants us an audience and is somehow convinced not to murder us the moment we set foot in the capital
The only person she listens to is Jaime He may listen to me
And how would you get into Kings Landing Everyone in the room stops and looks a
I can smuggle you in but if the Goldcloaks were to recognize you Im warning you Im not a fighter TYRION nods his head
Well it will all be for nothing if we dont have one of these dead men
Fair point How do you propose to find one JON pauses and stares at the ground breaks the silence
With the queens permission Ill go north and take one DAENERYS turns to look a
You asked me to find a cure so I could serve you Allow me to serve you
The free folk will help us They know the real north better than anyone
They wont follow Ser Jorah
They wont have to
You cant lead a raid beyond the wall Youre not in the Nights Watch anymore Youre King in the North
Im the only one here whose fought them Im the only one here who knows them
I havent given you permission to leave
With respect Your Grace I dont need your permission I am a king And I came here knowing that you could have your men behead me or your dragons burn me alive I put my trust in you a stranger because I knew it was the best chance for my people for all our people Now Im asking you to trust in a stranger because its our best chance DAENERYS pauses for a moment then nods her head in agreement THE GREAT HALL Northen lords includin GLOVER YOHN ROYCE and are congregated in the Great Hall ARYA walks into the room and hears a loud discussion The lords are adressing SANSA who is seated at the head table
ing in the North should stay in the north We did not choose you to rule us My Lady but perhaps we should have The men agree in unison ROYCE stands up and walks in front of SANSA
nights of the Vale came here for you Lady Stark
Youre very kind my lords but Jon is our king He is doing what he thinks is best The men sit down and everyone in the hall begins talking to one another HALL and ARYA are walking through the hall t s quarters having a discussion
I warned Jon this would happen He cant leave the north and expect it to just sit and wait for him like Ghost
He didnt He trusted you to hold it for him
Well hes not making it easy The northern lords are proud The girls arrive at SANSAs quarters is glancing around the room
These are mother and fathers chambers
And
Nothing
Dont do that SANSA turns around to fac
What
Say what you mean
You always liked nice things It made you feel better than everyone drops the papers in her hand on a table and looks at ARYA
Are you angry with me
They were insulting Jon and you sat there and listened
I listened to their complaints which is my responsibility as Lady of Winterfell
Their opinions are important to you
Glover has 500 men Royce has 2000 Offend them and Jon loses his army
Not if they lose their heads first
Winterfell didnt just fall into our hands We took it back and the Mormonts and the Hornwoods and the Wildlings and the Vale all of us working together Now Im sure cutting off heads is very satisfying but thats not the way you get people to work together
And if Jon doesnt come back youll need their support so you can work together to give you what you really want
How can you even think such a horrible thing
Youre thinking it right now You dont want to be but the thought just wont go away and ARYA stare at each in silence for a moment
I have work to do SANSA turns and walks away fro
My lady ARYA exits the room BEACH DAVOS an are standing on the beach of Kings Landing DAVOS is securing a small row boat is looking up towards the city walls
Last time I was here I killed my father with a crossbow
Last time I was here you killed my son with wildfire TYRION turns to look a walks next to TYRION and stakes the boat anchor into the sand
Theres a path to the left that hugs the cliff The guards hardly ever patrol it Too many steps begins walking towards the path DAVOS follows him and quickly takes the lead stops and looks back towards the unattended boat
Youre not staying here
Ive got my own business in Flea Bottom
What if someone takes the boat
Then were fucked Best hurry
REDKEEP DUNGEONS BRONN an are walking by the dragon skulls Both men have sparring swords in their hand
We dont have time for this We should be preparing the city for a siege The Dothraki are coming
All the more reason for you to train Unless you plan on fighting Dothraki 12 year olds
I seem to recall them giving you a bit of trouble as well
And here I am ready to train
Why down here
I dont think you want people to see how you look swinging that thing yet
Today might be the day I kill you by accident
Oh you wont be swinging it at me stops walking and holds his torch out TYRION steps from around a pillar and looks at JAIME JAIME looks angrily a
Ill leave you to it BRONN turns and walks away leaving JAIME an alone
I needed to see you and I knew youd never agree to meet JAIME remains silent and stares a
You made me look like a complete fool I thought Id surprise you by hitting Casterly Rock but you were three steps ahead of me You abandoned the family home Completely unsentimental Father would have been proud
Dont talk about our father
Listen to me 
I once told Bronn that if I ever saw you again Id cut you in half glances down at the sword in JAIMEs hand
It would take you awhile with a sparring sword JAIME shakes his head and says nothing
He was going to execute me He knew I was innocent He didnt hate me because of anything I did he hated me because of what I am The little monster sent to punish him Do you think I wanted to be born this way Did he think I chose 
What do you want
Daenerys will win this war Youre a military man You must know there is no way around it Daenerys is not her father Shes even willing to suspend hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms
You want Cersei to bend the knee you can ask her yourself
I I dont Daenerys doesnt Not right now anyway She has a more important request FLEA BOTTOM Men are in the market selling their wares A blacksmith sharpens a sword on a grinding wheel is walking through the market glancing around A man in a blacksmith shop pulls a sword from the fire and begins to hammer it on his anvil walks into the shop
I wasnt sure Id find you The blacksmith puts the sword down and turns around revealing GENDRY the bastard son of Robert Baratheon
I thought you might still be rowing GENDRY chuckles an smiles
I looked in shops taverns brothels I should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel
Werent you worried about the Goldcloaks
I havent been here in years Why should they recognize me Sometimes I hardly do Nothing fucks you harder than time walks to the side of the shop and inspects a rack of swords He pulls one nods in approval and puts it back in its place He turns back to GENDRY
Anybody give you any trouble
Here I am arming Lannisters I never get a second look You were right Safest place for me was right under the queens nose
Dont be so sure Safety is never a permanent state of affairs Bad things are coming nods
You came to get me You want me to come with you
I think you need to understand 
Im ready Lets go
You should know what youre heading into
Dont you think Ive been thinking about it every swing of the hammer how happy I am making weapons for the family that killed my father They tried to kill me is tossing his tools and apron to the side He picks up a satchel and swings it over his head
Ive been getting ready I never knew what for but Ive always known Id know it when it comes
You might want to bring one of those swords smiles at DAVOS and begins walking towards the weapons
I dont know much about swinging swords but this removes a giant war hammer from the wall
this I know GENDRY an turn and walk out of the shop BEAC and GENDRY are walking towards the boa left on the beach
Keep your fathers name to yourself The situation is complicated enough already and DAVOS arrive at the boat lays his hammer on top of the boat cargo DAVOS is gathering the anchor and rope Two Goldcloaks begin walking down the beach towards the boat unnoticed by DAVOS an
Who should I say I am turns and notices the two guards approaching the boat He turns and loudly addresses GENDRY
I told you Clovis if we dont get out of here soon someone is going to 
You there Both guards have their hands on their weapons ready to draw starts walking towards the guards and spreads his cloak open GENDRY remains by the boat
No weapons friends I promise What can I do for you
Is that your boat
It is GENDRY looks down into the boat and sees his weapon in plain view
The docks are that way
That they are I try to stay away from them to avoid good men such as yourselves The two guards look at each other and chuckle retrieves a coin purse and opens it
Still five gold dragons
Are you joking
You must be even older than you look 15
15
Apiece angrily reaches into his pouch and pays the men
I cant say it was a pleasure doing business with you DAVOS turns and begins walking back to his boat
Whats in the boat pauses and turns back to the guards
Not more gold
Wine
Mmm
I like wine
Or hams
Come and have a look The guards walk over to the boat As they approach walks to the boat and pulls a cover to reveal the cargo As he pulls back the canvas he throws it over GENDRYs exposed weapon covering it from view There are several baskets of fermented meat The guards twist their faces in disgust
Fermented crab
What
Fermented crab One bucket of this triples the brothels earnings for the week A man thinks hes done hes ready to go back to his loving family but before he gets his britches up his lady of the hour pops a tiny spoon of that into his mouth Five minutes later hes back in the race Here have a taste scoops up a bit of fermented crab and offers it to the guards Both men reach out and take a pinch The guards sniff the crab and put it in their mouth They both recoil from the taste and look at each other
Id hurry to your favorite establishment or youll put a whole in that chainmail The guards and DAVOS laugh The guards turn and start walking back towards the city GENDRY nods at them as they go TYRION appears at the top of the stairs leading to the beach The Goldcloaks see him as hes walking down the path TYRION walks by the guards and they exchange glances The guards stop and turn back toward the boat
Oi Dwarf quickly walks to cut the guards off
I really wouldnt try anymore until you see how the first bite hits you
That dwarf The guards blow past DAVOS and begin talking to TYRION
Where did you get that scar
Fish hook Some men you just cant teach
We was looking for a dwarf with a scar like that awhile back is still standing behind the guards He retrieves his gold pouch again and holds it up shaking it
Perhaps theres some arrangement The two guards turn back to DAVOS
Arrangement You gonna arrange to pay us more than Queen Cersei GENDRY can be seen behind the backs of the guards He slowly retrieves his hammer and creeps up behind GUARD 2 He swings his hammer and connects with the side of the guards head The man drops As GENDRY transitions onto the second guard and swings his hammer GUARD 1 turns to look and catches a hammer blow to the face is looking at TYRION and motions towards GENDRY
This is Gendry
Hell do The men grab onto the boat and begin to push it into the water
REDKEEP s QUARTERS JAIME opens the door and step into the queens room is seated near a window speaking to QYBURN
That wont be necessary bows his head and walks to leave the room As he passes by JAIME he addresses him
Ser Jaime QYBURN closes the door as he leaves and CERSEI are alone CERSEI begins walking over to a chair in front o and sits
Why was QYBURN here
Hes Hand of the Queen Why are you here
I met with Tyrion pauses for a moment making JAIME uncomfortable
What did our brother have to say
Daenerys wants to meet
To discuss a surrender
To discuss an armistice
She just won a great victory Why would she want a truce now
Because an army of dead men is marching on the Seven Kingdoms Tyrion claims hell have proof smirks and looks away from JAIME
Are you going to punish him
Tyrion
Bronn JAIME looks confused
He betrayed you He set up a meeting without your knowledge or consent Do you think anything of importance happens in this city without me knowing
You let it happen Why
Ive come to believe that accomodation with the Dragon Queen could be in our immediate interest She has the numbers If we want to beat her we have to be clever We have to fight her like father would have Dead men dragons and Dragon Queens whatever stands in our way we will defeat it ourselves for our house For this CERSEI lifts her hands from the chair and places them both on her stomach indicating shes pregnant looks shocked
Who will you say is the father
You
People wont like that stands from her chair and walks in front of JAIME
Do you remember what father used to say about people
The lion doesnt concern himself with the opinions of the sheep JAIME reaches forward and take and kisses her While they embrac speaks to JAIME
Never betray me again GENDRY an are walking down the beach near the Dragonglass cave Groups of men are carrying boxes filled with Dragonglass out of the cave and GENDRY are having a discussion
Were leaving today The kings got a lot on his mind
I understand
He doesnt need to be thinking about harboring the bastard of a dead king
You dont have to worry
Youre just Clovis a smith whos come to pay his respects before he heads off to work at the Winterfell forges
Understood and GENDRY enter the mouth of the cave JON is walking along the corridor
Begging your pardon Your Grace stops and turns around to face DAVOS
You survived Kings Landing
Yet again
Your Grace this is steps forward in front of DAVOS
Its Gendry Your Grace Im Robert Baratheons son Bastard son JON looks t
He was meant to keep that to himself
Our fathers trusted each other Why shouldnt we
I saw your father once at Winterfell
I met yours in my shop
Youre a lot leaner
Youre a lot shorter stops smiling and pauses a moment Then he chuckles
I grew up on stories about them
All I ever knew was they fought together and won Ser Davos told me where youre going Your Grace and why Let me come with you
Dont be a fool Youre not a soldier
No but Im a fighter And he wont be needing a smith with a sword like that
Do you know how to use one GENDRY shakes his head
Well thats a problem
I prefer a hammer GENDRY looks t
He can handle himself nods
We could use the help
As my father used to say its better to be a coward for a minute than dead for the rest of your life
I owe you my life Twice over But if what you said is true about whats out there I cant wait out this war
Yeah Nobody mind me All Ive ever done is live to a ripe old age Two landing boats are sitting on the beach surrounded by two groups of men A large sailboat is anchored in the bay JORAH places his sword and a case of Dragonglass into the boat walks down the beach and stands next to JORAH
You may not believe it but Ive missed you Mormont Nobody glowers quite like you Not even Grey Worm retrieves a gold coin from his pocket and turns it in his hands
This is the coin the slaver gave me when I suggested he free us and pay us Remember
It was supposed to last us the rest of our lives smiles and hands the coin to JORAH
Take it with you Youll bring it back Our queen needs you JORAH nods to TYRION appears and walks up to JORAH
We should be better at saying farewell by now
Your Grace I DAENERYS reaches forward and takes JORAH by his hands SNOW DAVOS and GENDRY exit the cave and walk towards the boats JORAH bends and kisses DAENERYs hand He turns and continues readying the boat stands in front of DAENERYS
If I dont return at least you wont have to deal with the King in the North anymore
But Ive grown used to him
I wish you good fortune in the wars to come Your Grace DAENERYS nods t turns and walks to the head of the boat The men take hold of it
Heave The men push the boat into the sea DAENERYS and TYRION remain on the beach watching them go
CITADEL SAMWELLs QUARTERS SAM is seated at a table surround by papers and candles He is writing notes into a book Gilly is seated across from him reading aloud from a tome SAM JR is playing on the bed
Do you know how many steps there are in the Citadel
No
15782 SAM looks up from his work annoyed He remains silent and continues working
Guess how many windows are in the Great Sept of Baelor looks away and pauses
None anymore
Thats true This High Septon Meynard he recorded everything He even recorded his own bowel movements What does annulment mean
Its when a man sets asside his lawful wife
Meynard says here that he issued an anullment for Prince Rhaegar and remarried him to someone else at the same time in a secret ceremony in Dorne Is that a common thing isnt paying much attention to GILLY He loudly interrupts her
These maesters they set me to the task of preserving that mans window counting and anullments and bowel movements for all eternity while the secret to defeating the Night Kings probably sitting on some dusty shelf somewhere completely ignored But thats all right isnt it We could all become slavering murderous imbecils enthralled to evil incarnate as long as we can have access to the full records of High Septon Meynards 15782 shits
Steps That number was steps SAMWELL is dismayed He sets his quill down and grabs the book he was writing in and hands it to SAM Jr He retrieves his cloak and walks out the door
CITADEL LIBRARY SAM is walking through a dark library He heads to the restricted section and unlocks the barred gate He begins removing books and scrolls from shelfs and stuff them in his satchel After retrieving what he needs SAM quickly walks to the exit of the library He pauses before he leaves and turns around He glances back at the library It is many stories tall lined with countless shelves of books SAMWELL looks at the library one last time turns and walks out of the door
CITADEL SAMWELL is loading a wagon with his things He walks around to the driver seat and SAM JR are already in the wagon dressed for the road SAM climbs aboard and takes the reins in his hand
Are you sure you want to do this You always wanted to be a maester
Im tired of reading about the achievements of better men The horse neighs and begins pulling the carriage away from the city The Citadel can be seen with a torch burning bright on top of the tallest tower ARYA is in the kennels observing PETER BAELISH and a Winterfell servant having a conversation The servent is whispering in BAELISHs ear ARYA cant hear the conversation ARYA sees BAELISH hand the servant a raven scroll The servant turns to leave BAELISH senses someone is watching him and he looks to where ARYA stood but she has already vanished BAELISH turns and leaves the kennels ARYA is on the upper level looking down at BAELISH He is having a conversation with ROBETT GLOVER and YOHN ROYCE She cant hear whats being said BAELISH finishes his conversation and walks away from the men ARYA disappears behind the corner and continues following BAELISH HALLS ARYA is walking down the hallway She pauses peers around a corner and looks towards the door of BAELISHs quarters BAELISH appears and unlocks his door Before he walks in MAESTE approaches him She continues watching the men
I found it my Lord hands BAELISH a raven scroll
It took some searching Maester Llewyns archives are thorough reads the note then looks at WOLKAN
Are you sure this is the only copy at Winterfell
Yes my Lord
Lady Stark thanks you for your service WOLKAN turns and walks away BAELISH enters his room and shuts the door ARYA continues watching A moment later BAELISH opens the door and exits the room locking the door as he leaves After he is gone ARYA walks to the door and produces a lockpick from her sleeve She enters the room and begins searching for the raven scroll She opens a cabinet but finds nothing of value She checks another cabinet then looks in the fireplace and above the mantle finding nothing She lifts up the mattress and finds a small hole cut into the bedding She reaches in and retrives the raven scroll She unrolls it and reads the contents Robb I write to you with a heavy heart Our good king Robert is dead killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt Father has been charged with treason He conspired with Roberts brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne The Lannisters are treating me very well and provide me with every comfort
come to Kings Landing swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark Your faithfull sister Sansa Arya rerolls the note and exits the room She locks the door behind her and leaves the hallway After a moment BAELISH emerges from a dark corner watching ARYA with a smirk on his face
EASTWATCH BEACH JON and the raiding party land on the Beach of Eastwatch JON looks up at the castle The men collect their equipment and make for the castle
INT EASTWATCH GREAT HAL  JON DAVOS GENDRY and JORAH sit at a table having a conversation
Isnt it your job to talk him out of stupid fucking ideas like this
Ive been failing at that job of late
How many queens are there now

And you need to convince the one with the dragons or the one who fucks her brother
Both
How many men did you bring looks around the table
Not enough
The big woman JON smiles and shakes his head TORMUND is disappointed
We were hoping some of your men could help
Ill be staying behind Im a liability out there as you well know nods his head
You are turns to look at JON
You really want to go out there again JON nods
Youre not the only ones
EASTWATCH CELLS The raiding party walk down to the Eastwatch cells is leading them
My scouts found them a mile south of the Wall Said they were on their way here The men look into the cells It is occupied by SANDOR CLEGANE THOROS of MYR and BERIC DONDARRION
Youre The Hound I saw you once at Winterfell SANDOR pulls a blanket tight around himself and sits up from the table he was laying on
They want to go beyond the Wall too
We dont want to go beyond the Wall we have to Our lord told us the great war is coming
Dont trust them Dont trust any of them The men turn to look a walks up and presses his face to the bars of the cell
Theyre the Brotherhood And the last thing their Lord told them to do was sell me to a Red Witch to be murdered
Thoros THOROS sits up from a dark corner
I hardly recognized you
Ser Jorah Mormont TORMUND turns and angrily looks at JORAH
They wont give me anything to drink down here I havent been feeling like myself
Youre a fucking Mormont Like the last Lord Commander
He was my father
He hunted us like animals
You returned the favor as I recall
Here we all are at the edge of the world at the same moment heading in the same direction for the same reason
Our reasons arent your reasons
It doesnt matter what we think our reasons are stands up and walks towards the bars of the cell
Theres a greater purpose at work and we serve it together whether we know it or not We may take the steps but the Lord of Light 
For fucks sake will you shut your hole Are we coming with you or not
Dont you want to know what were doing
Is it worse than sitting in a freezing cell waiting to die
Hes right Were all on the same side
How can we be
Were all breathing TORMUND hands the cell keys to JON JON opens the door and let the men out
A raiding party consisting o SNOW TORMUND GENDRY BRATHEON JORAH MORMONT SANDOR CLEGANE BERIC DONDARRIAN THOROS of MYR and several Wildlings are ranging beyond the wall of EastwatchbytheSea The men trek through a frozen valley filled with jagged rocks The Wildlings are pulling a sled loaded with gear and provisions The camera shifts and the men are climbing a steep mountain covered in snow
Are you all right GENDRY face and grunts
Ever been north before
Never seen snow before
Beautiful eh I can breath again Down south the air smells like pig shit
Youve never been down south
Ive been to Winterfell
Thats the north The group of men continue north A Wildling scout is ahead of the group surveying the area
How do you live up here How do you keep your balls from freezing off
You have to keep moving Thats the secret Walking is good fighting is better fucking is best
Theres not another woman within 100 miles of here turns to look at JON and GENDRY
We have to make due with what weve got JON glances at GENDRY GENDRY backs away from JON an
This one is maybe not so smart
Davos says he is a strong fighter
Good Thats more important than being smart looks at JON as they continue to walk
Smart people dont come up here looking for the dead So you met this Dragon Queen huh And
Shell only fight beside us if I bend the knee
You spent too much time with the free folk and now you dont like kneeling Mance Rayder was a great man a proud man The king beyond the wall never bent the knee How many of his people died for his pride The camera pans out to a frozen vista The men are walking across broken slabs of ice and tundra There are mountains and a lake of ice in the distance The view shifts to GENDRY walking along wit  BERIC and SANDOR is carrying his wine flask
Are you still mad at us boy
You sold me to a witch
Priestess Ill admit it is a subtle distinction
Were fighting a great war Wars cost money
I wanted to be one of you I wanted to join the Brotherhood but you sold me off like a slave Do you know what she did to me She strapped me down on a bed she stripped me naked 
Sounds all right so far
and put leeches on me
Was she naked too
She needed your blood
Yes Thank you I know that steps in front of GENDRY to halt him
It could have been worse
She wanted to kill me They would have killed me if it wasnt for Davos 
But they didnt did they So what you whinging about
Im not whinging
Your lips are moving and youre complaining about something Thats whinging motions to BERIC
This ones been killed six times You dont hear him bitching about it SANDOR walks away to join the group BERIC an smile to each other holds his wine flask out to GENDRY who takes a large gulp and hands it back t
Good lad The camera shifts to the head of the line is walking with JORAH
The first time I went north of the wall was with your father
He was a good man He deserved a better son Were you with him at the end
I was a prisoner of the Wildlings But we avenged him I want you to know that every mutineer found justice
I cant think of a worse way for him to go The Nights Watch was his life He would have died to protect every one of those men and they butchered him
I hate that he died that way My father was the most honorable man I ever met He was good all the way through And he died on the executioners block
Your father wanted to execute me
I heard
He was in the right of course It didnt make me hate him any less JORAH an glance at each other
Im glad he didnt capture you
Me too stops walking and loosens the belt holding his sword
Your father gave me this sword He changed the pommel from a bear to a wolf but its still Long Claw hands the sword to JORAH JORAH slowly takes the sword and looks it over in his hands
Lord Commander Mormont thought youd never come back to Westeros JORAH stops examining the sword and looks up t
But you are back and its been in your family for centuries Its not right for me to have it pauses then nods at JON
He gave it to you
Im not his son pulls the sword halfway out of the sheath and inspects the blade turning it in his hands
I brought shame to my house I broke my fathers heart resheaths the blade and hands it back to JON
I forfeited the right to claim this sword Its yours May it serve you well and your children after you Snow is falling into the courtyard The ground is covered with several inches of snow Several braziers are burning and a servant carries a bucket of steaming water across the grounds is standing on the upper level looking into the courtyard SANSA approaches her from behind
Father used to watch us from up here He wouldnt say much You probably dont remember You were inside knitting all the time
I remember
One time the boys were shooting arrows with Ser Rodrick I came out here after and Bran had left his bow behind just lying on the ground Ser Rodrick would have cuffed him if he saw There was one arrow in the target There was no one around just like now No one to stop me So I started shooting And every shot I had to go out there and get my one arrow and walk back and shoot it again I wasnt very good Finally I hit the bullseye It could have been the 20th shot or the 50th I dont remember But I hit the bullseye and I heard this starts a slow clap
I looked up and hes standing right here smiling down at me I knew what I was doing was against the rules But he was smiling so I knew it wasnt wrong The rules were wrong I was doing what I was meant to be doing and he knew it Now hes dead Killed by the Lannisters with your help turns to look at ARYA
What retrieves a raven scroll from her pocket and unrolls it
Thats your pretty handwriting Septa Mordane used to crack my knuckles because I couldnt write as well as you Robb I write to you today with heavy heart Our good King Robert is dead Killed from wounds he took in a boar hunt 
You dont have to read it I remember
Father has been charged with treason He conspired with Roberts brothers against my beloved Joffrey and tried to steal his throne The Lannisters are treating me well and providing me with every comfort I beg you come to Kings Landing swear fealty to King Joffrey and prevent any strife between the great houses of Lannister and Stark Your faithful sister Sansa
They forced me to do it
Did they With a knife at your throat Did they put you on a rack and stretch you until your bones started to pop
You dont know what it was like I was a child
So was I I would have let them kill me before I betrayed my family
They told me it was the only way to save father
And you were stupid enough to believe them I remember you standing on that platform with Joffrey and Cersei when they dragged father too the block I remember the pretty dress you were wearing I remember the fancy way you did your hair
You were there
I was there standing in the crowd near Baelors statue
And what did you do Did you come running to the rescue Did you fight off the Lannisters and save father
I wanted to
But you didnt Just like me
I didnt betray him I didnt betray Robb I didnt betray our entire family for my beloved Joffrey
You should be on your knees thanking me Were standing in Winterfell again because of me You didnt win it back Jon didnt win it back He lost the Battle of the Bastards nights of the Vale won the battle and they rode north for me while you were off where traveling the world
I was training
Training Well while you were training I suffered things you can never imagine
Oh I dont know about that I can imagine quite a lot
You never would have survived what I survived
I guess well never know
What are you doing to do with that letter
I dont know yet
Who did you show it to Where did you find it
Youre scared arent you What are you scared of You didnt commit any crimes No ones going to hang you
Arya 
Are you scared Ill show it to Jon and hell be angry No Thats not Jon Hell understand You were just a scared little girl all alone with the wicked Lannisters
Do you know how happy Cersei would be if she saw us fighting This is exactly what she wants This is what shes always wanted to tear us apart 
The northern lords will read it They wouldnt think much of Lady Sansa if they knew how she did Cerseis bidding What would little Lyanna Mormont say Shes younger than you were when you wrote this Are you going to say But I was just a child 
Youre angry Sometimes anger makes people do unfortunate things
Sometimes fear makes them do unfortunate things Ill go with anger ARYA turns and walks away
The raiding party are marching single file acorss the frozen tundra SANDOR stops to tie a fur cover over his boot that came loose approaches him
Youre the one they call the dog
Fuck off
They told me you were mean Were you born mean or you just hate Wildlings
I dont give two shits about Wildlings looks up at TORMUND
Gingers I hate
Gingers are beautiful We are kissed by fire Just like you TORMUND points and motions t s burned face slaps his hand away
Dont point your fucking finger at me SANDOR walks away to rejoin the group begins smiling and walks after him
Did you trip into the fire when you were a baby
I didnt trip I was pushed
Ever since youve been mean
Will you fuck off
I dont think youre truly mean You have sad eyes stops and turns to TORMUND
Do you want to suck my dick Is that it
Dick
Cock
Ah Dick I like it
I bet you do SANDOR turns and begins walking follows
Nope Its pussy for me I have a beauty waiting for me back at Winterfell If I ever get back there Yellow hair Blue eyes Tallest woman youve ever seen Almost as tall as you stops and glances at TORMUND
Brienne of Tarth
You know her
Youre with Brienne of fucking Tarth
Well not with her yet but I see the way she looks at me
How does she look at you Like she wants to carve you up and eat your liver nods
You do know her
Weve met SANDOR an begin walking
I want to make babies with her Think of the great big monsters Theyd conquer the world
How did a mad fucker like you live this long
Im good at killing people The camera shifts to the middle of the line JON an are walking together
You dont much look like him
Whos that
Your father I suppose you favor your mother
You knew him
Of course I did When he was Hand he sent me off hunting for The Mountain Your Wildling friend told me the red woman brought you back Thoros has brought me back six times We both serve the same lord
I serve the north
The north didnt raise you from the dead
The lord of light never spoke to me I dont know anything about him I dont know what he wants from me
He wants you alive
Why
I dont know
Thats all anyone can tell me I dont know So whats the point in serving a god that none of us knows what he wants
I think about that all the time I dont think its our purpose to understand except one thing Were soldiers We have to know what were fighting for Im not fighting so some man or woman I barely know can sit on a throne made of swords
So what are you fighting for
Life Death is the enemy The first enemy and the last
But we all die
The enemy always wins And we still need to fight him Thats all I know You and I wont find much joy while were here But we can keep others alive We can defend those who cant defend themselves
I am the shield that guards the realms of men
Maybe we dont need to understand any more than that Maybe thats enough
Aye Maybe thats enough stops and looks into the distance There is a steep mountain ascending into the clouds in the distance
Thats what I saw in the fire points towards the mountain
A mountain like an arrowhead
Are you sure turns to THOROS and nods his head
Were getting close The men start walking towards the base of the mountain TYRION is sitting in a chair staring into the fire stands across the room next to the painted table
Do you know what I like about you turns to look at DAENERYS
I honestly dont
Youre not a hero
Oh Ive been heroic on occasion DAENERYS walks over to the fire and sits in the chair opposite fro
I once charged through the mud gate of Kings Landing
I dont want you to be a hero Heroes do stupid things and they die Drogo Jorah Dario even this Jon Snow they all try to outdo each other of who can do the stupidist bravest thing
Its interesting these heroes you name Drogo Jorah Dario even this Jon Snow they all fell in love with you
Jon Snows not in love with me
Oil
Pitch my lord
How many barrels
500 my lord
Get 500 more
Yes my lord
I still enjoy it when they call me my lord
The thrill will fade
If we live that long Men without cocks You wouldnt find me fighting in an army if I had no cock Whats left to fight for
Gold
I spent my life around soldiers What do you think they spend that gold on
Family
Not without a cock you dont
Maybe it really is all cocks in the end
Yet your brother
Yes hes always been a champion of the downtrodden
I think were about to be the downtrodden
Archers stand tall
Cover that wall
How many people live here
A million give or take
Thats more people than the entire North crammed into that Why would anyone want to live that way
Theres more work in the city And the brothels are far superior
Why isnt she with them
Im afraid I dont know Your Grace No one has seen her
And the rest of them
Theyre on their way to the dragon pit now
Including our brother
Yes Your Grace
If anything goes wrong kill the silverhaired bitch first then our brother then the bastard who calls himself king
Why did they build it
Dragons dont understand the difference between what is theirs and what isnt Land livestock children Letting them roam free around a city was a problem
I imagine it was a sad joke at the end An entire arena for a few sickly creatures smaller than dogs But in the beginning when it was home to Balerion the Dread it must have been the most dangerous place in the world
Maybe it still is
Welcome my lords Your friends arrived before you did
Ive been sent to escort you all to the meeting
A pleasant surprise in an unpleasant situation
I never thought Id see you again my lord
Supporting the enemy no less
Hard to blame you
Cersei will anyway
Im glad youre alive
Come on You can suck his magic cock later
Whats in there
Fuck off
I thought you were dead
Not yet You came pretty close
I was only trying to protect her
You and me both
Shes alive Arya
Where
Winterfell
Whos protecting her if youre here
The only one that needs protecting is the one that gets in her way
It wont be me
Here we are the heroes of Blackwater Bay Strange place for a reunion
It is my lord
I dont think Im anyones lord anymore Podrick Save the titles for Ser Bronn of the Blackwater
Im sure your new queen
Youve been thinking about our new queen
And that would be double what now exactly
Dont you worry about me Im doing all right Looking after myself
Are you Helping me to arrange this meeting wasnt exactly looking after yourself was it You put yourself at risk
I put yourself at risk Important difference Its your head Queen Cerseis offered a bag of gold for its not mine Now thanks to me shes got two traitors heads coming right through her door She can lop them both off as soon as she gets tired of the clever words that pour out their pieholes All thanks to Ser Bronn of the fucking Blackwater If thats not looking after myself I dont know what is
Its good to see you again
Yeah you too
Anyone touches it Ill kill you first
Come on Pod Lets you and me go have a drink while the fancy folks talk eh
I left this shit city because I didnt want to die in it Am I going to die in this shit city
You might
And this is all your idea Seems every bad idea has some Lannister cunt behind it
And some Clegane cunt to help them see it through
Remember me Yeah you do Youre even fucking uglier than I am now What did they do to you Doesnt matter Thats not how it ends for you brother
Where is she
Shell be here soon
Didnt travel with you
No
Weve been here for some time
My apologies
We are all facing a unique
Theon I have your sister
I think we ought to begin with larger concerns
Then why are you talking Youre the smallest concern here
Do you remember when we discussed dwarf jokes His wasnt even good He explained it at the end Never explain It always ruins it
We dont even let your kind live in the Iron Islands you know We kill you at birth An act of mercy for the parents
Perhaps you ought to sit down
Why
Sit down or leave
We are a group of people who do not like one another as this recent demonstration has shown We have suffered at each others hands We have lost people we love at each others hands If all we wanted was more of the same there would be no need for this gathering We are entirely capable of waging war against each other without meeting facetoface
So instead we should settle our differences and live together in harmony for the rest of our days
We all know that will never happen
Then why are we here
This isnt about living in harmony Its just about living The same thing is coming for all of us A general you cant negotiate with An army that doesnt leave corpses behind on the battlefield Lord Tyrion tells me a million people live in this city Theyre about to become a million more soldiers in the Army of the Dead
I imagine for most of them it would be an improvement
This is serious I wouldnt be here if it werent
I dont think its serious at all I think its another bad joke If my brother Jaime has informed me correctly youre asking me for a truce
Yes Thats all
Thats all Pull back my armies and stand down while you go on your monster hunt Or while you solidify and expand your position Hard for me to know which it is with my armies pulled back until you return and march on my capital with four times the men
Your capital will be safe until the northern threat is dealt with You have my word
The word of a wouldbe usurper
There is no conversation that will erase the last 50 years We have something to show you
We can destroy them by burning them
And we can destroy them with dragonglass If we dont win this fight then that is the fate of every person in the world
There is only one war that matters the Great War And it is here
I didnt believe it until I saw them I saw them all
How many
A hundred thousand at least
Can they swim
No
Good Im taking the Iron Fleet back to the Iron Islands
What are you talking about
Ive been around the world Ive seen everything things you couldnt imagine and this this is the only thing Ive ever seen that terrifies me
Im going back to my island You should go back to yours When winters over well be the only ones left alive
Hes right to be afraid And a coward to run If those things come for us there will be no kingdoms to rule Everything we suffered will have been for nothing Everything we lost will have been for nothing The crown accepts your truce Until the dead are defeated they are the true enemy
In return
Just the King
I would never ask it of you You would never agree to it And if you did I would trust you even less than I do now I ask it only of Ned Starks son I know Ned Starks son
I am true to my word Or I try to be That is why I cannot give you what you ask I cannot serve two queens And I have already pledged myself to Queen Daenerys of House Targaryen
Then there is nothing left to discuss The dead will come north first Enjoy dealing with them We will deal with whatever is left of you
Ser Jaime
Its been good to see you I imagine the next time will be across a battlefield
We both saw what just happened We both saw that thing
Yes and Im not looking forward to seeing more of them But Im loyal to the queen and youre loyal to Sansa and her dolt brother
Oh fuck loyalty
Fuck loyalty
This goes beyond houses and honor and oaths Talk to the queen
And tell her what
I wish you hadnt done that
Im grateful for your loyalty but my dragon died so that we could be here If its all for nothing then he died for nothing
I know
Im pleased you bent the knee to our queen
Im not going to swear an oath I cant uphold Talk about my father
That is indeed a problem The more immediate problem is that were fucked
Any ideas as to how we might change that state of affairs
Only one Everyone stays here and I go and talk to my sister
I didnt come all this way to have my Hand
I dont want Cersei to murder me either I could have stayed in my cell and saved a great deal of trouble
I did this I should go
Shell definitely murder you I go see my sister
You spoke with her
At her until she kicked me out She thinks I was an idiot to trust you A lot of people seem to think that actually
Im about to step into a room with the most murderous woman in the world whos already tried to kill me twice that I know of Whos an idiot
I suppose we should say goodbye one idiot to another
I shouldnt be surprised I suppose Shes your kind of woman a foreign whore who doesnt know her place
A foreign whore you cant abduct beat or intimidate That must be difficult for you
So you bring her here with her pet Northerner whom youve convinced to bow down before her
I didnt know about that
And now youve got them both working towards the same goal the goal youve worked towards your entire life
Cersei I didnt know
the destruction of this family
I am the one preventing that from happening Daenerys didnt want to debate and negotiate She didnt want to bring you words She wanted to bring you fire and blood until I advised her otherwise I dont want to destroy our family I never have
You killed our father
After he sentenced me to death for a crime I didnt commit yes I killed him Hate me for it if you want I hate myself for it in spite of what he was in spite of what he did to me
Oh poor little man Your papa was mean to you Do you have any idea what you did when you fired that crossbow You left us open You laid us bare for the vultures and the vultures came and tore us apart You may not have killed Joffrey but you killed Myrcella you killed Tommen No one wouldve touched them if Father
I have never been more sorry about anything
I will not hear it not from you
I will not hear it
All right You love your family and I have destroyed it I will always be a threat So put an end to me
If it werent for me youd have a motherIf it werent for me youd have a father
I am more sorry about the children than you could ever know
I will not
I dont care I loved them You know I did You know it in your heart if theres anything left of it
It doesnt matter Your love doesnt matter Your feelings dont matter I dont care why you did what you did I only care what it cost us It cost us our future
If theres no future then why are we here Why did you allow me to come
Not to help my enemies collaborate in my destruction
Yes no not what you hoped for but you must have hoped for something
What did you hope for To make Jon Snow submit to your queen
Mm not like this
But eventually you want everyone to bend the knee to her
Yes
Why
Because I think she will make the world a better place
You said shed destroy Kings Landing
She knows herself She chose an advisor who would check her worst impulses instead of feeding them
Thats the difference between you I dont care about checking my worst impulses I dont care about making the world a better place Hang the world
That thing you dragged here I know what it is I know what it means And when it came at me I didnt think about the world Not at all As soon as it opened its mouth the world disappeared for me right down its black throat All I could think about was keeping those gnashing teeth away from the ones who matter most away from my family Maybe Euron Greyjoy had the right idea Get on a boat take those who matter
Youre pregnant
No one is less happy about this than I am
I know I respect what you did Wish you hadnt done it but I respect it
This place was the beginning of the end for my family A dragon is not a slave They were terrifying Extraordinary They filled people with wonder and awe and we locked them in here They wasted away They grew small And we grew small as well We werent extraordinary without them We were just like everyone else
Youre not like everyone else And your family hasnt seen its end Youre still here
I cant have children
Who told you that
The witch who murdered my husband
Has it occurred to you she might not have been a reliable source of information
You were right from the beginning If I had trusted you everything would be different
So what now
I cant forget what I saw north of the Wall And I cant pretend that Cersei wont take back half the country the moment I march north
It appears Tyrions assessment was correct Were fucked
My armies will not stand down I will not pull them back to the capital I will march them north to fight alongside you in the Great War The darkness is coming for us all Well face it together And when the Great War is over perhaps youll remember I chose to help with no promises or assurances from any of you I expect not Call our banners All of them
Its not easy for ravens to fly in these storms Perhaps Jon tried to send word earlier
No this is the way he is the way hes always been He never asked for my opinion Why would he start now
I cant believe hed surrender the Northern crown without consulting you
This is his writing his signature He pledged to fight for Daenerys Targaryen Hes bent the knee
Ive heard gossip that the Dragon Queen is quite beautiful
What does that have to do with anything
Jon is young and unmarried Daenerys is young and unmarried
You think he wants to marry her
An alliance makes sense Together theyd be difficult to defeat He was named King
Even if I wanted to Arya would never go along She always loved Jon far more than she ever loved me and shed kill anyone who betrayed her family
You are family too Would Arya really murder her own sister
Do you know what she is now Do you know what the Faceless Men are
Only by reputation They worship the God of Death I believe I never trust godly men
Theyre killers And Arya was one of them What do you think shes after
Shes your sister
She could want me dead because she thinks I wronged my family
Why did she come to Winterfell
To kill me for marrying our enemies and betraying my family
Why did she unearth the letter Cersei made you write
To provide proof of my betrayals To provide justification after she murders me
And after she murders you what does she become
If we have the Dothraki ride hard on the kingsroad theyll arrive at Winterfell within the fortnight
And the Unsullied We can sail with them to White Harbor meet the Dothraki here on the kingsroad then ride together to Winterfell
Perhaps you should fly to Winterfell Your Grace You have many enemies in the North Thousands fell fighting your fatherAll it takes is one angry man with a crossbow Hell see your silver hair on the kingsroad and know that one wellplaced bolt will make him a hero The man who killed the conqueror
Its your decision Your Grace But if were going to be allies in this war its important for the Northerners to see us as allies If we sail to White Harbor together I think it sends a better message
Ive not come to conquer the North Im coming to save the North We sail together
Jon
Can I speak with you
All right
What you did in Kings Landing what you said You couldve lied to Cersei about bending the knee to Daenerys You risked everything to tell an enemy the truth
We went down there to make peace And it seems to me we need to be honest with each other if were going to fight together
Youve always known what was right Even when we were all young and stupid you always knew Every step you take its always the right step
Its not It may seem that way from the outside but I promise you its not true Ive done plenty of things that I regret
Not compared to me you havent
No Not compared to you
I always wanted to do the right thing Be the right kind of person But I never knew what that meant It always seemed like theres like there was an impossible choice I had to make Stark or Greyjoy
Our father was more of a father
He was
And you betrayed him Betrayed his memory
I did
But you never lost him Hes a part of you Just like hes a part of me
But the things Ive done
Its not my place to forgive you for all of it But what I can forgive I do You dont need to choose Youre a Greyjoy and youre a Stark
When I was Ramsays prisoner Yara tried to save me Shes the only one who tried to save me She needs me now
So why are you still talking to me
Load up Load up lads Go on Tides coming in
All of us chose to follow Yara We left the Iron Islands for Yara She would never leave one of us behind Were not leaving her behind
Your sister
Shes not dead
Shes dead Even if Euron hasnt cut her throat yet shes dead
Shes our queen
Shes your sister
I did I ran from my uncle
So why in fucks name should we listen to you They say the dead cant swim Were going to sail east find a nice quiet island kill all the men and take their wives for ourselves
Were done with all that
Who says we are
Yara did She made a pledge Were going to find her and were going to set her free
Run away little Theon Its what you do best
He needs to shut his mouth
Hey
Oh yes
Thats more like it
Stay down or Ill kill you
I said stay down or Ill kill you
Not for me For Yara
Yara
Have my sister
Are you sure you want to do this
Its not what I want Its what honor demands
And what does honor demand
That I defend my family from those who would harm us That I defend the North from those who would betray us
All right then Get on with it
You stand accused of murder You stand accused of treason How do you answer these charges Lord Baelish
My sister
Lady Sansa forgive me Im a bit confused
Which charges confuse you Lets start with the simplest one you murdered our aunt Lysa Arryn You pushed her through the Moon Door and watched her fall Do you deny it
I did it to protect you
You did it to take power in the Vale Earlier you conspired to murder Jon
Whatever your aunt
You had Aunt Lysa send a letter to our parents telling them it was the Lannisters who murdered Jon
I know of no such letter
You conspired with Cersei Lannister and Joffrey Baratheon to betray our father
I deny it None of you were there to see what happened None of you knows the truth
You held a knife to his throat
You said I did warn you not the trust me
You told our mother
Lady Sansa I have known you since you were a girl Ive protected you
Protected me By selling me to the Boltons
If we could speak alone I can explain everything
Sometimes when Im trying to understand a persons motives I play a little game I assume the worst Whats the worst reason you have for turning me against my sisterThats what you do isnt it Thats what youve always done turn family against family turn sister against sister Thats what you did to our mother
Sansa please
Im a slow learner its true But I learn
Give me a chance to defend myself I deserve that
I am Lord Protector of the Vale and I command you to escort me safely back to the Eyrie
I think not
Sansa I beg you I loved your mother since the time I was a boy
And yet you betrayed her
I loved you More than anyone
And yet you betrayed me
When you brought me back to Winterfell you told me theres no justice in the world not unless we make it Thank you for all your many lessons Lord Baelish I will never forget them
Sansa I
Our men in Kings Landing will march north in three days time
Itll take us a fortnight just to gather supplies for the train
We dont have a fortnight If the North falls we fall Three days The remaining forces in the Westerlands will take the river road east Well meet at Lord Harroways Town and march together to Winterfell
Ser Jaime
Your Grace
My lords I need a moment with my brother
Your Grace
What are you doing
Preparing the expedition north
Expedition north I always knew you were the stupidest Lannister The Starks and Targaryens have united against us and you want to fight alongside them Are you a traitor or an idiot
You pledged our forces to fight our common enemy
Ill say whatever I need to say to ensure the survival of our house You expect me to trust the man who murdered our father
You saw it with your own eyes You saw a dead man trying to kill us
I saw it burn If dragons cant stop them if Dothraki and Unsullied and Northmen cant stop them how will our armies make a difference
This isnt about noble houses this is about the living and the dead
And I intend to stay amongst the living Let the Stark boy and his new queen
I made a promise
Our child will rule Westeros
Our child will never be born if the dead come south
The monsters are real The white walkers the dragons the Dothraki screamers all the frightening stories we heard when we were young theyre all real So be it Let the monsters kill each other And while they battle in the North we take back the lands that belong to us
And then what
And then we rule
When the fighting in the North is over someone wins You understand that dont you If the dead win they march south and kill us all If the living win and weve betrayed them they march south and kill us all
The Targaryens and the Starks already want to kill us all Most of them will die in the North
I faced them in the field We cant beat them We cant beat their dragons
How many dragons did you see at the pit
Two
What happened to the third
For all we know its guarding her fleet
She came here with her dragons and her Dothraki and her Unsullied She came here to show us all her power No something happenedThe dragons are vulnerable
We cant beat the Dothraki We dont have the numbers We dont have the support of the other houses
No we have something better We have the Iron Bank You shouldve listened more when Father
The Golden Company is not here Theyre in Essos How is a mercenary company in Essos going to help us
Do you really think Euron Greyjoy turned tail and sailed back to the Iron Islands Do you think he abandoned the chance to marry the queen
You plotted with Euron Greyjoy without telling me the commander
And you conspired with Tyrion the man who murdered our father without telling me your queen
I didnt conspire with him
You met with him in secret without my consent You planned to promote my enemies interests That is the definition of conspiracy
I pledged to ride north I intend to honor that pledge
And that will be treason
Treason
Disobeying your queen
Doesnt matter what Id call it
I told you no one walks away from me
Are you going to order him to kill me Im the only one you have left Our children are gone
Theres one more yet to come
Give the order then
I dont believe you
Come in
Samwell Tarly
I wasnt sure if youd remember me
I remember everything
You helped us get beyond the Wall Youre a good man
Oh well thank you but um Im not sure that I am What happened to you beyond the Wall
I became the ThreeEyed Raven
Oh I dont know what that means
I can see things that happened in the past I can see things happening now all over the world Why did you come to Winterfell
Um Jons the one to lead the fight against the dead I know he is But he cant do it alone so Ive come here to help him
Hes on his way back to Winterfell with Daenerys Targaryen You you saw this in a vision
Oh
He needs to know the truth
The truth about what
About himself No one knows No one but me Jon isnt really my fathers son Hes the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and my aunt
Its not
Dornish bastards are named Sand
At the Citadel I transcribed a High Septons diary He annulled Rhaegars marriage to Elia He wed Rhaegar and Lyanna in a secret ceremony
Are you certain
Its what the High Septon wrote in his private diary I dont know why hed lie Is this something you can see
Father Smith Warrior Mother Maiden Crone Stranger I am hers and she is mine from this day until the end of my days
Father Smith Warrior Mother Maiden Crone Stranger I am his and he is mine from this day until the end of my days
Roberts Rebellion was built on a lie Rhaegar didnt kidnap my aunt
He loved her And she loved him
And Jon Jons real name
His name is Aegon
Hes never been a bastard
He needs to know We need to tell him
Are you all right
Its just strange In his own horrible way I believe he loved me
You did the right thing
You did it
Im just the executioner You passed the sentence Youre the Lady
Does that bother you
I was never going to be as good a lady as you So I had to be something else I never could have survived what you survived
You would have Youre the strongest person I know
I believe thats the nicest thing youve ever said to me
Well dont get used to it Youre still very strange and annoying
In winter we must protect ourselves Look after one another
I miss him
Me too
Its a long way down
Yeah The crows keep telling me Ill get used to it
I can see movement Watch on the tree line
What is it
Come on Run Run
