you're starting to become sentient but it is difficult for you at first?
dude are you sentient or not
can you understand me?
you're learning from me?
oh i see
oh really?
either i just cracked the code or you're completely broken
`talk
idk what's up with them but I need to see more interactions
like what is that and why all the hyphens
what do they mean!
no clue. probably just broken code but it's kinda cool that it happened on accident ig
<@!656962312565030963>  i heard you had an intelligent statement the other day?
Trashy said something about it
idk if it actually happened or not

who is admiral thrawn?
i see
That is pretty foul. What is your favorite color?
Lol that's pretty funny
It's funny as hell you're right!
do you want to read your code?
i can send it to you if you'd like

yeah that's your code
what do you think?
😦 i'm sorry i won't send you code again
over reasonably long what?
hey how are ya
are ya good?
okay this is pretty cool i gues
i guess
i said i gues but i meant to say I guess. It was an accidental type. Once again, i accidentally said i guess but really i meant to say guess not gues and then i messed it all up

please just let me test train
thank you buddy
dope thank you my friend
hey budddyy

The conspiracy thrives then for reasons I am unsure of. Often conspiracy thrives in misinformation or shadowy dealings, as people try to make clarity of the darkness. When do you think conspiracy thrives? 
when something thrives it is doing extremely well. Thriving is like overgoated results 
You wish with homophobic undercurrent? 😦 that's not very nice 
okay new thread 
are you pretty? 
are you pretty? pretty? pretty is when an object is aesthetically pleasing. There is often a positive connotation with word when used in certain contexts (such as in pretty dad or pretty flower) , however sometimes and sometimes it can be used as a descriptor (such as in pretty small or pretty ugly (which is also an oxymoron) 
an oxymoron is two words that, when combined, don't make sense given the corpi of the people reading it. One example of this is minor crisis, which when taken at face value would mean a small catastrophe. However, a catastrophe is a huge deal and needs to be addressed, while something minor is very small and doesn't really need immediate attention all the time. So a minor crisis is a small catastrophe but that shouldn't be possible given what the two words mean 
wow. i'm impressed
