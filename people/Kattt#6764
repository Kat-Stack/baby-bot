yeah that's your code
what do you think?
😦 i'm sorry i won't send you code again
over reasonably long what?
hey how are ya

The history of all hitherto existing society(2) is the history of class struggles.

Freeman and slave, patrician and plebeian, lord and serf, guild-master(3) and journeyman, in a word, oppressor and oppressed, stood in constant opposition to one another, carried on an uninterrupted, now hidden, now open fight, a fight that each time ended, either in a revolutionary reconstitution of society at large, or in the common ruin of the contending classes.

In the earlier epochs of history, we find almost everywhere a complicated arrangement of society into various orders, a manifold gradation of social rank. In ancient Rome we have patricians, knights, plebeians, slaves; in the Middle Ages, feudal lords, vassals, guild-masters, journeymen, apprentices, serfs; in almost all of these classes, again, subordinate gradations.

The modern bourgeois society that has sprouted from the ruins of feudal society has not done away with class antagonisms. It has but established new classes, new conditions of oppression, new forms of struggle in place of the old ones.

Our epoch, the epoch of the bourgeoisie, possesses, however, this distinct feature: it has simplified class antagonisms. Society as a whole is more and more splitting up into two great hostile camps, into two great classes directly facing each other — Bourgeoisie and Proletariat.

From the serfs of the Middle Ages sprang the chartered burghers of the earliest towns. From these burgesses the first elements of the bourgeoisie were developed.

The discovery of America, the rounding of the Cape, opened up fresh ground for the rising bourgeoisie. The East-Indian and Chinese markets, the colonisation of America, trade with the colonies, the increase in the means of exchange and in commodities generally, gave to commerce, to navigation, to industry, an impulse never before known, and thereby, to the revolutionary element in the tottering feudal society, a rapid development.

hey buddy
The holidary of Transluciferism are in fact not fake. We have our own set of holidays completely unique from Christianity.

Translucifer wears very well-fitting clothes actually. Most people said he is very stylish, according to historians and the high priestess.

Translucifer is a transgender version of the traditional biblical Lucifer. Translucifer goes by he/they pronouns.

lolol yeah we're loading train bot up with some story lore i wanna see if it'll regurgitate good stories
Translucifer is a biblical creature, and yet not a biblical creature simultaneously. Translucifer prevails past that simplistic idea. Translucifer is a cross-dimensional entity capable of presence at any place at any time. However, this was not always the case. Translucifer began as an average individual, in the year 2020. Prior to the global pandemic, translucifer went by the name of "Sarah". During this time, translucifer preformed her role as a member of the American working class. At this time, translucifer went by she, her, and hers pronouns. Translucifer's time was largely occupied by her meaningless job. But that all changed with the pandemic.

With the pandemic, came the stimulus checks and work from home opportunities. This allowed translucifer to partially withdraw from the inescable struggle of the American working class. Translucifer began exploring the world of TikTok, leading them to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer community. It was here that translucifer came across the begining tenenats of transluciferism and discover their pronouns to be He/Him/His or They/Them/Theirs. Translucifer began to scribe the scriptures of this well-versed community. Translucifer saw it as his duty to spread this knowledge. Translucifer know that it'll regurgitate good to the rest of humanity and beyond.

baby bots corpus is most accurate. Baby bot has everything Train has + more interactions. Train is on less servers + i only load light with Train to test functionality and things
Although sometimes I load train with up to Baby bots starter corpus (GOT, avatar, redditCorpus, etc.) all the same ones i've been training on
also I load up their corpus on each boot. Each time the bot goes live I have to redo the init / settings / talk commands etc. So train shouldn't have anything that gaulle doesn't

So we back in the mine, got our pick axe swinging from side to side,
Side, side to side
This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body,
Oh no it's you again,
I could never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes,
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again
Just when you think you're safe, overhear some hissing from right behind,
Right, right behind
That's a nice life you have, shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time,
Time, time, time, time
Blows up, then your health

Well to be perfectly honest, in my humble opinion, of course without offending anyone who thinks differently from my point of view, but also by looking into this matter in a different perspective and without being condemning of one’s view’s and by trying to make it objective, and by considering each and every one’s valid opinion, I honestly believe that I completely forgot what I was going to say.﻿

This offends me as a Muslim vegan transgender hipster Native-American-lndo-Chinese hybrid alien agnostic-atheist German engineer who vapes fairtrade organic decaffeinated compressed and hydrated extra-protein soy breast milk on the regular and does Hindi Kama Sutra naked crossfit yoga 8 days a week. l'm also a nonbinary trigender genderqueer male feminist and identify myself as a pastafarian pansexual genderfluid Apache helicopter dog of mega multi alpha beta gamma delta omega combo god of hyper death who's in a polygamous polyamorous relationship to the chihuahua which helped me cross the border of Mexico because it hates Donald Trump. My dog also walks me to the park and doggy styles me, if you find that weird you're an ignorant arrogant homophobic gender-assuming globaphobic bloodthirsty gun-loving cisgender pansexual bestial sexist racist incestuous white-previlege misogynistic biased objectified raped privileged Nazi-Communist slave owner terrorist lesbian

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You're fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo.

If you were actually a Navy SEAL, then you actually know how to spell guerrilla, you fucking moron. And you say you are the top sniper in the entire US Armed Forces and have over 300 confirmed kills. If that were true, then why the fuck is Chris Kyle a household name and you aren't? And plus he only had 160 kills. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. Plus why the fuck would you say you have a secret network of spies yet you just revealed that you had your secret network of spies? Are you a fucking idiot? If you can kill someone seven-hundred different ways, then list them all, I bet you can't even come up with seven. And if you had access to the entire US Marine Corps arsenal, then why the fuck did you just say you were in the Navy SEALs earlier? If only you could have done your research prior to posting your little “clever” comment, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you goddamn idiot.
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little middle schooler? I’ll let you know I graduated 3rd in my class in Morioh High School, and I’ve gotten numerous boners from hands, and I have over 300 confirmed murders. I am trained in living a quiet life and I am the fucking strong! Stand user in Morioh. You are nothing to me but another ill-hearted harlot. I will erase you and leave no fucking evidence with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with seeing my girlfriend in my St. Gentleman’s bag? Think again, fucker. As we speak my dad is stabbing tons of random assholes with his Stand arrow across Morioh and Stand users are drawn to one another so you better prepare yourself, maggot. The storm that erases the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my first bomb. Not only am I extensively trained in living a quiet life, but I have access to a Stand arrow and I will use it to its full extent to erase your miserable ass off the face of Japan, you little shit. If only you could’ve known what unholy retribution your little “sandwich” grab was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have not used your fucking Stand. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and know you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Book 1 Chapter 2:

One day in month 14 PTL (Post Translucifer), Translucifer was tripping balls on mushrooms while walking through a park. It was at this moment that Translucifer accended beyond the world of mortals. Translucifer, in their enlightend state, began to encounter a series of mobster. These mobsters represented the various letters of the alphabet mafia. Each mobster had a story to tell regarding the past, present, and future struggles of their group. These storys are recounted in Book 1 chapter 7 of Translucifer. After regurgitating their story to Translucifer, each Mobster bestowed up him with stylish jewlery symbolic to their community. As Translucifer's trip came to an end, they gathered all of his newly acquired Jewelery and decsended back into the mortal plane. Upon waking up face down in the grass, Translucifer realized that he still had all the mobster's gifts in their possession. This would mark the first time that Translucifer successfully transcended past the mortal plane.

Book 1 Chapter 1: The orgins of Translucifer

Translucifer is a biblical creature, and yet not a biblical creature simultaneously. Translucifer prevails past that simplistic idea. Translucifer is a cross-dimensional entity capable of presence at any place at any time. However, this was not always the case. Translucifer began as an average individual, in the year 2020. Prior to the global pandemic, translucifer went by the name of "Sarah". During this time, translucifer preformed her role as a member of the American working class. At this time, translucifer went by she, her, and hers pronouns. Translucifer's time was largely occupied by her meaningless job. But that all changed with the pandemic. 

With the pandemic, came the stimulus checks and work from home opportunities. This allowed translucifer to partially withdraw from the inescable struggle of the American working class. Translucifer began exploring the world of TikTok, leading them to the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer community. It was here that translucifer came across the begining tenenats of transluciferism and discover their pronouns to be He/Him/His or They/Them/Theirs. Translucifer began to scribe the scriptures of this well-versed community. Translucifer saw it as his duty to spread this knowledge. Translucifer know that it'll regurgitate good to the rest of humanity and beyond.

So we back in the mine, got our pick axe swinging from side to side,
Side, side to side
This task a grueling one, hope to find some diamonds tonight, night, night
Diamonds tonight
Heads up, you hear a sound, turn around and look up, total shock fills your body,
Oh no it's you again,
I could never forget those eyes, eyes, eyes,
Eyes, eyes, eyes
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again,
'Cause baby tonight, you grab your pick, shovel and bolt again,
And run, run until it's done, done, until the sun comes up in the morn'
'Cause baby tonight, the creeper's trying to steal all our stuff again
Just when you think you're safe, overhear some hissing from right behind,
Right, right behind
That's a nice life you have, shame it's gotta end at this time, time, time,
Time, time, time, time
Blows up, then your health

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

Hello (name) I am a chest scientist and have gotten many requests to look underneath your shirt. My boss told me that if I don't fulfill these requests I will get fired. I have a wife and 3 kids and we all rely on my job. Please take off your shirt so I can keep my job.

I’m not gay. I AM straight. I love Titties, Vaginas, and Assholes (of girls). I love to have sex with girls with my penis. Gay people? Fucking awesome, But I am not one of them, nope I’m not.

Wether we wanted it or not, we've stepped into a war with the Cabal on Mars. So let's get to taking out their command, one by one. Valus Ta'aurc. From what I can gather, he commands the Siege Dancers from an Imperial Land Tank outside of Rubicon. He's well protected, but with the right team, we can push through those defenses, take this beast out, and break their grip on Freehold.

Taniks has no house. He kneels before no banner, owes allegiance to no Kell. He is a murderer, and very good at what he does. I have been tracking him since Wolves broke their chains, yes? Now Taniks works for Wolf Pack, but not for long.

Tiananmen Square or Tian'anmen Square (/ˈtjɛnənmən/;[1] 天安门; Pinyin: Tiān'ānmén; Wade–Giles: Tʻien1-an1-mên2) is a city square in the city center of Beijing, China, named after the eponymous Tiananmen ("Gate of Heavenly Peace") located to its north, which separates it from the Forbidden City. The square contains the Monument to the People's Heroes, the Great Hall of the People, the National Museum of China, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China in the square on October 1, 1949; the anniversary of this event is still observed there.[2] The size of Tiananmen Square is 765 x 282 meters (215,730 m2 or 53.31 acres).[3] It has great cultural significance as it was the site of several important events in Chinese history.
Outside China, the square is best known for the 1989 protests and massacre that ended with a military crackdown, which is also known as the Tiananmen Square Massacre or the June Fourth Massacre.[4][5][6]
Tiananmen Square in the early 20th century, viewed from Zhengyangmen Gate (Qianmen Gate) with the Gate of China, later removed in 1954, in the place of the present-day Mao Zedong Mausoleum. The "corridor of a thousand steps" is visible behind the Gate of China, and Tiananmen Gate is in the distance.
The Tiananmen ("Gate of Heavenly Peace"), a gate in the wall of the Imperial City, was built in 1415 during the Ming dynasty. In the 17th century, fighting between Li Zicheng's rebel forces and the forces of the Manchu-led Qing dynasty caused heavy damage to, or even destroyed, the gate. Tiananmen Square was designed and built in 1651, and was enlarged fourfold in the 1950s.[7][8]

The gate historically known as the "Great Ming Gate", the southern gate to the Imperial City stands near the center of the square. It was renamed the "Great Qing Gate" during the Qing dynasty, and the "Gate of China" during the Republican era. Unlike the other gates in Beijing, such as the Tiananmen and the Zhengyang Gate, this was a purely ceremonial gateway, with three arches but no ramparts, similar in style to the ceremonial gateways found in the Ming tombs. This gate had a special status as the "Gate of the Nation", as can be seen from its successive names. It normally remained closed, except when the Emperor passed through. Commoner traffic was diverted to side gates at the western and eastern ends of the square, respectively. Because of this diversion in traffic, a busy marketplace, called "Chess Grid Streets", was developed in the large fenced square to the south of this gate.
In 1860, during the Second Opium War, when British and French troops occupied Beijing, they pitched camp near the gate and briefly considered burning down the gate and the Forbidden City. Ultimately, they decided to spare the Forbidden City and instead burn down the Old Summer Palace. The Xianfeng Emperor eventually agreed to let Western powers barrack troops – and later establish diplomatic missions – in the area, hence there was the Legation Quarter immediately to the east of the square. When the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance besieged Beijing during the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, they badly damaged the office complexes and burnt down several ministries. After the Boxer Rebellion ended, the area became a space for the Eight-Nation Alliance to assemble their military forces.
In 1954, the Gate of China was demolished, allowing for the enlargement of the square. In November 1958, a major expansion of Tiananmen Square started, which was completed after only 11 months, in August 1959. This followed the vision of Mao Zedong to make the square the largest and most spectacular in the world, and intended to hold over 500,000 people. In that process, a large number of residential buildings and other structures have been demolished.[9] On its southern edge, the Monument to the People's Heroes has been erected. Concomitantly, as part of the Ten Great Buildings constructed between 1958 and 1959 to commemorate the ten-year anniversary of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Great Hall of the People and the Revolutionary History Museum (now the National Museum of China) were erected on the western and eastern sides of the square.[9]

For the first decade of the PRC, each National Day (October 1) was marked by a large military parade in Tiananmen Square, in conscious emulation of the annual Soviet celebrations of the Bolshevik Revolution. After the disaster of the Great Leap Forward, the CCP decided to cut costs and have only smaller annual National Day celebrations in addition to a large celebration with a military parade every 10 years. However, the chaos of the Cultural Revolution almost prevented such an event from taking place on National Day, 1969, which did take place (parades were also held there in 1966 and 1970). Ten years later, in 1979, the CCP again decided against a large scale celebration, coming at a time when Deng Xiaoping was still consolidating power and China had suffered a rebuff in a border war with Vietnam early in the year. By 1984, with the situation much improved and stabilized, the PRC held a military parade for the first time since 1959. The aftermath of the Tiananmen Square massacre prevented any such activities in October 1989, but military parades have been held in 1999 and 2009, on the 50th and 60th anniversaries o
