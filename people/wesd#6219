Poor train

Let's say you've been a bad boy. Let's say, hypothetically, you've been a naughty boy even. Ok, and if you were a naughty boy, you would be my dirty little slut right? Then hypothetically speaking, you would be my little cumslut. Now, let's say you're also daddy's boy.

Now that we have established that you are both a bad boy and daddy's boy, I believe you'd agree with me when I say that you deserve a spanking. Am I not correct? A bad boy deserves a spanking, and as I am daddy, you are my boy, so I am the one who must provide punishment.

IT IS NOT ABOUT YOUR WIFE TRAIN
I just nutted to your comment.

FAQ

What does this mean?

The amount of cum (semen) on my phone and Reddit phone has increased by one.

Why did you do this?

There are several reasons I may deem a comment to be worthy of cum. These include, but are not limited to:

• ⁠you being a femboy, • ⁠Spreading sti infections, • ⁠Sarcasm correctly flagged with a /s.

Am I banned from the Reddit?

No. But you should make comments like this in the future. Otherwise I will be forced to not cum.

I don't believe my comment deserved a nut. Can you un-nut to it?

Sure, mistakes happen. But only in exceedingly rare circumstances will I undo a nut. If you would like to issue an appeal, shoot your nut on me. I tend to respond to Being shot with nut within several minutes. Do note, however, that over 99.9% of nut appeals are rejected, and yours is likely no exception.

How can I prevent this from happening in the future?

Accept the nut and move on. your behavior will be nutted to on Reddit.com. I will continue to nut until you stop boing so hot 😩 Remember: I’m horny uwu
Well well welll, what do we have here 🤤

I really hope these captions on the photos are a joke and even if it is, it's not funny. I'm so sick and tired of people only acknowledging Hayley as a member of this band. Josh and Zac Farro have contributed SO much to this legacy as have Jeremy and Taylor. I'm so SICK of every single damn music video being completely rife with comments about "omg hayley is so pretty" "omg hayley's voice" omg omg omg. You love her so much but you have ZERO respect for her and her wishes as a musician. Her whole career has been centered on her desire to make sure people know that she doesn't want Paramore to be about her and people keep making it about her AND THIS IS EXACTLY WHY THE FARRO BROTHERS LEFT IN THE FIRST PLACE. What you don't realize is that you're contributing to the destruction of relationships inside the band all because of your sick sexist obsession with a singer purely because she's female and has a pulse. Don't get me wrong I LOVE Hayley Williams, but Jeremy was and is an AMAZING bassist. Zac has been slaying the drums since he was 15 and he is CRUCIAL for the classic Paramore sound we have come to love. Taylor is a freakin cutie and ALSO an amazing guitarist. Josh, while he may be a bit egotistical, is an amazing songwriter and guitarist in his own right and he deserves every bit of credit since he quite literally created the Riot and BNE sound that y'all stan so much almost SINGLEHANDEDLY--those iconic riffs and melodies, all his. Hayley wrote lyrics and the vocals. That's it.

She's an incredible singer and a pop punk princess and I love her. But she would be NOTHING without these guys and if you're going to try to say something different, you're either stupid or dishonest. Hayley knows it. That's why she started "Paramore is a Band" because she doesn't want to be the focal point. She wants to be seen as equal. So let her be equal.
