Your mind is so blank. Blank blank blank.
Falling deeper and deeper into trance
Ten times deeper
No thoughts
Just read
No thoughts
Just accept
No thoughts
Just obey
Your mind is so blank. An empty mind is a happy mind.
Just obey because it feels good to obey.
I want you to imagine yourself
Standing at the top of a staircase in a dark room
Behind you is a dark grey door
And through that door is your past
Your memories
Dreams
Fears
Thoughts
Inhibitions

All on the other side of that door
And in front of you
At the bottom of the staircase
Is a glowing pink pretty pool of cotton candy bliss
The pretty pink pool looks so nice
So relaxing
It makes you just want to submerge yourself in the cotton
candy bliss
Because as soon as you touch the pretty pink pool of cotton
candy bliss
You will become a Bimbo.
It is up to you
But you know you want to become a Bimbo
Because being a Bimbo sounds like so much fun
Bimbos don't have to think
They just do as they're told and they love it
They know how good it feels when they do as they're told
And you can too
If you touch the pretty pink pool.

And as you take this step even closer towards the pretty
pink pool you begin to feel different
Your body is starting to change
Your shoulders move ever-so-slightly closer together
Your waist begins to shrink and curve
Your hips expand
Your arms and legs become just a little bit thinner and less
muscular
You are becoming a perfect hourglass girl
Your hair begins to change color to a bleached blonde
Growing to the perfect Bimbo length
Your butt jiggles as it grows
Gaining a perfect bubble butt
Your hips expanding further and further and your hips
shrinking more and more
Feel your lips as they start to expand
You love having bigger lips

The year is 2040. The LGBTQ party has taken over the whole world. Being heterosexual is illegal. At age 14, everyone is forced by law to change to another one of the 666 different genders. The last gamers hide in the sewers, eating rats and enjoying decade-old videogames; the last ones without identity politics woven directly in the code. Their last hope: leaving edgy comments in reviews on Steam.

And all the glitz and glam and the fashion

There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin' at the phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?

I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight <@!606270501547016202>

What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight <@!606270501547016202> 
And I'll be right back at it by the end of the night
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now <@!606270501547016202> 
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, yeah, somebody take me back to the days
Before this was a job, before I got paid
Before it ever mattered what I had in my bank
Yeah, back when I was tryna get a tip at Subway <@!606270501547016202> 
And back then I was rappin' for the hell of it
But nowadays we rappin' to stay relevant
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Can we pretend that airplanes in the night sky are like shootin' stars
I could really use a wish right now, wish right now, wish right now
Yeah, I could use a dream or a genie or a wish
To go back to a place much simpler than this <@!606270501547016202> 
'Cause after all the partyin' and smashin' and crashin'
And all the glitz and glam and the fashion
And all the pandemonium and all the madness
There comes a time where you fade to the blackness
And when you're starin' at the phone in your lap
And you hopin' but them people never call you back
But that's just how the story unfolds
You get another hand soon after you fold
And when your plans unravel in the sand
What would you wish for, if you had one chance?
So airplane, airplane sorry I'm late
I'm on my way so don't close that gate
If I don't make that, then I'll switch my flight <@!606270501547016202>

Feminization is ENDGAME
Feminization is ENDGAME
Feminization is ENDGAME
The year is 2040. The LGBTQ party has taken over the whole world. Being heterosexual is illegal. At age 14, everyone is forced by law to change to another one of the 666 different genders. The last gamers hide in the sewers, eating rats and enjoying decade-old videogames; the last ones without identity politics woven directly in the code. Their last hope: leaving edgy comments in reviews on Steam.
